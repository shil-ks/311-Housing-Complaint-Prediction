0,B001E4KFG0,A3SGXH7AUHU8GW,delmartian,1/1,1303862400,Good Quality Dog Food,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
20,B001GVISJM,A1WO0KGLPR5PV6,mom2emma,0/0,1313452800,Always fresh,My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty. packed well and arrive in a timely manner.
49,B001EO5QW8,A276999Y6VRSCQ,JMay,0/1,1334016000,Same stuff,This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.
50,B001EO5QW8,A108P30XVUFKXY,Roberto A,0/7,1203379200,Don't like it,This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy. soft. I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.
78,B004X2KR36,A2AB7M9UCNBVN7,sharonh4,0/0,1346976000,Order only in cold weather,The taste was great. but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.
85,B0019CW0HE,A25BGFRHYHEZKK,Toby's mom,4/4,1292889600,Great food!,We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him. no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.
135,B003OB0IB8,A2BZNXMV0LC7OE,Alanna,0/0,1333756800,Tastes great. but is cheaper locally.,I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime. so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping). the price on amazon isn't bad at all. but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.
145,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,MarkD,2/2,1240012800,Sweet with a nice kick!,Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while. I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet. just sweet enough and although it's mild. it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price. it's a steal!
148,B0064KU9HO,AJFIH0DZYJF7T,Lisa Barton,0/0,1350345600,Ehhh...,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.
172,B001IUKD76,A2K8UBI64T0BM8,A. Carriglio,3/3,1262131200,Delicious!,I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that. I love this product!
202,B0028C44Z0,A3TIC20I6XI297,dog lover,0/0,1320451200,Altoids,Received as shown. My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them. It was great i could get them on Amazon.
206,B0028C44Z0,A5F7YR0G7H9HR,Ma J. Vargas Peña,0/1,1315180800,fresh!,Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.
208,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,Atl Chris Atl Chris,0/3,1314489600,These just don't do it for me as breath mints,To me. these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin. and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong. and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person. but still. one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point. I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.
231,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,Bold Consumer,0/0,1333843200,Really Nice Taste!,I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg). Organic Black Tea (600 mg). Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg). Proprietary blend (600 mg). plus some Ginseng (panax). Orange Peel. Lemon Grass. and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one.
232,B003ZFXJDW,A2HL6876LDPJIM,flageolet,0/0,1343692800,just give me some watermelon and citron sea salt,i cannot live without this citron falksalt. it is wonderful on watermelon. fish. almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon. wonderful experience.
272,B000LKZK7C,A1VKNACW03M5H7,Patilo,0/0,1296950400,Thanks for the review Scott,I thought this was a great buy. but as noted by Scott D.. the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content Sugar in the Raw.  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess I'll watch for the next crop.
274,B000LKZK7C,A34HSMRAQY5XKX,Nori Silverrage Nori,0/0,1285718400,Awesome Sugar!,Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff.
279,B001D07IPG,A3OM7Q1IVAGLUW,Pertigal,0/0,1275436800,Very tasty chips!,So many healthy products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.
285,B000H13270,A1YLOZQKBX3J1S,R. Lee Dailey Lee_Dailey,1/4,1221177600,too expensive,howdy y'all.<br /><br />the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however. it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.<br /><br />as i said. TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.<br /><br />take care.<br />lee
286,B000H13270,AVQIRN6E7J7UA,imdebra,0/4,1280534400,Not mild enough for me lol,Nothing wrong with the product. but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a baby-mouth - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison. I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel. mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes. was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.
293,B001UJEN6C,A2VBZOK3SVSDWA,Jennifer Gray,3/3,1294790400,Way better than Guayaki!,I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine. even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)
329,B003VTN95K,A3GLQSR6MTHXGL,Donna Kelly,0/0,1330214400,coffee-mate creamer,This seller is very nice.  And the price is very good.  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free. and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take. I would get this product from them.
358,B0041QJSJS,A1KZUXE70GYNGO,talonmedic,0/0,1347926400,Love Weavers. I am a fan.,I hadn't tried (or heard of) till recently Weavers not it's my favorite. I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet. they're all so darned smooth. No bite. no after taste. a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far.
369,B002O3VHXU,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,C. F. Hill CFH,1/1,1282176000,Very Smooth Coffee - Highly Recommended,Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA>Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK>Coffee People. Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] I generally drink in the morning.<br /><br />These are good on both Small and Large cup settings as well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
371,B002O3VHXU,A2129VQGGHR150,Carol C.,0/0,1313366400,My favorite,Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak.
374,B0057FTBYO,A5IWYNX8RHRKL,J. D. Laughead jdlaughead,0/0,1347840000,Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup,This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup. the best I have ever eaten. with large hearty chunks of chicken.and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied. and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont.
375,B0087HW5E2,A139RTDNMU3WY5,blanket lady,2/2,1339977600,Greatest Oil since slice bread !!!!!!!,I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking.  I love the regular. I use it on everything. You won't be sorry you tired it. great for dipping bread and cooking omelet. and green beans.
377,B003YXWAF8,AS89BWXQRDAMV,crpar,2/3,1335139200,Deliciously scrumptious,Sir Kensington's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product. The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update. and now leaves me disappointed when I'm given Heinz while out at a restaurant.<br /><br />For you Heinz die hard fans out there. this is not the ketchup for you. But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz. be sure to give this Ketchup a try.<br /><br />Don't forget the spiced variety. Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go.
412,B00061KYVI,A3JE18D4XD2PYF,pattymelt,0/0,1282521600,best roast ever,This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available!
417,B000SEJ842,A2IJOBHJXEZSS2,mosslake,0/0,1312934400,Look elsewhere for your whole grains,A vile. miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I don't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk. baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Nature's Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage.
427,B000G6RYNE,A1ELZC3WXWILX2,B. Carter,0/0,1333670400,a slight taste of jalapeno,one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties. and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno. and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.<br />If you like being addicted. these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...
431,B000G6RYNE,A2OEUROGZDTXUJ,J. Graves,0/0,1327881600,Delicious!,Now. I haven't done a side-by-side comparison. but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes. please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.
443,B000G6RYNE,AYB4ELCS5AM8P,John B. Goode JBG,0/0,1300579200,Excellent!,What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural. according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor. but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags. which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said. there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off. but it's true! And at least this way. you'll get rid of some of the oil.
458,B000G6RYNE,A3RB0YBBYGXBYE,Matt C. Mattman,0/0,1256083200,Delicious as always!,Oh. I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am. and when I do find them. they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon.
474,B000G6RYNE,A3UCO7B9HP42BG,Denise Graner,0/0,1217203200,Great chips,We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken. always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!
483,B000G6RYNE,AOHRHPJP38LLT,S. Samoranos Inspired cook,0/0,1214784000,70% of the chips in the bag are over cooked,I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
484,B000G6RYNE,A1AXXMJQ3NDIFK,Barbara A. Puckett,0/0,1214697600,Great chips!,For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.
526,B000G6RYNE,A1MFG9E45RX5OW,dolphins,4/4,1202688000,Best Salt & Vinegar!,I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :)
529,B000G6RYNE,AY1EF0GOH80EK,Natasha Stryker,3/3,1327708800,Do not miss the salt!,Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor. wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case. I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!
530,B000G6RYNE,AWLK6NSSV0YNA,Midwest Mommy,3/3,1234915200,Great deal,These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!
546,B000G6RYNE,A21D8LH2CD2EIZ,Tim,1/4,1286928000,Taste terrible. way too strong,Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar. i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had. and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad. besides being salty and sour. they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste. you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste. so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.  But normal people. please do not try this at home.
550,B000G6RYNE,A3ARC3UIY3Z1KQ,Patricia A. Cioffi SHOPPING JUNKIE,2/6,1238976000,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
555,B000G6RYNE,A3D7FUBG14QWKX,Linda,0/4,1330732800,Garbage,Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these. and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can.
563,B000G6RYNE,A320QA9HJFUOZO,Zach Morris,7/9,1203984000,orgasmic,Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice. a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors. alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs. not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips.
569,B000G6RYNE,AG7EF0SVBQOUX,WriterGirl WriterGirl,2/2,1323388800,My favorite flavor,I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
593,B000G6RYNE,A3L5L1NZIKLSJU,E. Demir emiko,1/1,1289433600,Kettle Chips. Sea Salt,There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips. you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands. fresh out of box. very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot. I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent. if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice. except salt. as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The best by date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.
600,B000G6RYNE,A3RMGIKUWGPZOK,Jean Visnefski,1/1,1245024000,Fantastic,I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible.  I didn't expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.  I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick. crunchy chips.  The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open.  Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.
620,B000G6RYNE,A2PYL0PSX5MQYQ,JS from Maryland,5/7,1306281600,Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips,The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However. Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used. with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag.  Sadly. the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes. Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil. Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup. Honey)Salt. Garlic Powder. Jalapeno Pepper. Ground ginger. Onion Powder. Habanero Pepper. Dried Parsley. Citric Acid. Cilantro Extract. Ginger Oil. Cayenne Pepper. White Pepper. Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes. safflower and/or sunflower oil. sugar. dried cane syrup. salt. maltodextrin. yeast extract. spices. garlic powder. onion powder. dried parsley. jalapeno powder. citric acid. natural flavors. lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner.  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  Great Taste Naturally from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!
625,B000G6RYNE,A3M174IC0VXOS2,Gail Cooke,2/3,1245024000,CRISPY. CRUNCHY. AND ROBUST,We've long enjoyed this brand of chip. so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic. generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.
636,B000G6RYNE,ACJW2YSBG2HA1,i am me,0/0,1336694400,These chips are awesome if not best but....,I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.
654,B002BCD2OG,A2LYOW4YW8R2HO,Richard C. Washburn,12/12,1292371200,These weigh 46 oz. NOT 46 fluid ounces,Good quality nectar.  Very tasty.<br /><br />However. I was expecting 46 fluid ounces. not 46 ounces in weight.<br /><br />I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces.
656,B002BCD2OG,A1Q1AUJ3E43I8G,purple lotus,1/1,1288656000,excellent sweetner,This sweetner is the best. it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. And it has great health benefts.
675,B000G6MBX2,A2UFC8M91UFRX9,HH h_squared,5/6,1177891200,Who needs salsa when chips taste this good?,These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes. but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful. but not overpoweringly spicy.
705,B000G6MBX2,ACNON4BZACUUL,mommyofchristopher mommyofchristopher,0/0,1217030400,Delicious and additive,Love these chips. and I don't even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus. good for you!
707,B000G6MBX2,A2ZCD6KO2YY9IZ,A. Crawford,0/0,1214265600,Smokin',Nice amount of heat and smoke. Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew.
716,B000G6MBX2,A1AQ2W2R4SOVGN,De Profundis,6/10,1195084800,The Organic Label is Misleading,Yeast Extract is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless. right? Specifically. these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract. which is. on a chemical level. monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source. but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing No MSG while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.
734,B004A8QK98,A2FZE965O64BXJ,Grandma LU,0/1,1342742400,Disappointed!,Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously. I neglected to not look for the word: supreme in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband. guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT. currently Amazon featured the supreme babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future. I will read more carefully.
748,B000Y2EJHY,A7IFA2NZR7YV0,pmen123,1/1,1344902400,The flavor of the gods,If this flavor lasted longer than it does. I'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth.
765,B009HINRX8,A39BLB42U7M6BD,James Brooks,0/0,1344643200,One of the better T-Discs,I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs. and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering. and has a pleasant aroma. Personally. I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However. being a bit mild. it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect. nor is a subscription service available.

807,B0030C9A60,A3BH49ZKESHDID,Fred Camfield,1/1,1290038400,Specialty party item,These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called jello shots. and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups.
819,B003AO5DLO,A228Q0U7S4D88X,Harley Quinn,2/2,1314144000,My dog loves this food!,Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years. and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any people food being added (of course. we still treat her occasionally).  When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment. the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didn't need any cleaning for another 6 months. at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs. and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?
829,B0007NG56I,AN808YPCW2C2F,Chef Victoria,4/5,1333065600,Rave Review for Rolled Oats,Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers.<br />The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest.
833,B001ELL9X6,A298O68DGTCC48,Anthro Mom,9/9,1198022400,Great deal on great tea,My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz. when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned. and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky. like Darjeeling. only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey. it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly. well-sealed. and true to the label -- unlike some loose tea that's actually cut up. this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh.
863,B000VKYKTG,A16V3EN9C3K83W,Sweetiewee,1/1,1308700800,Great product,Bought these for my daughter's Grad party as well as the Strawberry. She loves these things. They're a great product.
875,B000HDMUQ2,AJW40ZXGT8ITY,K. ULLRICH,2/2,1293753600,Something has changed,My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies). but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste. along with their new packaging!!
876,B000HDMUQ2,AGC3K4KSI67RI,Joanne Macek,2/2,1184544000,Good berry flavor,My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness.
883,B000HDMUQ2,A2D293ADQ5HCLF,Blish,0/0,1274832000,small but good,Tasty. convenient bars for people with celiac disease. They seem to have gotten smaller over time. but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size (and the price).
889,B000HDMUQ2,ACSALMTTUS776,Best Busy Boys,0/0,1216166400,Great snack,My son Loves these fruit bars they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars.  My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones... Now my son favors them (chocolate) ones MORE than the berry ones...
891,B000HDMUQ2,A1B1QMGK8VYG80,Dan Seidman,1/3,1308787200,ABSOLUTELY VILE!!!,Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk. perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful. IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store. take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps. if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />Enjoy Life bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.
907,B000ER6YO0,AWBKE3QTB3BWX,Nessie,1/1,1315958400,My baby's favorite 2nd stage food so far and great for constipation!,I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop. which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods. but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated. it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods. so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland. so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus. it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months. sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository. and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein.
914,B000ER6YO0,AB0BXP1IKDBIA,TreGemellini,1/1,1278892800,Runny and odd-tasting,My triplets will not eat this. eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon.

This one is more watery than the others. so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different. so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help.
987,B006F2NYI2,A36GDATSF85X7W,Matt Waz,2/2,1326499200,Awesome Sauce,This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic. habanero. and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce.
997,B006F2NYI2,A3G313KLWDG3PW,kefka82,1/1,1324252800,this sauce is the shiznit,this sauce is so good with just about anything. i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles. it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it
1027,B001E6KBSK,A3R8V9EGMG9PXK,Joyce,0/1,1303084800,LOVE Mueslix,Mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago.  HOWEVER. they have (improved????) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich!  I simply add about half of a grain cereal. such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price.  Stores keep discontinuing Mueslix to the point that it is hard to find!  Thank you Amazon!
1032,B001E6KBSK,A2RURLGD61WYSS,GaryO,0/2,1326067200,Mueslix Cereal,This cereal is the best cereal on the market.  It has many flavors. including nuts. raisins. dates. and especially a light malt flavor.  I have enjoyed it most mornings for years.

1038,B001E6KBSK,A2J1EGNKT7I82I,LLK,0/2,1304899200,Kellogg's Mueslix Cereal,The Kellogg Mueslix Cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. The item was well packed. Contents were fresh. Encountered no problems<br />and plan to use this resource again.
1040,B001E6KBSK,A2HOBQ1UZ2QTSA,Mike stargaazor,5/11,1318723200,Buyer Beware!This product contains High Fructose Corn Syrup!,It's no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health. Unfortunately. it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s. HFCS has replaced regular table sugar. honey. and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body.<br />High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers<br /><br />1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity<br />2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes<br />3. Hypertension and Elevated Bad Cholesterol Levels<br />4.  Long-Term Liver Damage<br />5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS<br /><br />Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees.Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon. Excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat.
1042,B0017SRF52,A1FQ1WQDYAGU77,Jason Walker Jason Walker,0/0,1265068800,Great Stuff,Just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker. wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor. what was surprising was the fact that I knew I had added to much seasoning but it didn't turn out over powering. I would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat. the jerky is great. but the ribs are outstanding. and for 27$ including shipping for 12lbs. awesome deal.
1050,B0018AMWES,A1818NWEJP4RND,MommyInTx4deals,0/0,1334102400,Great color,I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape.
1053,B000CQG862,A3HXPEOW4KN19,Dawn Marakby,2/2,1158278400,Best Tea EVER!!,I ordered the White Christmas. Christmas Eve. and Christmas Morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the Christmas eve.  It's the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor. I use it for iced teas all year round.  I can honestly say that I never got into tea that much until I tried STASH teas.  I sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father. and he called me to ask where I'd gotten it. because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife. too.  Once tried. you will be addicted. Visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles.  These make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies.
1066,B0017ZBPTW,A1YLU9NT0Q9H1V,MJC,0/0,1347580800,Perfect for Espresso,Love this for espressos...the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor.
1076,B0035Q0N0I,A3HPCRD9RX351S,Spudman,2/2,1298160000,Great Ingredients,Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there. but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient. that animal digest. makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food. but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food. for example. is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects. and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs. the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good. but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue. I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.
1119,B0028SWACS,ADLVFFE4VBT8,A. Dent Aragorn,4/4,1304553600,Quality white tea with added unusual flavors,Just in case. if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is. as opposed to green or black. let's quote Wikipedia: white tea is fast-dried. while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing. What does it mean? For me. it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking. white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so. in my view. it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product. while it comes in tea bags. it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas. black. green. herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags. the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped. biodegradable. nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves. not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea. 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong. bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet. green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip'. give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic. fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating.
1121,B0028SWACS,A3M6MZMHTACBVW,R. W. RW,1/2,1247875200,Sublime Fragrance and Taste,If you're looking at Choice tea. you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic. fair trade ingredients for tea.<br /><br />But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design. Lychee White is part of Choice's new line. characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations. this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate.
1129,B003UDSXU8,A1Q3DMETYMY7Q1,Zachary A Wallace,0/0,1348099200,Spicy,This salsa was delicious. It was very spicy as I'm sure you've guessed. but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I don't think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing. you just might end up loving it!

1154,B004134H9W,A2QVVA5EOPBRI5,Richard Aston Graveyard,0/0,1332720000,Mostly dry,I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package. but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher. but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed.
1214,B005O072PC,AWZ1C2FT0L3W9,Sandy,5/6,1156982400,Potatoes,excellent - will order again!!  It's nice to be able to order Omaha items from Amazon because Amazon ships SOOO fast. and payments are so convenient.

1251,B002T62G7S,A1VTIVOTCXO7VO,Tommy,4/5,1294704000,Crab Cakes Delight,Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.
1256,B001FA1L7A,AX9RG05FWB6BD,Barbara A. Bates,11/12,1205452800,Barb,Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.

1291,B000WNJ73Q,A2TIXE6PJOC7X2,M. Evans,0/0,1157587200,Liver Biscotti rules in our house,The ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes.  Our dogs are absolutely crazy for Liver Biscotti.  We love the size of this treat. it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding.  The size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing.<br /><br />We love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used.  All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good. you might be tempted to try one too.<br /><br />We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs. this bag really is a cost saver.  You'll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for your dog loving/owning friends. spread the joy of Liver Biscotti!
1299,B001FA1L7U,A26IDKJAMW7IH8,RICHARD M WING,1/1,1309737600,Mild Sweet And Salty Blend,After a second purchase of a 12-oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6-pack. I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them. this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle-ager. Nonetheless. everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand-alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers. Beer Nuts is a tasty. if understated winner.
1302,B001FA1L7U,ARDU0AO7974KW,G. Swart,1/1,1281225600,Beer Nuts,I am 76 years old and I have eaten these nuts for many years.  The ones mailed to me are very tastey.  The only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can.  No big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts.  I will order from Amazon again.
1323,B004EKO2HE,ABN71P7HPHNB5,LS in RI,1/1,1316044800,Alive and Aware Organic Raw Cacao Powder,This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.

1380,B00068PCTU,A281NPSIMI1C2R,Rebecca of Amazon The Rebecca Review,1/1,1143331200,Also look for the packets,If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea. Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners. Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs. you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia. you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

1392,B00068PCTU,A2W3RO3ZLLX9N9,tropical lady,0/0,1339632000,Best stevia product I've found,After years of using synthetic sweeteners like Equal and Sweet N Low. I realized their long-term effects and wanted to find a good alternative. NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase. it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However. for daily use in beverages. this product is very good.
1400,B00068PCTU,A3UE3WHLZLCMBH,MRC ChickPea,0/0,1319760000,Love this stuff!,I ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. It is not bitter at all and has a very fresh/clean taste to it.  I have baked with it. used it on the stove. and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  When I run out. I'll be ordering more!
1401,B00068PCTU,A37QU23QG5SC48,P. C. Jackson Abba's Girl,0/0,1319414400,The Only Sweetener I Will Use,NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other brands and this one is the best! It hasn't any odd taste. and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.

1449,B003OB2EP6,A2CZQ1ZOSEPPKX,"Arthur Thomas Jesus, John Denver, and Judas ...",3/3,1316995200,The best around,I'm not so sure why the other guy didn't like this so much. I LOVE IT!!  In fact. it might just be one of my favorite foods around.  It's tried and true. rarely cooks wrong. and always good to warm the belly and soul.  I only but this flavor. it's so good. why deviate from it?  I have tried other brands before. bit Maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time.
1451,B003OB2EP6,A2S7HFJI52FBSM,Brenna,0/0,1338249600,Good,Im on a quest to try all the Ramen Flavors. Ramen is a good lunch for me. being easy to make. cheap and versital. The Chicken flavor is one I remember but I havent had it in a long time. its one of the only flavors sold in stores where I live. I made some recently. Its better than I remember. salty but good. This is one of the more americanized flavors. I recommend NOT adding 2 cups of water. I added a bit more than 1 1/4 cup. and it was perfect. 1 1/4- 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 seems to be the perfect amount. I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat. eggs. or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain. Or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings. Whatever you like. This is a great product. I recommend if you want easy. cheap lunches.
1455,B003OB2EP6,A1TXMF6TEP0JVA,Jie Yuan Jie Yuan,2/19,1304467200,not good,the taste isn't good. at least isn't good for Japanese and Chinese.<br />Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste.<br />Plus the price isn't competitive.<br /><br />I'd suggest Asians never buy it.
1459,B0040WHJQM,A1M8Z2N79P7JIG,Sy B,10/10,1288396800,YUM YUM!,I've been eating the McDougall Right Foods for a few years now. and this is by far the best.  It takes exactly the way the name suggests.  It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower. and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me. but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that. I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor.
1500,B002KGN4LE,A2UUIL3VICQQH0,Emily R.,1/1,1310256000,BUY ELSEWHERE,You can find this 6-pack for $40 dollars less at diapers.com.  No reason they should be charging this much.
1534,B000E7WM0K,A23JFATICR3KZ1,Tai Chi,2/2,1165881600,Not bad. but it really is just a taste of thai,Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai. this will give you only half the flavor. so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy. but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal. but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat. you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal. but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket. I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall. my husband and I. being the noodle-mongers that we are. did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However. we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving.
1536,B000E7WM0K,A1KM3ZVOY0PJ3C,Peiwen Liu Bao,1/1,1167350400,artificial flavor,I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare. but when I eat it. I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it.....
1538,B000E7WM0K,A24FTIZ8U0TI6U,Jahnna,1/1,1163116800,Really good!,The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy! The coconut and ginger flavors are very mild.<br /><br />Each recloseable. Chinese-takeout-shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container. One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there weren't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3. plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier. (Of course. one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you're not fond of it. but I like them all!)
1539,B000E7WM0K,ADFYGTU2B7I1R,Lonni W,0/0,1337558400,Not so much...,We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um. Ginger. not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor. and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though. if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here). then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me. though (if I may mix my metaphors).
1541,B000E7WM0K,A1MJV8L3KIDDXD,Carole in OK,0/0,1255996800,Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger soup,I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again.
1556,B000E7WM0U,A35HOUWHAYZZN6,Hedera Femme,3/3,1179619200,tasty and so easy,While the restaurants always do it best. these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use.  fast. and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy. you might use a little less. but for most. it's just right. and for those that like it spicier. you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately. you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier. creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries. and is maybe a little less spicy.
1571,B0009QWTMM,A3MOFX0JORSBIS,Elaine C. Sharpe,0/0,1233619200,Jittery. lacks body,I had high hopes when I ordered this tea. as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately. this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite. a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch. this might be a good choice.
1574,B001CWZXIY,A2V10DEH7G5AY2,C. Bostock,11/11,1271376000,I would give Harmony Farms extra stars if I could!,I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach. and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight. she slept almost all the time. and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods. and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person. they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs. but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it. and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So. I started making their food. and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food. and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again. but I didn't always have time to make their food. And. homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So. I started to research all the natural dog foods out there. compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms. and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food. and when they've switched over. they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater. and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms. she became an eager eater. more happy and outgoing. and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food. which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium. top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf. but. in my opinion. you are buying the best quality food on the market. so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)
1628,B001RVFDOO,AQE0FIFEDOTK7,fellmy,0/0,1317254400,Love them!,Aboulutely love Popchips!I first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in California. I like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.
1631,B001RVFDOO,A1IAM1NQF1CXL7,Lady Di,0/0,1315785600,Don't Defeat the Purpose by Eating Two Bags at Once!,I have to watch my calories. but I tend to not be very successful if the food I eat is tasteless.  I have enjoyed all six flavors of these Popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag.  My favorites are Sour Cream & Onion and the Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors.  In fact. they're so good I just want to keep eating them; and have to resist opening a second bag. because that really defeats the purpose!  I like the variety pack and it's not a bad value.
1646,B001RVFDOO,A194U71OZ5YTLH,K. Kumar,0/0,1304294400,Yummy:),We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with regular fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative.
1649,B001RVFDOO,A2N3GSVCG76JTB,James Luna The Architect,0/0,1303084800,Just my 2 cents...,I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said. Pop Chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Salt & Vinegar by far.<br /><br />The calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair!
1652,B001RVFDOO,AQXYD1H2ZQ9NN,frugalshopper,0/0,1299888000,Love These Chips,The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.
1653,B001RVFDOO,A2MW2W7H1DUOF8,Sven the Educated,0/0,1299801600,tast great less lard.,These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.
1679,B001RVFDOO,AKWTZXXRNFX5G,PB jeanne,0/0,1289779200,Popchips - Love !,I am so happy to try and enjoy pop-chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com. products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious. they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family.

1715,B001RVFDOO,ASEVQDUOGXVFI,jbhill,0/0,1283126400,love this snack,Everyone should try these chips. They are healthier than regular chips. And they taste good.
1724,B001RVFDOO,A1XZ6DZR8UL0EH,R. Adidjaja,0/0,1281052800,Watch out- they are addictive,If you had to choose. my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar. followed by salt and pepper. Suprisingly. the original flavor was my least favorite. probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer. Very tasty chips. healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact. the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! This is a really nice product.
1730,B001RVFDOO,A2OH0EA9PEW4FN,bookgoddess88,0/0,1280534400,Great chips. poor packaging,I order these chips on a regular basis.  If you are doing Weight Watchers. these chips are 2 points a bag.  When this particular shipment arrived at my house. it was poorly packaged.  I received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  This is the 1st time in the four times that I've ordered these. hopefully it won't happen again.

1775,B001RVFDOO,A12WK0RR80JDE7,Ann M. Baker tech mom,0/0,1261353600,Yummy!,I originally found these at a Target out of my home town. I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher's plan. They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty. I could not find them where I live so I purchased them from the Pop Chips web site which took me through Amazon. Yummy!

The individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if I have a craving for a snack.  Thanks for the product. Jean Roth
1815,B001RVFDOO,A2RL1RS6PWUHWI,Jennifer Ackerman,2/2,1336608000,Too strong of flavors,I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say. I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.
1823,B001RVFDOO,A3OJODCRBTTF51,D. Spaulding,0/1,1267574400,Pop Chips. yum!,I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors. then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp. delicious. and taste salty. mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag. and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving. unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds. or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch. no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping. and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour. if you like that type. and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good. just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save. chips delivered to your door. individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!
1843,B001RVFDOO,A3M3CXC2I4JW9T,dab1231,1/1,1319760000,Melts In Your Mouth,I am so happy to have discovered these chips. I hate stealing a phrase from another product. but they melt in your mouth. I have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.Just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag. air popped chips. Do try them people!
1881,B001RVFDOO,A2TNX79ZWHE8EE,shellseeker,0/0,1344556800,Yummy!!!,These were awesome!! They have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling. I bought the variety pack to try all the flavors. Didn't care for the salt and pepper. but loved the rest. Will definitely buy more!
1886,B001RVFDOO,A20BIVDBVVSSGP,MJ Weidenbach merchain,0/0,1338249600,partially good,Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste.
1889,B001RVFDOO,A2S51O1TSXRB3V,Molly  Moo,0/0,1335312000,Snack of the hour!,These are such a treat when you are craving that salty. crunchy snack. And the multi-box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. Share it with son so they don't get stale but not much chance of that.  One of my 3 Points plus Weight Watchers Snacks that I don't run out of!
1895,B001RVFDOO,A1RJUXDK64O91A,Sandy P saprater,0/0,1333843200,Like slightly charred popcorn,I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well. they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However. I just couldn't get over the taste. which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of burnt flavor wasn't there. these might have been more palatable. but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also. the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However. I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall. I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However. I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now. I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers.
1896,B001RVFDOO,A1WO04IW1HFEU1,Juliep,0/0,1333411200,Yummie!,I found these chips originally at a local market.  However. I have been unable to find them since.  WHEW!  what a relief when I was able to locate them.  These chips have so much flavor. they're not greasy and they are crunchy.  I am a chip-a-holic and these are by far the best chips I have ever eaten.
1899,B001RVFDOO,A3FC2U8EPUE6UC,babylou319,0/0,1332547200,overrated,These chips taste so dry and gross. I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories.
1915,B0016PKA1C,A1MPHD8OJTXR1R,A. Marvin,3/3,1266105600,Great concept. poor product,I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept. but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.
1920,B0016PKA1C,A19OAB9Y3GT3SO,Jennifer,1/1,1305072000,Save your money!,I rarely write reviews. but these pods are so awful. I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod. be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do). they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said. just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this!
1921,B0016PKA1C,A3BH4HA3R81GS1,kk,1/1,1303776000,keeps herbs fresh. looks nice--awkward to use,I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch. and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus. but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2 of water with a plastic bag over the top. which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar. however. and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches.
1922,B0016PKA1C,A3SKJR85RGGZG7,goosedude goosedude,1/1,1300665600,Would be a great product....if it was easier to open,I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!
1940,B000F4EU52,AYWPUWMMWS40Y,sue,1/1,1274832000,tropical fruit,I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor.

1954,B001HBTGI8,A20FYL3KJ5KRU5,Louis Galizio,0/0,1298937600,olive juice,I purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices. i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis. i was pretty disappointed. the juice is very strong. i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini. the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice. it was way too salty. the olive juice was over powering. i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1/4 part olive juice. i would not recommend this item.

Whole Grain Mix until I saw all these rave reviews about StoneWall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix. I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.<br /><br />This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix. the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter. which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7 round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However. I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple. etc.<br /><br />In short. I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand. at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach.
2011,B001E5E29A,A36EXMLDJV00JQ,Jon Doeringer,1/1,1303430400,Excellent,I'm sorry not everyone likes this mix. but we love it. It is like going to a gourmet restaurant! (yeah - a gourmet WAFFLE restaurant...) The waffles taste and turn out great. and so easy. Hard for us to believe. but it seems it's not for everyone.
2013,B001E5E29A,APV31N9CR3WLX,Jeannel399,1/1,1299283200,We love Stonewall Kitchen,Stonewall Kitchen products are a big favorite at our house.  This pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat.  We add fresh blueberries to them. and top them with the Stonewall Blueberry Syrup. which you can buy on their website.  They make wonderful jams and jellies too. as well as sauces. and flavored syrups.  Try this pancake mix though. you won't be disappointed!
2039,B001E5E29A,A1J2E7CBMOLNKX,Jasmine Nike Green,0/0,1324166400,yummmmmmmmmm!,we love this pancake / waffle mix.  It's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick.  Crispy. light. tender. yummy!
2052,B001E5E29A,A24RFBVRNZJ9HY,jgr2,0/0,1280016000,Tasty pancakes - best mix we've ever tried...,We are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better!  Sunday is pancake day at our house. and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  This mix holds fresh blueberries nicely - don't over-mix the ingredients and you will get nice. fluffy fruit-filled (or not) pancakes that are absolutely first-rate.
2059,B001E5E29A,A1VK4EB3V76826,M. LIOU,0/0,1271548800,We love it.,No matter how you mess up the recipe. this Mix still makes my family happy in the Sunday morning :)
2065,B001E5E29A,A15C9JJZIFH95R,risky123 risky123,1/2,1315612800,Nothing special for what you pay,Been curious about Stonewall since reading all the Amazon reviews but not sure about spending $$$ for a pancake mix.  The other day. found a big can at Sur La Tab store in San Francisco for only $10.95. so I thought. why not. this is my chance to try.  I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is. underwhelming. nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and healthier butter. it was alright. but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit. added madagascar vanilla. flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes. tasted a bit better. Overall rating. 3 stars. just ok. stuck with the can so we'll eat it. but will not purchase again.  I will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference. it probably does. I highly recommend Garvey's Organic Pancake Mix. also here in Amazon. tastes so much better and fluffier.  If you like 100% whole grain pancakes. we also love Kodiak Buttermilk mix. also here on Amazon...healthy. hearty and so good. even my kids love it...and best of all it's just add water. makes it portable. we even took it with us on vacay to Hawaii.
2075,B001E5E29A,A1FUCVOWVV7NVO,Roger Westfall,0/2,1279756800,Price versus taste don't add up,We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.
2081,B005HGAVGK,A24ZCC8AAHPOUI,Betsy Chapman,3/3,1336953600,VERY Unsatisfied,Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors. got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee. much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes. I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors. I would have ordered such!<br /><br />On the up side. the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise. don't waste your money!
2083,B005HGAVGK,A2PQZHD03LOEKJ,pyrmom,2/2,1332460800,Extremely Disappointing,There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First. the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock. it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.<br />Second. the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive. only 2 were coffees. the remaining 5 were teas.<br />The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today.
2086,B005HGAVGK,A3SS43TTU38Y8T,Rob,1/1,1335312000,Worst Summer EVER,Really Amazon?! Nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of EGG NOG... and when I am not craving Egg Nog in the summer. it's Gingerbread I'd really like... don't buy this. it sucks... I'm probably just going to toss it. If there was the ability to rate this with a negative number... I'd say -3
2087,B005HGAVGK,AXDYJ9U7TD7A3,very disappointed,1/1,1334534400,Not Summer Items!,I do not consider Gingerbread. Spicy Eggnog. Caramel Apple Cider. Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
2097,B007POA176,A830NL2LWO3TV,S. Napolitano holistic health coach,0/0,1338854400,Great new GMO-free snack!,I was very pleased to stumble upon this brand. as it is difficult to find healthy snacks for families that don't contain GMO ingredients. These were a big hit with kids and grown-ups alike; added bonus that they are low in calories and gluten-free. I would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor. as well as the brand in general. Great new company!
2120,B000EGX2E6,A1K4AIPL0NFAGF,Constance Cade,0/0,1316131200,Get's old too quickly!,I first tried these in a bundle of other gluten-free products. and it was so fresh. So I decided to buy it in bulk. and the expiration date was only three months. I ended up given most of it away because I didn't have time to eat all of the 12 packages I received. The taste is ok. not too sweet. but I found myself getting sick of it fast.
2122,B0017OV6LA,A3VP845SOWSCAI,L. Ruth Sr. Sun Lover,0/0,1277769600,Awesome Candy!!,I love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. It has been very hard to find in any stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It still has the same flavor after all of these years. Try this candy if you love coconut. You will love it too!
2134,B004ET9OIW,A1XZBZUY80ZIGP,Sara M.Lee,0/0,1314144000,Fantastic,These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!
2144,B002BB7EWI,A2ESMRG6O3LC2E,kelley,0/0,1321401600,Plum is the best!,Plum products are such a wonderful and yummy idea for the toddler. heck even the adult from time to time. I keep a full stock of every flavor fruit pouch Plum makes for toddlers. They make a great snack to throw in the diaper bag or back pack. whether you are packing a for a trip to the store. school lunches or going to Disneyland! These pouches have saved the day many many times. I have even grabbed one or two to add to my lunch when no other fruit was available for me. and it was really good! I have and will always recommend Plum to every parent I know!
2153,B002BB7EWI,A2R9FU4HOE1QN7,Gary Forbis,0/0,1295913600,My 7 month old daughter and 18month old twin niece and nephew love these,These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.<br /><br />My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product.
2158,B004K6781Y,ANK76360Q8YU2,shortandsweet,0/0,1319846400,These are amazing.,Delicious and nutritious! We live for coconut and nut treats since we don't eat grains. When I want to splurge. I pick up a bag of these from Whole Foods or my local indie health store. They average around $10 here unless they're on sale. :) I'd looove to be able to buy these in bulk. YUM YUM!
2163,B000N5XCPM,A1LPIWKM3RHPJI,Javapie3 Javapie3,2/2,1326412800,My dog love this!,I just switched from Merrick Whole Earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by Merrick and my dog loves it!  This a great for dogs that like human food.
2211,B0007T3V82,A31SZ1KB15I36Z,S. Donius,4/4,1209340800,Nice!,We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
2243,B002C4HZ00,A1JBIWAA81AMZG,Elsie Friedman,5/10,1295568000,Dented cans,Of the 12 cans shipped 11 of them had very. very serious dents in them. I'm not talking dings. I talking serious dents.  So dented that I truly thought of throwing them away.  My husband stopped me though because at $5 a can he felt that it was too wasteful.  In my local grocery store. items this dented are put into a reduced price bin. because they usually don't move otherwise.<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4HZ00>Cento San Marzano Certified Tomatoes. 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

2271,B00182I57O,A20UK2XTOPD27G,Jeffrey Bryan,2/2,1247702400,Extraordinary!,This mild semi-soft/soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that I have yet to find elsewhere.  The price is worth it. though I can't afford to order it often. but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight!
2272,B0016D2MY2,A3M4CJT7SCDBHC,Sylvia Valerio,0/0,1349913600,Amazing! Worth every penny!,This tea is absolutely incredible! Addicted after first taste. So delicious... the smell... the taste... it's a beautiful experience. I just ordered more (and gonna try both regular and decaf).
2274,B0016D2MY2,A3HJVLNBJ6LS6M,D. Gould RunnerGirl825,0/0,1339027200,Delicious tea!,I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.
2275,B0016D2MY2,A2SKIUWJRJX9O6,logophile Avid Reader,0/0,1337990400,Totally delicious,After having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition. I tried many different kinds and favors of tea until I stumbled  upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby. I loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years. The sachets are perfect for a larger mug. the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or mugs. It's a hearty tea that I find satisfying and delicious.
2290,B002MB2J6I,A205R1G2OECHFU,Marj R,1/1,1279929600,The Muffin Tops Are Better,I really like the frozen Corn Muffin Tops. but the mix resulted in a dryer product. I used the paper muffin liners and I think these might have added to the dryness.
2299,B00176AIDU,A3SC3T5GGVLRAS,Kat Freeman,1/1,1329091200,SKIMPY for the price charged!!  Shocked!,Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected. because that's the size I wanted and ordered. but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW. I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok. but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!<br />  Here's the product link at this time:<br /><br />  <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU>Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling. 5-Inch</a><br /><br />  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again Buyer Beware!!<br /><br />UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust. Service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money!! How's that for Customer Care?? :) Great!! Thank you Amazon.com ~~ you are TERRIFIC!!
2309,B0001VWE0M,AQM74O8Z4FMS0,Sunshine,0/0,1127606400,Below standard,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2327,B000E5C1YE,A316CV1WH3U5C5,J. Greene,1/1,1255392000,Exactly what I ordered. plain and simple,If you like SweeTarts and you want them in a bulk amount. this product is for you. The SweeTarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition. There are no downsides.
2331,B000E5C1YE,AIPBPZT9QR9CC,MT CK,1/2,1245196800,great product at a great price,I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great. the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous. way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com
2336,B0001FQVCK,A5D06XJHDXK75,C. Po,1/1,1190592000,Baci's are pure heaven - great gift. stocking stuffer!,My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term Baci Pill for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat. after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!
2337,B0001FQVCK,ALU8PT2XF2OHH,Pamela R. Howell prhluv9,0/0,1247443200,Yum-o,Just returned from Italy and was told these little chocolates were the favs of the Italians--perfect little two-chocolates for gifts -- and gloomy days -- or happy days --
2340,B002SOR6VM,AZN7SJLF2F2IN,Melanie C,1/1,1298851200,Great for an allergy dog,I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn. wheat. potatoes. flax. fish. and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product.
2355,B004VLVK4E,A3UF4K552BJ1VC,Happy Rafters,0/0,1350864000,Yellow split peas,Bought these for a change from the green split peas. They are tasty and I like them. Will buy again. Always like Bob's Red Mill products.
2362,B00637N4H0,A2XL8DUN7C0KGU,cmc,1/1,1325721600,This is THE Verona replacement,Together with many customers. I was frustrated when Tassimo and Starbucks ended their relationship. My coffee was Verona.<br />Since that time. I have tried various alternatives (Gevalia Espresso. Tassimo Carte Noir. Tassimo Nabob & Kenco Med Roast) but with limited and varying degrees of success.<br />After reading a previous review. I sent off for a supply to test it - I love it!!!!<br /><br />I was on the point of giving my Tassimo machine away - no more.<br /><br />A great start to the New Year.
2363,B00637N4H0,A2WKM9BXOC4JH9,I. Bilynsky Info Center,1/1,1324339200,Great coffee. possibly the best for tassimo,I recently got a tassimo machine and really like it. but the initial coffees that I tried were not as good as what I used to make by the pot. This one finally blew everything else away. It's delicious. The dark house blend is now my preferred t-disc when I want coffee. Since I'm not a coffee snob I don't like to get crazy with the adjectives. but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor. Full-bodied is a good way to describe it. as opposed to a lesser-bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it. This is definitely the best coffee I've ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster. It has no aftertaste and it is not bitter. You can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it. or add some cream. Even if you go heavy on the creamer it doesn't lose is flavor. Buy it. and ignore the starbucks haters. Seriously. starbucks' coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be. Dunkin Donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality.
2367,B001LQTDBE,AH1WO4RD371X,P. Graham,3/4,1272931200,Absolutely loved them!!!,These were so. so good. and I love that they're made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute (not aspartame or splenda).  I looked at some Atkins peanut butter cups I'd just bought. and they're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies.  I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat. unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my healthy snacks.  And since I'm over 40. size 4. with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what healthy is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were greasy.  Maybe hers were in the heat. and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!
2391,B0089SPDUW,A1ACXZOUVYS3T5,Brian Dumont,2/2,1342569600,Good Bold Coffee,I've been drinking Green Mountain's Dark Magic and really enjoyed it. however I wanted a change.  After some searching I discovered this coffee and am glad I did.  It's got an excellent deep flavor that I really enjoy.  Strong enough - yet not overpowering.  I recommend you give it a try.
2401,B0089SPDUW,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,Blythe Dresser,1/1,1327104000,Smooth and tasty and an absolute dream come true for those who enjoy bold dark roasts...,Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G>Caribou Coffee. Caribou Blend. K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers. 24-Count</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI>Caribou Coffee. Daybreak Morning Blend. K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers. 24-Count</a>). I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend. on the other hand. prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before. we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark. but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing. I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it. though. and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion. but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.
2408,B0089SPDUW,A1Z20CMOWLJ8I1,rrob4,0/0,1345248000,yum,This is a serious cup of joe. Yummyness!<br />I have turned at least 3 friends onto this coffee.<br />Robust and aeromatic
2434,B0089SPDUW,A3N7T3Q56NR6UG,Peter N. Deweese,0/0,1315958400,Yum,This is a great coffee.  Its dark but not bitter. a little chocolaty. and it reminds me of an Adirondack lodge.  I can get them for a better price in a Caribou Coffee store. however.
2439,B0089SPDUW,A163RZETDROJL5,D. Johnson Dr. Duck,0/0,1303862400,Best K-cup out there.,So Far this is the only K-cup I've found thats tastes great with a normal brew!  It's not watered down like the regular stuff. and dosen't taste burnt like the bold stuff. They only K-cup i'm buying from now on!
2487,B0027IQC5K,A1RKCPYOCFTE0Y,Frieda Bandida,8/8,1265155200,Great food,I feed my dogs Sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food.  I recommend Sojos.<br /><br />But I had a problem with the Amazon purchase.  Amazon stored the Sojos bag in the original mailing box Sojos sent them.  My order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the Sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me.  The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly. but Amazon needs to keep control of the use-by dates of food they offer on their site.
2488,B0027IQC5K,AZTEQJCI6N5WL,Mari Hofman dog lover,2/2,1296172800,GREAT food,I have three Newfoundlands so we go through a lot of food!  One of the dogs has had severe health issues and since we've switched from commercial kibble to home made food. he's thrived!  He gets regular blood tests to monitor the drugs he's on and they have been perfect since we started on Sojos!  It will not cure his issues. but he has more energy and he can't wait for meal time!  The other two are glowing with health as well!  All three dogs coats are shiny and they have tons of energy (for a Newf!)
2491,B0027IQC5K,AVMDL6UUCOO4X,amf111462 adult gamer,0/0,1318377600,picky puppy...,I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder. I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test. I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with. as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula). which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits. since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones. venison antler. lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag. he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements. urinating. drinking water and playing. running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam. which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter. left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air. and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones. etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem. since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well. I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat. but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original. he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days. I would play with and take his food away. so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard. train hard. take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it. but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other. much like us humans.
2500,B000EIE7GQ,A9AR5T9OE95WU,B. Neilly,6/10,1280620800,theres better curry paste out there,this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry. at the time i loved it. made it all the time. then i discovered a better brand of curry paste. hand brand curry paste. premium stuff. amazon doesn't sell :(. hint to amazon. stock it. but you can get it at [...]. its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand. the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy. a huge difference. i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal. very bland. boring by comparison. also as a side note. these are very small containers. i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store. these are like 1/4 the size of those ones. not a good deal if you can find it locally.
2503,B003LKLK3C,A6BNJBC1ZBCIL,Jill,0/0,1296432000,Good quality for a good price.,Previously I bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter. but the mustard I made with this seed is very tasty and (after mellowing a few days) not bitter at all. Pleasantly spicy.

2510,B0079LSXQ6,AKE6DXEN3GWPC,Cyndi Beane Henry Texicanwife,4/4,1332460800,I Want More!,I picked this up at my local grocery store in the seasonal aisle [with the Easter goodies].<br /><br />This moist cake mix can be made with or without eggs. I used them. and wasn't the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />I paired the cake with Pilsbury's Pink Lemonade frosting. too. But you could have it totally un-frosted if you'd like! You will still love it!<br /><br />Perfect for the family dessert. children's cupcakes. or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea! If you love pink lemonade you are going to love this!<br /><br />The color just screams Spring and Easter! And the taste will leave you screaming for another bite!<br /><br />I give this 5-stars and my thumbs up!
2524,B000NY4SZQ,A1IDF30FSGME1L,Shari,2/2,1283040000,Thomy Mustard Maniac,This is the best I've ever eaten.  If you like mustard and you like<br />horseradish this is the product to try.<br />My first experience with Thomy was several years ago when my Son lived<br />in Germany.  He used to send it home. but after he moved back to the<br />States the supply was cut off.  But when you notified me that it was<br />available. I was ecstatic.<br />The blend is delicious. and goes well with your favorite crackers and<br />cheese appetizers or with anything you enjoy with mustard.  It adds<br />that little zing.<br />Give it a try. you won't be sorry.
2539,B000G7UDPY,A1GRTRZHLX81FM,Donal Slentz,1/2,1204761600,Pretty Good,This soup is pretty good. not great! I put some heavy cream (1-2 oz) and some Tabasco in it. I have had a lot better Lobster Bisque - But at a much higher price...

2605,B005BSQ56O,A2G306PM3P5P54,John,0/0,1348617600,Good,Good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. A little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. Overall good coffee
2613,B0016FY6H6,A3I4PCBRENJNG2,L. Cain,4/4,1300579200,lots of uses for this green tea...,lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years. I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings. smoothies. baked goods. etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened.
2621,B0016FY6H6,A1U15WYNFC412O,Art Denning,2/2,1288051200,Good tea,This is good iced tea. It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
2622,B0016FY6H6,A1OTXOGDLHTYSR,M. Whitehead,2/2,1286841600,Stash Green Tea Powder,This is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea! I add lemon juice and stevia.
2625,B0016FY6H6,A2IOH181X1SZ3S,A. Dapice,2/2,1270166400,Great for on the go!  Makes water a little less boring!,I think this is a great green tea powder.  I add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste. I prefer it unsweeted so that I may add a sweetner if needed.  Great price for the quantity and the quality of the product.
2628,B0016FY6H6,A2B0RUYD25KBFB,H. Hill,1/1,1314403200,Good tea taste. not sweet,This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry. but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally. the color of the tea is actually green. not yellow. like many Chinese varieties. Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well.
2647,B0016FY6H6,A2NLZ3M0OJV9NX,Mark Bodzin,0/0,1313107200,way too weak for my tastes,What can i say. I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it. and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products. or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties.  (when i say i drink iced tea. i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me). and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.
2656,B0016FY6H6,A1U15WYNFC412O,Art Denning,0/0,1288051200,Good stuff,This is good iced tea.  It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
2659,B0016FY6H6,A14U2WTVE7B377,bunny,0/0,1280361600,Very refreshing!,Just the right amount of blueberry flavor. and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners. and really does not need them.<br />This is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well!
2662,B0016FY6H6,A34OXX5PQ1XEHB,va212atr,0/0,1275177600,Powdered Green Tea by Stash,Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. Simply pour in water bottle. shake and be on your way.<br /><br />Product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. Much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on Amazon.
2706,B003NDA970,A1KHOI0WVQRI2J,Matthew Brown mwbrown,20/20,1151539200,Great Popcorn,I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like yellow popcorn. I don't like microwave popcorn. I like the white popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my popping style the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said.
2726,B003NDA970,A4T1ZBS2ZMOPC,Patricia J. Wicker DVD connoisseur,1/1,1308528000,Very good popocorn,My doctor told me I must eat hulless popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack. I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny. but they pop well. although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great. however. and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless.but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore.
2733,B003NDA970,A39KH7TSRC0K04,Misha King Afritalian,0/0,1350777600,Great little mini popcorn!,I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago. which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how gourmet popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND. normal popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But. I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil. sea salt. black pepper. and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn. and they're all good. This is my favorite. though!
2748,B003NDA970,A1UEK9HPGME6GE,Sally Anderson,0/0,1268006400,Best Popcorn Ever,I bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends. The have commented back several times that it's the best popcorn they have ever had. They love it!  They had shopped in the DC metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on Amazon was all it took to find this -- the best popcorn ever!!
2749,B003NDA970,AUXGA0GCHRI7X,Rebecca B. Jones,0/0,1264809600,Microwave Popcorn,I bought this for my daughter's new microwave popcorn popper as a Christmas gift. and she says that it is delicious. but pops up smaller than other popcorn.  She likes it a lot.
2750,B003NDA970,A1UP81S8OCJASL,A. Dominguez A.,0/0,1264377600,wonderful,This is very high qulity pop corn. I recomend it.  Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop.  Very healthy and yummy!
2764,B003NDA970,APV35AMLRGQCW,A. Sanchez,1/2,1278288000,Popcorn was alright,The Popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper. I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped. there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results.
2768,B003NDA970,A2AFK8D674G3MG,Texas Grandma,1/2,1235260800,Delicious Popcorn,This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  jump out before popping.  Great flavor. great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks.

2812,B003JH91RO,A2VHO3LINCOL62,S. Perry suziquep,0/0,1272758400,a favorite,This is a new treat for our kids. They are pretty picky eaters. especially my girl! They both love 'em. Glad I found this product. Reasonably priced too
2823,B0085G4ACA,A22HYNTJXQHP25,mariexpx,1/1,1312416000,Best tasting coconut water I have found!,I have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry. and this is. by far. my favorite.  The pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa. I also like the tetra pack with the screw on top- it is much more convenient than the smaller 11 oz size which you cannot reseal.  This has been a great Gatorade substitute for me. and helps a lot when I am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly. Great stuff!
2842,B0085G4ACA,A8A616OW1Q9M5,Vito Wagner,0/0,1334793600,Best coconut water flavor and size,I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink. it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.<br />The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes. because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.<br />As with all coconut waters. the taste can vary slightly. but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant.
2848,B0085G4ACA,A1Z3XWG2W5GOHP,Nite Runner,0/0,1323648000,delicious!!!,I love buying these and drinking them after my workout.  You lose not just fluids but minerals/vitamins and this helps replenish you.  Water is good too for you too but I just love these post-workout.  They are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink (like you don't want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing).
2855,B0085G4ACA,AW70V7K6Y06JY,Turiya O,0/0,1258243200,Delicious and Rejuvenating,Great before. during. and after a workout. Great natural electrolytes. Very high in potassium. amazing drink! This is my favorite flavor. tangerine is 2nd
2856,B0085G4ACA,A2TPR6CK4KGRP6,B. Teixeira,0/0,1254787200,great taste. nice fruit flavor. serve chilled,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.  You can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
2883,B007OXJLM4,A1VGXHHR08G044,FlyingPolarBear,0/0,1323216000,Green Mountain compared with Tully's French Roast,Out of curiosity I compared with side-by-side with Tully's French Roast k-cups.  These Green Mountain k-cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of Tully's.  Both k-cups are good. but if you're going after a French Roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then I'd recommend Tully's French Roast k-cups.
2897,B000F9Z1WI,A2NJO6YE954DBH,Lawrance M. Bernabo,2/2,1156464000,Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack,We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie. which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the Oreo Biscuit).  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine. but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the modern Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped. which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for hill). with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the cream in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white. as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling. not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate. coffee and cream. peanut butter and chocolate. etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that. or with white chocolate fudge in winter. and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all. once they are open they could go stale. and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo. which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos. bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks. almost 20 to a pack. that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now. I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer. so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream. but they are lighter in taste than that. even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs. to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat. 2 grams of fat. and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g.. 56: Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees).  Of course. I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream. but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

2942,B0002TJAZK,A3U39114B8DDPR,Patricia Malek Chicago fanatic,1/2,1301356800,She Loves It,This is the perfect food for my cat & in fact. the only one she will eat - wet or dry.
2943,B0002TJAZK,A2ISKAWUPGGOLZ,M. S. Handley,2/4,1310774400,Kitty Junk Food,We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years. the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet. but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats. and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time. we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest. so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago. all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl. like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor. although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands. such as innova or royal canin. there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain. as well as the other problems we noted. we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

It's so much better than the food court. and I have much better regulation of my nutrient intake. Finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task. Tuna is excellent and these little Chicken of the Sea White Tuna Cups fill the bill. Put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts. It's good nutrition. and there's no worry about weight gain. Also. when I'm camping. I like to take a batch of these tuna cups along. In both cases. the cup size just the right for one serving.<br /><br />I had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups. and it might be just a batch problem. My latest tuna was very dry. I almost had to choke it down. And it seemed rather tasteless. I've had these cups in the past and they seemed much better. I have not been satisfied with the present ones. However. I like the product and the serving size and It will not deter me from future purchases.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a maternity ward for our alpaca millay and her new cria.

3034,B0052OI128,A2R6RA8FRBS608,Matthew G. Sherwin,2/2,1348185600,WhoNu? Chocolate Sandwich Creme Cookies ~~ DELICIOUS AND HEALTHIER THAN THE MAJOR NAME BRAND !!!,These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you. True. they have almost the same sugar. fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!<br /><br />They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.<br /><br />Overall. these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent. healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie.<br /><br />I love `em! Enjoy!
3035,B0052OI128,A253T7ELJ0N64S,Lia M.,2/3,1314489600,SO delicious!,I bought these locally. not from amazon. I'm in Arizona and they are sold in Albertsons and Bashas stores. They are absolutely delicious and taste just like other cookies. I bought all four of the flavors to test them out. The only one I didn't like was the chewy chocolate chip. All others though are wonderful. I count calories and try to eat healthy. but I do indulge with treats sometimes. This is the perfect treat since it has all the vitamins and fiber! I will never eat a regular cookie again. What's the point when you can actually get nutrition from tasty cookies!?
3037,B0052OI128,A256JOUD8X0J7R,musicfan The 80s are my favorite,0/0,1343865600,Okay,I really liked these cookies when they first came out.  But then I got a little tired of them.  They have a bit of a gritty texture. and they don't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving. but I can't eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesn't agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils. just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it. it leaves a thick. greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings. cookies. cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling. and I don't like it at all.  Some are worse than others. making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well. but I'm guessing it is less because they don't bother me.  I like them much better.  It's weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu. the vanilla wins for me.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie. and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos don't taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients. and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesn't seem to be very different.  Actually. the difference in sodium doesn't seem very significant. either.  I decided I'd rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.  It's something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons.
3047,B004NNFEA6,AMRMK86X3PKXD,R. Thomasson,5/5,1310515200,Snyder's Best Flavor,I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say. that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good. but spectacularly good! They have a very rich. buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting.
3050,B004NNFEA6,A2S1SXQV908O51,Kim,0/1,1337385600,Great,My daughter loves these snacks and can't get them in China where she is working now so I ordered them for her. Very satisfied and she was very appreciative.
3060,B002SWR5VK,A2E4NXOR0CX3LG,Knite,1/1,1282003200,Excellent!,This is amongst the best Karachi Halwa I have eaten. Not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones...just perfect.. individually wrapped pieces in the box.
3077,B000FDKQCO,A2X6T9WBNADH22,SGJ SGJ,1/1,1174521600,good healthy dessert but needs work,These brownies are good. but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it. I added a little whole wheat flour. splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!).
3105,B004W8LIBQ,AIGB0Z9ZN83RC,tina guyette,0/0,1330905600,dog treats,Dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs.  But it is really a great product.
3114,B004JQVASM,AG6JWI77UMETS,Kenpo-Jujitsu Teacher Phil,3/4,1311811200,Nice alternative to regular coffee...,My wife and I tried this product a few days ago. We were not disappointed. The coffee had a good flavor. and the low acid was a nice added benefit.
3129,B000FDKQCY,A3SH0RNRLX9CP9,J. Smith,2/2,1275696000,Good Back to the Basics bread,Since I started making Hodgson Wholesome Potato bread. my husband will not eat store bought bread anymore!  We make about two loaves a week. in different varieties of the Hodgson Mill brand.  The honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also great.<br />I like using my old bread machine to make the dough. then shape into loaf and bake in the oven.  Makes perfect loaf every time. also makes delicious rolls.<br />Glad I discovered this brand of bread mixes on Amazon--they are wholesome. and I know what I'm putting into the bread I bake now.  Great product!
3137,B000FDKQCY,A1SVHXFN0WZYMK,Tammy37388,0/0,1350172800,My Fave Hodgson Mill Bread Mix!,I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor. great texture. well worth the price! I have bought this a few times on Amazon and will continue to do so!
3139,B000FDKQCY,AJONKNXE84S55,Lorraine Wright,0/0,1327968000,What a Great Product,I just got my Bread Machine for Christmas. so being a novice I thought I would try to Keep It Simple :)  The Hodgson Mill Products are wonderful.  Everything is included even the yeast.  The Bread came out delicious. it was easy to slice.  It is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread.  My family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well. If you try this I think you will be happy with it
3141,B000FDKQCY,A3F6Y22G5MS9M0,Calliopia,0/0,1320710400,Nice bread,I like this bread. and several other flavors in this brand.  This one and the seven grain are my favorites.  They bake consistently well in my Wolfgang Puck machine.  Recommended!
3144,B000FDKQCY,ATDIMAXQYWJTC,Timrrrr1401,0/0,1296950400,Great. easy homemade bread,The potato bread was easy to mix. rises well in my breadmaker. cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty. The bread has a near white bread texture. and was very good. I purchased all of the Hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites.
3154,B003OZYUEA,A6OLGXCVNLN3,Ms Jenna Ms Jenna,5/5,1314748800,Great water!,This water is delicious. I'm not picky. but I can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. And at 50 cents per bottle. delivered to your door. it's a great price. I have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it's a-okay with me. Better than drinking a coke.
3186,B000FDKUSO,A18GKCC69KPR51,Norman Girard,5/7,1178928000,Better than expected,I live on salt and as a result have hypertension. These products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible. keep you alive longer. And. that is a scientific fact. as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions. Keep caring about us and don't stop producing foods that are very healthy.
3194,B000LKXQ32,A2TKKLZTJV4NLV,A. Fisher,2/2,1270166400,The very best organic green tea!!,I have tried many different brands of green tea. and this one is. by far. the best one that I have ever tried! The taste is so delicious and each tea bag is tightly sealed in its own special packet. which keeps it totally fresh until you use it. Even the strings are totally natural. with no metal at all. which can affect the taste of the tea. This is my new favorite tea. and I am so glad that I discovered it!
3199,B001YJ6M7Q,A2WKQ9LUO7IRBE,R. Greenhouse,0/0,1296432000,Size of can seemed bigger,I guess I thought of this can as being the usual commercial 10 can. so the Price of about $16 a can did not seem too bad. but when they arrived I saw that these were somewhat smaller.  They are less than a half gallon.  I don't see the size as that much of a problem. All I have to do is rethink how I would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase. but if I saw that size can in a store I would not pay $16.00 for 51 oz. can.<br /><br />I would have to see what fresh clams would cost first.  I would like if they made the clams bigger chunks. but I could buy some fresh to add to it.  Most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what Snow makes.<br /><br />Good product despite the price!
3223,B005K4Q1VI,A3OCCDTAMODER1,Joe,0/0,1345680000,highly recommended hot chocolate,They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside. the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also. kids may not like the peppermint flavor.... But that is my favorite one. If you don't want to get the variety pack. they sell the individual flavors too.
3224,B005K4Q1VI,AGLWD7FVS8E1L,BasicTek Tim,0/0,1345507200,Best Keurig Hot Chocolate so far,I brew the 8 oz cups. 10 and 12 makes it too thin. It's good at that point but adding some creamer. whipped cream. and or cinamin always improves it.
3231,B005K4Q1VI,A3PFGKHWB839TI,Matt,0/0,1343520000,Great product. great price ...,Great option for excellent taste. price. and convenience. A repeat customer on these! We order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store.

3251,B005K4Q1VI,A1NEGY709BBIY3,Ellen R. Powers etpowers98,0/0,1336089600,Best hot chocolate,So far Grove Square has the best hot chocolate K-cups.  We have tried a couple others but they don't compare.
3277,B005K4Q1VI,A3Z435GQN9XG8,Jo,0/0,1331251200,Very good hot chocolate.,I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned. when I read some of the reviews. that I would not like it but I like it alot.  To me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet.  I would recommend this product.
3283,B005K4Q1VI,A1VABJOP02YUJG,amazonnut,0/0,1330819200,amazon nut,I've been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it's one of the best I've had.  I even got my in-laws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it!  Great price. great product!
3294,B005K4Q1VI,A3LXOMANBRFQJG,suaimhneas15,0/0,1329350400,Too watery after multiple settings.,A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting. took a sip. and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more.

We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite. very good even on the large cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one. on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar. I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
3312,B005K4Q1VI,A1KNF8V0TT4LW2,W. Hoyt Pee Wee Shooter,10/10,1319587200,Rich. thick cocoa.  Surprisingly good!,Ordered on a whim.  My first Grove Square purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee. so far so good.  Great cup of dark. rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity. and lack of clean up. make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save.
3313,B005K4Q1VI,A1MVN7BGX0CYKD,L. Silver amazonophile,7/7,1319155200,Pleasantly surprised,My box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa arrived today and I've just tried it. Delicious. Made a big cup [by mistake] but I'm happy with the flavor and consistency.  No off tastes that I can discern.  A little disappointed at high sodium content. Nice to have as fall starts to chill.
3321,B005K4Q1VI,A12NJLAHKB8DVM,Trudy Myers,0/0,1328140800,Yummy!,The thing I like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once I remove it from the keurig. it doesn't leak all over the place.  For some reason. all the hot chocolates I've purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot.  My coffee doesn't do that so not sure why that is.  This is a great deal for the amount you get as well. and taste yummy!
3322,B005K4Q1VI,AW9KV1KKSBOY7,Deidra Nickerson Crazy about Books,0/0,1327968000,Best Ever,I found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best I've had for my Keurig.  I will continue to order this particular brand.
3329,B005K4Q1VI,A32Q1A49UMZF8Z,Michael Edwards,0/0,1327708800,Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best.,Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best K-cup hot chocolate. I read many reviews before making this purchase. and now I agree. and will continue to buy this brand.
3331,B005K4Q1VI,A22IQ8J47JT0D1,Elizabeth,0/0,1327449600,Tastes off,This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better. or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better.
3341,B005K4Q1VI,A1H4IVXNXWWBLV,chileheadcraig,0/0,1327017600,Good flavor and wont break the bank,Of the few Hot Cocoa flavors we've tried. this is the best so far.  It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k-cups right now.  I thought that the k-cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year. but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced.
3354,B005K4Q1VI,AA1L8TO0LAHX9,Nece,0/0,1326585600,YUM!,Grove Square Milk Chocolate Cocoa k cups are great! I usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. I thought this was easier and delicious. To add creaminess I put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect!
3360,B005K4Q1VI,A3FVY4ZANE3F02,S. Haas,0/0,1326326400,Very good Hot Chocolate,I bought a box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa because I love their Cappuccino French Vanilla.  I used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream...it was to die for.  Very yummy and almost as good as homemade.  I never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews. but it could be because of the Redi Whip I added to it.  I highly recommend it.
3366,B005K4Q1VI,A34FBJHPXI559Z,Susanna Rey,0/0,1326153600,Finally a good k cup hot chocolate!,I have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet!  Very nice flavor. doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates.  very impressed!
3369,B005K4Q1VI,A1SK9O1C7KOLMH,Thomas A. Juarez Tom,0/0,1326067200,Great!,I bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa. but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one.  The peppermint was pretty good as well...good cocoa!!!
3393,B005K4Q1VI,AF3ZIGIYXZUMH,K. Te Gadget lover,0/0,1323820800,You get what you paid for,Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho. in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing.
3401,B005K4Q1VI,AAPW5YIE2JSYE,Sarah B.,0/0,1323043200,Yummy!,It's a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version. No mess and the S&S price is great! I like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser.

3455,B005K4Q1VI,A2BZN96W6QP6XH,mathew lothian,0/2,1323820800,not quality at all,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.<br />NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
3459,B005K4Q1VI,ACR6QJNQON47X,CB123,3/3,1324339200,Delish,My whole family loves this product. often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have (some members of my family have severe nut allergies).  This product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are.
3487,B005K4Q1VI,A2HL2BY512HTVQ,Starsy,1/1,1330646400,Gave it a try. but not as good,Thought I'd try these because it's a good price. but the chocolate flavor is not that good. And the sucralose taste is very strong. I like the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate ones better. even though those have sucralose too. you can't really taste it.
3520,B005K4Q1VI,A2E65ZXD654761,Barbara L,0/0,1351036800,Great tasting,The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve. No major cleanup to deal with either. Highly recommended!
3538,B000YPKODY,A1AD4JN43A4PQN,Lesley,1/1,1319328000,great item,Bought these to give out as party favors for my son's baseball themed birthday party.  They were a huge hit with both the adults and children.
3543,B000YPKODY,A1QY95B93MAV2G,Tiffany,0/0,1335657600,Was perfect,I ordered this product for a themed baby shower. They went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks. Loved that I could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags.

3563,B0092XAMDQ,AM0VRGASSST2K,Ashley,1/1,1346976000,More for Me,This coffee is really rich. perfect in the morning. I ordered it for the office. but it was going fast. After a day or so I decided it was too good/fine to share so I swapped it out w/some cheap stuff and brought it home. More for me!
3572,B0014DZQMO,AAUICTIUBVU7R,Roy Berger Everyman,1/1,1283472000,GREAT SERVICE. DELICIOUS CANDY,I ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light. I live on the west coast and this seller is in CA. so I got the Snickers in just a couple of days. instead of 10.<br />And their shipping costs were less. they shipped via post for under $5. instead of via UPS.<br />Lowest price I have paid for this candy and best quality.

3598,B001QEF4XC,A2Q0JENK8FFCLB,drbearkat,1/1,1344556800,Fantastic dog food - best price - great quality!,This is the best dog food I have ever purchased. and having been a dog training for over 4 years. I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family. and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog. health can be an issue. and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers. and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog. a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues. was switched over when we discovered this brand. and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding. but actual balding from hair loss). but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old. and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater. but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him. and all future pets. on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say Natural on it. the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?
3602,B001QEF4XC,AKWL212NZLW3V,Gary Michael Adams Duke Lacrosse,1/1,1328054400,Good Food,I ordered two of these bags for my three dogs - a mastiff. a lab. and a terrier mutt.  They arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes.  The dogs like the food. their coats are shiny. and the mastiff didn't vomit when beginning this new food.  He has problems when switching foods. but he started on the Diamond Naturals with no problems.  I'm going to continue to buy this food for my dogs.
3603,B001QEF4XC,A174MYJWTXAHQT,LAKeeley lax23dmb,0/0,1349395200,Dogs love it. Wallet love it. I love it,I have 3 dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones I can afford.<br />My oldest (14) loves the lamb. my husky loves the glucosamine and the youngest farts less on this food which makes everyone happy.<br />I always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods. I thoroughly recommend it!
3623,B000R1BPOC,A1FJ2BRJA35DNB,Donald Gregory,0/2,1198108800,Lazzaroni Tin,A little more money than your average cookie. but VERY much worth it.  You will not find a cookie like this anywhere else!
3640,B005RF029M,A2BSA73GSG0UFN,Tonefish Blues ROCKS,1/1,1340755200,Pizza Napoletana Dough Flour ..... Mangia!!,So this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana.  I'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the USA.  This flour makes the most silky smooth dough I've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with. and it has a different (better for pizza) taste than the all-purpose store brand flour.  Sure It costs a little more. it's coming from Italy. but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag ... who's counting?  Get this stuff. some D.O.P. tomatoes. grow some basil. and make some Mozarella (okay. I admit. haven't done this one ... yet) but given the first couple items there and you're well on your way to the origins of pizza in Naples. Italy. Is it worth it??? I say Si!!! Mangia!!! (And Taylor's Market always comes through for my home shipments!... Cheers!)
3652,B002LO0TUE,A30BNNI1U9FCIV,LQQK no more,1/1,1308960000,Cute item!,Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog.  The dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose.  Not sure. but it appears to have a very salty. brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses.  However. it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over. along with their master!
3677,B000FDKQC4,AH464UPNU7MV,Jade Wyatt,0/0,1290384000,Probably would be better to make something like this from scratch,I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense.<br />If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix. you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.<br />In conclusion. I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing.
3682,B000G33MVK,A2LZKUARB5Y8C2,Phlogiston,0/0,1168300800,Woeber's makes a great product.,This is a nice mustard for sandwiches. potato salad. corned beef. roast beef or hot dogs.  I have yet to find a single Woeber product that I do not like.  They are all tasty.  I am glad to see that their distribution range has grown over the past ten years.
3690,B000ER1DIM,A14I86SK59DIX,ginabi,0/0,1327190400,organic honey grahams,I bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. They like them.but not as well as the cinnamon ones. I tried them.thought they tasted kind of like dirt.
3691,B000ER1DIM,A14I86SK59DIX,ginabi,0/0,1327190400,organic graham crackers,Bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. I love them because they are organic. Only the best for my little guys. My big guys even snack on them.
3744,B00016UX0K,A2B1MKGF9XHW7M,J. Ingersoll Fred Schwartz,5/6,1260835200,Thai Chili Sauce,This sauce is good. but for my tastes it isn't hot enough.  I have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered.  This sauce seems to ahve one layer.
3749,B00016UX0K,A1KIZW42HCCMN0,Faith,2/2,1291766400,Really good sauce,I made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce.  It was great.  I love the fact that it doesn't have MSG in it.  It has the right amount of sweetness.  It is a little spicy. but just the right amount.
3757,B00016UX0K,AI6FTXD65U3ZH,Dave Dave,1/1,1284854400,the ultimate sweet and sour sauce,as mentioned...give this a try!  instant party food. frozen meatballs and this sauce... great on chicken. you name it...anything party/snack/happy hour food that you put sauce on would work with this.<br /><br />however the prices from some of the vendors OBSCENE.  $19 for 2 25oz bottles??  This stuff is $1.50-1.75 for the 10oz bottle at any asian grocery....
3758,B00016UX0K,A8PT69KR65EEE,John Gray,0/0,1350691200,Really different - Really good,What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews. soups. etc. It keeps well - the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1. Heinz 57. Worcestershire Sauce. Catsup. etc as a condiment staple.
3764,B00016UX0K,A2F2O2GD72D8ZR,R. Wells AZPHATMAN,0/0,1320451200,This is the stuff you want.,This is the best Sweet Chili sauce I have found anywhere. Some say its to sweet but hey. it's a Sweet Chili sauce and its supposed to be sweet. It has a rich full flavor that everyone in my family likes. Even my wife who can't stand anything anyone would consider hot just loves this sauce. I'm a pepper head myself. If you're like me and like a little more kick try adding some Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to this and you will learn to love it too.
3769,B00016UX0K,A282HEAKK1Y2JH,Cobra,0/0,1306454400,Mae Ploy Chili Sauce,I go to my mothers home one day she cooked fried chicken and rice. I taste the chicken. it is good! That was the day I was introduced to Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce. This sauce is Excellent being sweet and mild hot. will not burn your mouth or give heart burn. I will continue to purchase this product chicken. fish. and other foods are more tasteful. Try it because it is Good!
3785,B00016UX0K,A3E3YJO2V3YZUM,Lidgemeister,2/15,1295481600,Guess I'm in the Minority,I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews. I took a chance.  Well. no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.
3801,B001L1DYAA,A1KX2MDNNDF4C9,Dennis S. Kinsey,1/3,1237507200,Gevalia is the best,Gevalia Kaffee is by FAR the best coffee on the market.<br />Especially the Coastarican peaberry and the Peruvian organic.
3808,B000X2CWTM,A12M1VOU8S1DRN,J. EDSALL,5/5,1264550400,EXCELLENT.TASTY. CHEWY.,THESE CHEWS ARE TASTY AND CHEWY. THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT FOR WHAT YOU GET. WE HAVE PLENTY AROUND FOR OURSELVES AND TO SHARE WITH FAMILY. GREAT TREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS.<br />PLUS THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU WITH NO ADDED JUNK. JUST LICORICE.<br />GREAT BUY. GREAT TASTE.
3812,B000X2CWTM,A60ATYEZM715O,J. Oswald,4/4,1283385600,Close to perfect,this black licorice has great flavor and texture. Some are too soft and too sweet for me. Personal preference I'm sure. but I like this because it's slightly firm (not hard but not soft) and the sweetness is just right. Love that it's only 4 ingredients: molasses. wheat flour. licorice extract and aniseed oil. Price is good too. Compares to Tire Tread Licorice which is my first choice but I can't find it.
3820,B000X2CWTM,AFGWEW525UBN7,michlhw,2/2,1323561600,good traditional licorice,love it. eating it has got to be a ritual. taste is well balanced. nice and chewy without being overly sticky. leave a great lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />compared to gimbal's scottish dogs. these taste and feel more traditional. and much healthier too. given that only four ingredients go into them.<br /><br />out in the midwest. ann abor to be specific. i found these in the candy aisle for around $2.80 per resealable bag of 170g.
3824,B000X2CWTM,A1EM45XKGU0P32,K. Foley,2/2,1211846400,Taste like ...,The Panda black licorice is an excellent product.  The raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses.  This is fine if you value an all natural product. but it is not what I expected.  The two flavors that I bought have all been consumed so they tasted good.
3875,B004A85G52,A1JX59EIBYYQY1,Beachbunny,0/0,1350691200,missing in action,Though London Fruit and Herb Company's Blueberry Bliss tea is one of the best teas I have ever had I cannot understand why Amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago! It IS now available through other Vendors (i.e. Wendell Tea Company in MA) but not at the Amazon price.  If is's available to them it should be available to Amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering.<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A85G52>London Fruit & Herb Company Blueberry Bliss Tea. 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a>

3887,B000GEVGXA,A2W3D8MO3DD9CB,A. Thompson,5/5,1263168000,Truffle Oil? Well. at least the oil is real.,I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called Hocus-Pocus. and a Beaker of Truffles. Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere. you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes...
3889,B000GEVGXA,A2EIME8AT3U9AR,Ruth Briscoe Uneek,2/3,1232409600,Yummers!,This black truffle oil from Italy is fabulous.  It's strong and subtle at the same time.  It's the best deal for exceptional flavor.
3901,B000CC9V42,AJWZZS2JYALNC,Jeremy M. Crawford,1/1,1202428800,Great Kit at a great price. but the wood holder not so good,This is a cool kit for gifts. or a great price on a kit of Dave's Sauce if you use it at home.  A good variety.  My only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all. they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box.  I would buy again.
3922,B002F8E47K,ARTNXU0TK1AG8,Blondie,0/0,1336089600,Better than expected!,I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and/or quality. but after having been consuming this for a couple days. I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross. but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it. and has a kind of nutty taste. Great shipping. great quality. amazing nprice. and I def. rec!
3925,B000VSDFRG,A94U6J9DNX1FF,Dennis de Ramos,2/2,1316390400,Fast Delivery - Item as described.,This candy is amazing!  Great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free.  I wish it was for sale locally. but am happy I get a chance to purchase online.
3942,B001L1KH6Y,A1MO0N4R8UZ9KG,James,0/0,1340323200,One of the best coffees I've ever had,This coffee is splendid. I can't say much more. Perfect smoothness. not at all bitter.. just the perfect dark coffee.
3946,B001FZR732,A34DFPYG46EYJJ,T. Michael Mcgovern,1/1,1293321600,NUTTY,THE NUTS WERE FRESH. THE CONTAINER WAS FINE FOR THE PRICE. BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY THAT I ORDERED THE FREIGHT WAS MARGINAL.
3961,B005HO0ARM,A3NSSVF2VBNT36,Kathleen M. Frantz tuespm449,0/0,1350518400,pleased,I just started using this product so I think it is too soon to rate; however. the order arrived very quickly.
3992,B00110FN28,A134GOSQB3RDRK,valentine,1/1,1221696000,Great for school lunches,I was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly.  It helped that my 7 year old loves Chips Ahoy. but for convenience alone. this was a great purchase since I have free shipping through Amazon Prime.
4000,B00110FN28,A1EC7K3IPS639A,Annie R infoholic,0/0,1240790400,Good store bought cookies,I really like the crunchy chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and. I think. gross.  These have good flavor and are great for trips (although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop!) and especially for preschooler snacks.
4023,B000UZVPKO,A29313797NGT9L,Eddie Wannabee,3/4,1252713600,I like these!,4.5. Just water and large pieces of sardines. Open for all types of combinations of which I find the old whole grain crackers. quality cheese. a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea. the most appealing. They do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well. Solid product. Even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby. Sardines are good for a person. everyone agrees on that. Even a Sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes (the better the bread the better the sandwich...) so yes. 4 Solid Stars and I am hungry for the product right now. come to think of it!
4035,B00115KS8M,A3PPGYCSQXK1GI,Bart A. Smith,1/1,1280188800,Packaged Red Wheat Seeds,I was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores... and this is not just for me! I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors. deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it. and we are now enjoying a strong. healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats. their energy levels are better. and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies. then get this very nice product. The shipping is fast and it is packaged well. The cans are sealed well with a tight-fitting lid. Yes. I am going to continue ordering from this vendor again. They have exactly what I am looking for.
4039,B000CMHMUC,A2ZNC6RKT720P6,Blonde Geek,1/1,1250208000,I Love Soy Crisps,I love light crispy salty snacks. and Soy Crisps is the best one of those I've found.  At only 100 calories per serving/350 calories for the bag. you could literally eat the entire bag (which I do on a regular basis) and not feel bad about it.<br /><br />There are several flavors but Deep Sea Salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy.<br /><br />So delish!  Shipped fast with all crisps in tact.  Great purchase. re-ordering.
4045,B000CMHMUC,A2N9HGZNY042FY,no,0/0,1312848000,too good to be healthy,Stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness I can still get them!!!!<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMHMUC>Genisoy Soy Crisps. Deep Sea Salted. 3.85-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>
4047,B000CMHMUC,A1ZG9SJ5BTZJ5W,pretz pretz,0/0,1271289600,soy crisps = AWESOME snack !,These soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking. With 7 grams of protein in each serving. they are SO much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods.They have a great flavor. just enough salt. and leave you feeling satisfied -nutritionally and snackwise ! My grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking. I highly recommend them.
4054,B000CMHMUC,A1HR1MREZ5MRHB,M. L. Dupuy,0/1,1327104000,Terrible!,I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat. and even snack. healthier.  These had so many good reviews. so I decided to try them.  I admit. it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them. they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.<br /><br />Luckily. I have a niece that is newly vegetarian. hungry all the time. and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!
4086,B001EW5YQS,A2V576O8N1GROI,Roejen,1/1,1325289600,Decent price for a good product,Works fine for my Podcasting needs. I use it with a sure SM58 microphone. It is made of plastic and does feel cheap but I have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it. For desktop use it should be fine. Works great for my needs. Wouldn't recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around.
4090,B001EW5YQS,A1JG2EE1T2WV82,501.Studios,1/1,1314835200,Very good!,i have used the icicle a few times. and it sounds great! everything works how it's supposed to. and it is a very simple but efficient interface. the ONLY thing that i can see that's wrong with it. is it just feels light and cheap. granted its only around $40 so you can't expect too much from it. the plastic just feels rather cheap. but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i don't foresee a major problem on that front.
4101,B001EW5YQS,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,Michael J. Edelman,1/1,1244246400,Pretty good for the money,I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here. but the warranty. Blue's reputation. and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try. And in general. I'm pretty satisfied with it. Using it with one of my Oktava MK-301 microphones I get excellent sound. no hum. and so far. excellent reliability. I'm using it with Audacity and a few other programs. none of which have any difficulty recognizing it. There were some issues setting it up initially. and I'm a bit leery about the plastic construction. but for what I paid I think it's a good value. For those thinking of using it in field recording- stick it inside a carrying bag. and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector. You shouldn't have any problems.
4121,B001EW5YQS,A10APXLM7P5P0G,NO WORLD ORDER- WAKE UP,0/0,1336608000,Cheap reliable solution,Bought this because i didnt want to pay 100 plus for the alternative. Found it to be extremely reliable. Very crisp sound with little to no background noise. Before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap. I disagree. though i do find it to be a bit bulky for it's function. I did drop and break it once. but it  was completely my fault. After breaking it. i contacted customer service. and it was replaced very rapidly. The company's website was easy to navigate. and rather amusing.
4124,B001EW5YQS,A1QMQ85ZW2V4JE,CZABeatz,0/0,1334534400,Awesome. Affordable. Worth it,I don't write reviews at all but I'm just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if you're not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer. phantom power supply. and pre-amp for XLR mic recording. Because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price! Cop you one!
4132,B001EW5YQS,A21VM9WVF8EOSJ,Jonathan C. Warren NiALTA,0/0,1322784000,A tad bit noisy and cheaply made,Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid. it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall. I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars. then sure. Still. it's an OK product.
4139,B001EW5YQS,A1VNSRVQZBNERN,Solomen Grundy,0/0,1274227200,Cost effective solution for low budget home recording,A great tool for low budget home recording. I mic every track to Audacity. I use a low budget dynamic mic and the Icicle gives the right boost for PC recording. I keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the PC.<br />I see some complaints out there about durability. Keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive. NOT something that you would use onstage or throw into a gig bag. Another plus is no drivers or setup. That's important to me when I get home from work and want to record a tune. Just plug it in and go!
4141,B001EW5YQS,A24OR46MO22VYS,Bryan J. Moore,0/0,1269302400,Excellent Buy!!,Great price for what you are getting.  Recording via a USB port ROCKS!!!! The only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability.  It feels like a toothpick in your hand.  It may be more durable than it feels. but I'm still going to be very careful with it.  But. for the price this is only a minor gripe.  Great product. I would recommend it to anyone.
4156,B004391DK0,A164I2IDQLWC7H,JR,0/0,1345075200,Excellent product. versatile and convenient,This replaces many of other brands of Pizza crust mix. cake mix. foccaccia and more.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey. but that is an issue of living gluten free.  Enjoy and be creative with it.
4184,B004391DK0,A3GOXIH8NTUY3X,Bill and Mandy,0/0,1329609600,Finally!  :),My children can not have wheat. gluten. soy. dairy. eggs...  It is very hard to find products that they can have.  We use this for pancakes. pizza crust. cakes.  Basically we just use it in place of flour.  It is so nice to be able to buy Bisquick in the grocery stores now; however it is much cheaper through Amazon!
4189,B004391DK0,A32O1Y2DOSWESZ,blessedbyfour,0/0,1328054400,this is a great product!,I love this!  Such a great product for all us gluten free folks!  It works the same as the regular Bisquick. Their website has tons of gf recipes too!  This makes delicious pancakes and 'magic crust' pies. Yummy!
4195,B004391DK0,A1VZZ7EV4EH3W2,Marge Paulsen,0/0,1326326400,Bisquick. gluten free,I had no idea there was a gluten free Bisquick mix..I made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also...
4201,B004391DK0,A1NNXX4CL5P952,K. Allen,0/0,1322784000,Yummy!,These tasted so good! I was surprised because I have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. I would eat these by choice. not because I have to.
4209,B004391DK0,A3VD5OQC3UQGXQ,Roxy,0/0,1320796800,Yay!!,I have so many food allergies it's ridiculous! I am so happy that they made this product and that is available at a decent price. I was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff I thought I couldn't have anymore. I made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better. They said it was lighter and had more taste! I really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with. Thank you thank you thank you.
4242,B004391DK0,A1WI6FZSJBJF95,Sue Sue,0/0,1299110400,Really good mix,I've tried a few other mixes for pancakes. and they've been awful. but this one is really good. I should buy stock in the co.. because people will be buying this product I'm sure.
4261,B004391DK0,A3I985XRRYSWES,Medical Coder Amy,0/0,1295481600,Yummy!,My daughter was diagnosed with celiac about 2 years ago. and has gone without pancakes ever since...until I happened to come across this at the grocery store.  Really wasn't expecting good results - but it's very good!  The non-celiac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular!  Try it!
4265,B004391DK0,A1TJ4G3XULULRU,Deborah Koch,0/0,1294617600,Celiac friendly.,I love this. I have celiac. so this was the first time I had pancakes. I loved them. so did the rest of the family(they can eat wheat).
4286,B004391DK0,A1Q66P7L82MVUM,GF Girl,0/1,1319673600,Not a fan,My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better. but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste. I would buy again and make my crust very thin.
4297,B004391DK0,A2M1FMU266MVON,Joanne M. Vargas JVargas,0/2,1313452800,These are gross,These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean. when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color. they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!
4298,B004391DK0,AI64Y7RU9JXL1,DigiGirl,1/4,1318723200,Yuck,Was awful. The sight of this in my pan made me sick...smells like POTATO  duh potato starch)...would not brown. My child laughed the entire time...as I complained because I was so hungry and thought I could have a late night pancake session. Totally not the case.  Yes. I am a GF newbie... I tossed the box!
4306,B004391DK0,ADHE8VBOGBX8L,GF Mommy,10/13,1341964800,a total scam,I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick). which is a shame. because I do applaud them for their excellent cake. cookie. and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix. but for:<br /><br />1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour. Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil. leavening. dextrose. salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour. Sugar. Leavening (baking soda. sodium aluminum phosphate. monocalcium phosphate). Modified Potato Starch. Salt. Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup. that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether. even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them. pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store).<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) .<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store).<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials).<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's).<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes. xanthan gum is expensive--but very. very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their mix at home. while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves. but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit. especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us. and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN. EASILY. AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick. you can easily stir up an equivalent. make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time. with very little effort. and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or. if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes. betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder. or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time. stores well. and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store. mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum. about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe. do a google search of betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.
4309,B004391DK0,A3QI9XJFXMATO4,Robby,3/3,1297123200,Great for a few things,This mix is great for biscuits. snicker doodles and homemade chicken nuggets. But in our house that is all. We have been GFree for 3 years and yes. I have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make A LOT of GF stuff for EVERYONE. We LOVE the Pamela's baking mix for pancakes/waffles and sweetbreads and their flour blend THE ULTIMATE BEST out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes. But I will buy this mix (and yes. I do agree it is AWFULLY EXPENSIVE) for those three things I've mentioned and in a GF household. usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste. Not one flour does the best with everything.
4318,B004391DK0,ADO72DBUPFH4M,Ashley O'Neil angeleyez,2/2,1294185600,LOVE THIS!,Love this!  It's so good and makes perfect pancakes.  Love that it's also dairy free.  My husband. who does not have gluten intolerance like I do. likes them as well.  Hard to tell a difference between this and the gluten-y version.<br /><br />I love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods!
4320,B004391DK0,A3N4JE40O6M0JH,SNMalik,4/5,1293494400,An easy solution. but...,...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice-based gluten-free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.<br /><br />I will use the mix I have. but I'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. I'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis. which is usually a sign that this isn't a hit in my household.
4326,B004391DK0,A1ZM06WA7VKFCK,Donna,1/1,1338595200,Gluten free Bisquick,For those with gluten allergies. this is great. The shortcakes. biscuits. pancakes taste much the same as with the regular Bisquick. My only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size. Would love for them to box it in larger sizes.
4329,B004391DK0,A3O28W281QXPNE,CeesMom,1/1,1335398400,Wallpaper Paste,I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes. breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF. so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love. but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked. frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL. and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit. it was more like kindergarten paste. but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up. so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real. delicious fluffy wheat pancake. but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken. but you could do that more economically with another GF flour.
4353,B004391DK0,A2QBXSUFSS5T3S,Janice Gail,1/1,1304899200,gluten free Bisquick,I LOVE this product! After ten years of doing without. the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic! I. too. wish it was packaged in a larger box. but as it is. I don't mind devoting more shelf space to several boxes.
4354,B004391DK0,A3156S6OVZJHHN,amanda d dana,1/1,1304812800,Amazing!,We have been living gluten-free for 5 years now. and this mix is the best I have found!  It makes great waffles.
4362,B004391DK0,A37TM4T4YFU6HD,Philosolaw,1/1,1296950400,Tasty. but pricey,This mix made tasty. crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron. but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles.  This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price.
4366,B004391DK0,AWCDDYGC3DKD1,Captious Consumer CC,1/1,1295308800,Ah. finally some good-ol' dumplings!!,I was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer (sorry to say. cheaper than it is sold here. even with subscribe and save....).  First thing I made was my childhood favorite - dumplings - and they were just like I remembered them to be!  The whole family was happy with them - they were such a big hit!  I can't wait to make blueberry muffins this summer.  I have never been able to duplicate the taste of Bisquick with any other gf recipe. and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same. in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you. General Mills!
4382,B00474ARU8,A22752KDKUXTDZ,R. J. Gigstad Oftenconfused,2/2,1315267200,Great Coffee,I have purchased San Francisco Bay coffee before. I have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. The beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. A very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.
4385,B00474ARU8,A5582IFMLAX8I,RandiB,1/5,1325289600,Not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company,My parents fell in love with 'San Francisco Bay Coffee Company' coffee. which use to be available at our local AZ Costco. For christmas I looked every where for this coffee & found what I thought was a great value on Amazon. When I bought it (12/21/11) there was No Image Available. should have been my first warning sign. They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co. but I wanted something bigger. and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble. but if you look closely it's Roger's Family Company coffee. who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area. So if you're in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company. don't buy this coffee. But on the upside. since I waited till the last minute to buy it. I gave it to my parents for christmas anyway & explained what happened. but they said the coffee was pretty decent. So still makes a nice cup of coffee. just not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company coffee.
4400,B000GPKI10,A29L15GKGGA3UO,Thomas MacEntee Genealogy Ninja and GeneaBlo...,1/1,1194998400,I Felt Like A Thief When I Bought These!,What a steal!  I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6 long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags.  They look like you bought them at a fancy store.  These decorations are the best and they are so cheap.
4401,B000GPKI10,A16PYIG071SFNC,S. Tilton Texas chef,1/1,1191974400,India Tree is SUPERB,India Tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at Amazon.I use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes.  They will get a workout as the holidays near.
4410,B0025VQGHS,A3G0GKTVOQ0G5O,RadioSimIan,7/25,1299283200,Not recommended.,I made one for my daughter's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good. though.
4429,B000E5AO8O,A1QAM7EAVZY4VN,N. Forsa Sweet Tooth,0/0,1240099200,Sticky Fingers,This was my second order of Bit O Honey.<br />The first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missing.<br />I hope Mr. Sticky Fingers found the candy as enjoyable as I did.
4439,B0000GGI00,A21EHWHI9XQY10,D. J. Walters,4/4,1245456000,Pico Pica ... the BEST,I love Pico Pica.  It adds some flavor. and it's not too hot. I eat it at least 2 meals every day. It's good on eggs. it's good on pizza. it's good on vegetables.<br /><br />Really. you can't go wrong.
4465,B000I6G2OO,A23JL8NANKBJLD,Macon Mommy,0/0,1231545600,Who knew this was such a great choice?,I saw these in our local commissary one day and decided I *had* to give them a try.  I was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I had no idea how much I would like these and have to have *more*.  I got one bag of the Raspberry and one bag of the Maple and I love them both!!!  I'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods. especially than the ones I normally choose.  I am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item.  I love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so I can enjoy them more often!  They are light and flaky and satisfying and good...a must for me!
4486,B001EHDMY4,A4COEB2B3PYMV,Civis Americanus Sum,1/1,1302566400,A revolution in tea..,As an ex-Brit. steeped (pun intended!) in strong black tea. I wasn't sure about this. but Revolution White Pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious. light yet flavorful.  The low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course.iced tea. I hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it!
4490,B001EHDMY4,AA6XA0PJZHER1,belowi,0/0,1326844800,Floral tasting tea,I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea. and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement. and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product.
4497,B002TMV3E4,A2UYWE97KME0M,C. A Scovel Christina Scovel,1/7,1284163200,Delicious & Not Bitter,I love coffee.  I love coffee a lot and really don't enjoy decaf.  This decaf isn't bitter though.  Tastes smooth and brews up very nicely.  Enjoyable to the last drop!
4504,B002TMV3E4,A34A7QEBMYTALW,"Arthur Kicker Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged",0/1,1294617600,Good Decaf,I had never heard of this coffee before but I got a bag and really liked it.  This Melitta Cafe Riviera Sunset Decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body.  This stuff is perfect for a late-night cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert.  Its decently priced and I will definitely buy this again.
4522,B002TMV3E4,A4D5B7Q8A7PA6,Vynny Vynrod,0/2,1290038400,Nice for a late night cup,My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah. sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought I'd give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it's a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor. Also. as it's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat - nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know it's a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldn't even stand up. It was about 1/2 thick!<br /><br />So you're not going to have Mr Wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it ain't half bad.
4535,B002TMV3E4,A1QNYLBG73QRNF,Neurasthenic neurasthenic,0/2,1285200000,no complaints,We don't drink much coffee. and less decaf. but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit. Everybody has been pleased with the Melitta. Nobody has complained about the taste. and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they weren't just being politely quiet. We got the first sample free through the Vine program but I would buy it in the future.
4537,B002TMV3E4,A3UKWQS8SRW6IO,TropicalMinnesota,0/2,1285200000,Good. nothing remarkable,This makes a good pot of decaf.  Nothing remarkable - we have served this to many guests to no comments.  Nobody asked us what it was. but nobody spit it out. either :-).  It is smooth and not too strong. which is our preference.  We wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. but wouldn't go out of our way either.
4549,B002TMV3E4,A3A15L96IYUO6V,Michael Smith,0/2,1283731200,Great coffee flavor but still you know it is decaffeinated,If Melitta doesn't sell good coffee. who does?  I grew up using Melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter. Generally I use pre ground coffee (so I am not a purist). although I occasionally grind my own.  I usually drink two cups of coffee a day.  Enough about my coffee habits.<br /><br />Melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry. and I expected this coffee to be be a quality product.  I was not disappointed with the coffee. although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee I recently tried from Melitta.  The flavor was pretty strong and rich. although decaf always has a slight aftertaste. even with the Swiss Water process used for decaffeinating.  Generally. I drink regular coffee as my first choice. but I admit that I switch to decaf in the evening.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice...
4557,B002TMV3E4,A1B3GNO9C8YX0N,Gene Pope gene,0/2,1283212800,very tasty,What can you say about coffee. either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee. although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside. it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one.
4575,B002TMV3E4,A3GASQRWPQW28W,No*BoUnCe,1/4,1283212800,A Decent Decaf ...,First off. I received a bag of this coffee via the Vine Program to review at no cost.  Secondly. I am more of a bold. slap-me-in-the-face French Roast coffee drinker (or StarBucks Gold Coast). so I had my reservations about this decaf.<br /><br />And ... Well. for me. this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package. an OK flavor once brewed (sort of a nutty strange flavor at first). and once consumed. left an after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />It is definitely a different roast than I am used to. but it is decent for a pre-ground Melita decaf.  More of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  Overall ... not too bad.<br /><br />I give this coffee a so-so recommendation.
4594,B0013ENGXK,A214RJ0BMHRUAK,thamnosma,0/0,1332720000,My go-to coffee subsitute,Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure. which is why I drink it.  I've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute. though one must acquire a taste for it.  At home I use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel.
4599,B0013ENGXK,A1B0ZKGS0ZAHQW,V. Mcknelly weiserv,0/0,1174003200,Use it every day,I drink this tea every day (I'm 7 months pregnant). and have done so since I found out I was pregnant.  I love that it's organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy.  I don't notice anything dramatic when I drink it or don't drink it. but I will say I feel nourished when I drink it. and have had NO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS WHATSOEVER.  I'm 36. this is my first pregnancy. and I have been exceptionally healthy throughout.  I highly recommend this for any pregnant woman--at least a cup a day!
4604,B004AH7BZQ,ALZ8XSQFPSMX,Sharon M. Grove shopper,0/0,1350432000,Best  peanut butter made,Was glad to find this procuct on line as it is not sold in stores around here.  Found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try.  Sure glad I did.  I researched this company and they have been in business since 1898. This is the only preanut butter I really like. It is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better.  It doesn't need to add anything.  Great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable.
4607,B00584HTX4,A2T12IEYOI7BZN,Nadia Matejek,0/0,1346630400,Great!,I have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious! They are great for parties and entertaining!

4636,B000FFRY3G,A1XG6TC70LQUL6,E. Hull,1/2,1214352000,These are English muffins??,If you are looking for  English muffins - go to the grocery store and buy them.  These do not even resemble English muffins and are tasteless.  However. if you are on a restricted diet (wheat flour. soy. dairy. gluten.etc.) these might be for you - check the list of ingredients.  I didn't care for them at all.

Get in some real food and I'll buy more from you. I went looking for table sugar. You've got 100 weird kinds of sugar (that you expect me to buy in bulk!) but NO just plain sugar. I'm not eatin' any more of this rice and tofu bread either.<br /><br />Sorry I just had to rant.

Pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture. But in ten years. trying to find them - gee. So now I know to look for it on Amazon.

Rye crispbread replacing almost<br />all of the flour in my diet.  And drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fat.<br />You do need to exercise a little bit too.

4723,B00139TT72,AP9ZZ0KNVIQ1N,Melba,0/0,1322611200,Satisfactory :),Received in a timely manner and in good condition. My Mishka is a little spoiled (I cook her meals when I can afford it. buy her wellness kibble when I can't) but she ate this willingly. I bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping. unlike the much heavier wellness bag. and she was almost out of kibble. I'm happy with the compromise.
4772,B00139TT72,A2KWAK0GAA8IBW,D. Ricker Journeywoman,35/35,1235865600,Give it time,I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys.  You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers. fries. ice-cream. and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No. she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog. Molly. is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style. and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note. this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm. making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner.
4789,B00139TT72,A1XZXP34HZGW8Z,Terese A. Towey Irish Dreamtime,3/3,1263168000,I won't purchase again.,Both of my dogs had trouble with this formula. allergy wise.  It took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food.  Needless to say I won't buy this product again.
4791,B00139TT72,A2UCNQ82DAFPEF,M. Lucky,3/3,1257638400,I agree with the previous reviewer. the name is deceptive.,When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics. one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables. which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very. very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more. just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap. so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole greenwashing thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description. it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation. I buy a lot of their products. but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side. my dog loved it. she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good. it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater. she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously. but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it.
4798,B00139TT72,A1K2HB56JX1MCQ,canoncity,2/2,1316217600,they are not sick anymore,I have three dog friends. Maggie. my 14 year old Aussie had some problems($2.000.00) worth of problems and she was so sick I thought of putting her down. As it turns out there were several issues that the Colo Springs Emergi Vet and Dr Jaime Gaynor fixed and one of them one food allergies that had caused severe problems. After trying several foods and making all my own dog food we tried Paul Newman and all was well. Maggie and her friends thrived. Well Our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from 13 to 17 dollars for 7 pounds. also at Wal Mart is was past its expiration date and rancid. Thank you Amazon. it comes fresh!It is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which I can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date. I cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogs.Our lives are busy. I am a nurse and anything that is dependable. easy. reasonable. comes with excellent customer service. and my friends Maggie. Lucy. and Honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day. Thank you

4821,B00139TT72,AJLMB4MDICVTO,sggall,1/1,1328486400,Not as good as it used to be,This solved my pups dog food allergy problems when I started purchasing it (I have a husky and a german shepherd). but several months ago the itching started again; the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed. I wrote a letter of inquiry to Newman's. with batch numbers from the bags. but have received no answer. Since then. I've purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again.

In Iowa,8/9,1271289600,My Community Coffee,I lived down in Louisanna for 10 years. and Community Coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee. Here in Iowa I can't buy the Comm. Coffee. so when I saw the ad to order through Amazon I jumped at the offer. I got 3 bags of the Hazalnut and I am in Coffee Heaven right now. Thanks Amazon.
4878,B002C56OBU,A2PZT88XPUUEZS,Donna T. Donna T.,1/1,1336953600,We Like It. You Will Too.,We first discovered Community Coffee while on a visit to Lake Charles. LA. And until recently it was only available in LA or by mail.  We prefere the Hazelnut blend. it has a nice rich flavor without being overly strong.  This is very good coffee.  We like it and have a standing order with Amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient intervals.
4879,B002C56OBU,AHKDSWU5HEH9I,Jenny,1/1,1329609600,Taste good to me,I'm not a coffee snob. so I'm not picky about what kind of coffee I purchase. I chose this because it was cheapest by the ounce and best rated. I bought <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WO0>The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Hand-Roasted Hazelnut Ground Coffee. 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> as my first ground coffee. and I have to say. Community Coffee smells and tastes better than Coffee Bean's! This is totally personal preference though.<br /><br />This Community Coffee ground tastes much darker and smoother and it smells good.
4882,B002C56OBU,AQ4FHE7IJEAXO,William D. Stone,0/0,1350691200,Community Coffee,We enjoy Community Coffee when we go to New Orleans. I was glad to see it available in your online store
4883,B002C56OBU,AD7DY0I7TCSGM,LOVELYLADY,0/0,1329696000,Community Hazelnut Coffee,Very pleased with this new coffee. thanx to another user comment and good review from someone recently when I was searching for a better priced coffee. Plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent; all the others are ridiculous on pricing I have noticed. increasing by $4 or $5 in some cases.  I was getting Maxwell House Hazelnut. but this coffee is much tastier; and Maxwell House has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing Community's bolder flavored hazelnut.  You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder. but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer. nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.  I just hope that now. finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price. Amazon keeps it in stock for awhile.
4904,B004JWS0CA,A24WJHCQI3V7BS,Eillas,0/0,1307059200,Wonderful coffee!!!,We love this medium full-flavored roast. Very smooth taste..no bitter or acidic taste. at all.Excellent coffee..good value  :)  Also. try Timothy's Kona..very good.also.
4909,B0009JMW1C,A3VBBRHETBOP3Y,B-Ricks,1/1,1341964800,Great Stuff,I used it for a sinus infection where I lost my voice completely and had a sore throat. I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough. took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep. A must buy. its cheap and natural. You cant go wrong if you give it a try.
4932,B000FYYOZI,ALSW7HGFU3ZRG,Dean Benkowski,0/0,1347321600,Good Beef Sticks,I enjoyed this product.  They are a good value for the amount you get.  I did not sense much honey in the product. so a bit more flavor would be nice.  I would buy again.
4947,B000FYYOZI,A2NI95Y8UNE85D,Coastal Jerky Lover,1/2,1151452800,Sweet beef,Beef sticks and honey - what a great combination! The Ole Smokies beef sticks are full of flavor. Adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top. The Honey Stung Ole' Smokies are always a favorite with our friends; the saddlebag pack is a perfect take-along to football parties.
4949,B002RZ1QNG,A3E72SJY88VI5O,cutsey,1/1,1344816000,This is a good wine but I made some modifications,This wine actually turned out really well.  I made some modifications to the kit however.  If you figure out the potential alcohol content. this kit would probably get around 7%. but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation. I ended up with 13%.  I also didn't use the whole f-pack.  It would have been WAY to sweet.  Instead. I topped the carboy off with an unoaked Chardonnay that I like.
4962,B001DW2RGO,A18WGZSR2TB9RJ,Steele,2/2,1309392000,Has an affect.,Six Hour Power does help to create a more energetic and alert state.  The affect does not last anywhere near six hours.  For me it was a couple of hours.  It is not as strong as Five Hour Power high strength. but it is not positioned as high strength either.  For the money. I would buy this again over the regular Five Hour Power product.
4969,B001DW2RGO,A2BSS7HRW4II80,Drew,0/9,1336953600,Deadly Product,I had to be taken to the ER in an ambulance earlier. the day before yesterday. I was having seizures. near-syncope (passing out. but still being somewhat conscious). couldn't breathe. and my blood pressure was at stroke level. I felt like and thought I was dying (or maybe already) dead for about 3 hours. It was painful and horrifying. I think I figured out what it was that caused my near-death experience. It was probably the energy-shot I took 20 minutes before then. I don't usually take something like that. Someone offered it to me. and I was so tired. I didn't even look at the bottle and took it. Please. don't use these!
4974,B0061YK3O2,A20TB2O54QVQCI,AllenCDenver,0/0,1325635200,Delicious,This olive oil is great.  Tastes very good and is outstanding for use with bread. pasta. and for cooking in general.  Love the flavor.
4980,B001EO5ZDI,A1773950VM8LFD,Laughingbuddah00,1/1,1305244800,What Happened?!,I purchase Banh Trang Spring Rolls Skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls. but recently I got a container with black spots mixed into the skin.  I tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didn't work and had to be thrown away.  At the bottom of the container. 5 skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin.  At that point. I decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until I purchased a fresh batch of a different brand..  When trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly. I was unable locate their company webpage. although there were many references to the Co. name Bahn Trang.
4985,B004PDGUFC,A1UVD7Z3DHJCDS,Hummingbird Sunny,0/0,1346976000,Love Flavia Coffee,We are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the decafe French Roast also. It makes a single fresh cup at a time in our Flavia Coffee maker
4999,B00653KJ5M,A122CSYJ3YSKI0,Shaimun,0/0,1337990400,Great Healthy Snack!,I love these cookies. I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them. I don't even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them. They don't make me crash either and feel like I ate junk food. It is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients. I wish I had these cookies close to me. I'd buy them every single day!
5051,B000E3ZFIK,A2EEH6B3GO2V0A,Mom of Two Elizabeth,0/0,1306627200,Good graham crackers for my kids,I like that these are organic and don't have corn syrup.  My kids and I both like them.  I'd give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe.  The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily.  And if you have kids under 5. you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be.  The taste is still great. but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them.  And when you order these in the mail. like I did last time. don't expect many full graham cracker sheets - most are already broken in two. and quite a few are broken at the edges as well.
5054,B000E3ZFIK,A36WGHR8TO5DKT,Goldwave shopper,0/0,1248912000,Nice with morning coffee,I rarely want to eat much when I first arise in the morning; but I do have coffee.  I've found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee.  They are graham crackers - not anything super-duper amazing - but they are nice. cinnamony graham crackers that are organic.
5058,B000FA3980,A3RD82GSN0C6B2,C. D. Black fast reader,0/0,1206057600,hard to find in stores,I was quite surprised to find that Sociables were available thru Amazon. I cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought I would have to give them up.<br />They arrived quickly. in great condition. and we now are on regular shipments of them.
5063,B007OWEOIQ,A17QK8KTU1JXSM,E. Vinson Not all who wander are lost...,2/3,1344470400,About the only good thing..,Is that these are 60 calories per serving. however. in all honesty. I didn't make it through a full serving.<br /><br />I was excited about these. they looked like a grown up graham cracker.<br /><br />First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic. and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is. but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp. hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very. very wrong about that. They have a funky. chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously. it was awful.<br /><br />I tasted these about 45 minutes ago. and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth. I CAN STILL TASTE IT.<br /><br />I'm glad these were an add-on. but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though. so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful. I'd have just got a second bag of <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158>Hi I'm Skinny Sticks. Sweet Onion Multigrain. 7-Ounce</a>.<br />Only 30 cent more than these. but MILES better in taste.
5069,B005H3BYHI,A2YXF8J8PT41ST,Abz Breathe with gentle focus,1/1,1334534400,Tiny bubbles...makes me happy...I don't want to share!,First off. there is a difference when you drink something out of box versus glass. A big difference.<br /><br />I was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle. I snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink.<br /><br />I had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago. Only to find out when I got home that they didn't sell the canned version at my store. I was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online.<br /><br />I have tried the other brands. This is by far the best. It could be because it's in a glass. I'm not a high end taste tester but I just know there is a big difference. And this stuff is like wine...best served when chilled. So being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world. Guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled. I'll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck. I'm a foodie. I love savoring food and beverage.<br /><br />A lot of people are mentioning it's over priced. Compared to what? And if you notice it's not Amazon selling it. it's a distributor using Amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it. The free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case. They could reduce the price but then it would probably say $10-$15.00 for shipping. It really would not make a difference.<br /><br />But I'm happy it's at my local health food store. I'm not ready to buy this by the case. Woohoo. Thanks. Taste Nirvana. This really is Happiness in a bottle. Go get your own. I'm not sharing ;)
5075,B005H3BYHI,AUVCJD046BUJS,nutstarr02,0/0,1328918400,Favorite coconut water!,This is my favorite coconut water! Having traveled in Asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete. nothing I found in the store came close... until I found Taste Nirvana. The other brands are mostly from Brazilian coconuts. whereas this brand uses Thailand coconuts and it makes a difference.  Truly happiness in a bottle. It's a little pricey. but I can't get enough!
5078,B005H3BYHI,A16OX6U12GNZIT,islandboy08876,2/14,1319846400,not even close to coconut water!,Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED sweeting things is an american custom. which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2. and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar. its natural.<br />I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed. caned and packaged coconut water are nasty. i am still yet to try a brand. one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it.
5085,B001EO5ZFQ,A1TMCBQY0DGOYM,C. Lopez,2/2,1214006400,Tasty!,Great sauce! Used in many Jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. Most use Walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice.
5110,B001VNGN0Q,A8WKNCN7FUZ3U,H. Vardhan vardhans001,12/12,1256601600,Fragrant and delicious,As someone who goes through lots of thyme (I use it in everything except cereal). I was pleasantly surprised to see this product on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Looks. smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about 5-10x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe 2 weeks in my house :).
5117,B003QM6ZDU,AU9TCXW199NP8,clipship,2/2,1278460800,So good it could be a beverage!,I brought some of this back from a trip to Jamaica and wished I had bought it by the gallon.  It is very hard to find but WELL worth ordering in bulk!  It is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to Jamaica with every taste.  I have attempted to duplicate it many times but can't seem to get it right.  I am ecstatic to finally have found a source.
5135,B0028VAQSU,A2OILLBO679W8C,herbstore,0/0,1322697600,just as described,The product arrived undamaged just as it was described on the website. No delays and arrived quickly. The customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order.
5139,B0028VAQSU,A1MDQXB2W637D0,Rhonda Conner,0/0,1292716800,great for pancakes and waffles and a whole lot more!,It's hard to find quality gf products. and pamela's doesn't dissapoint. I always recommend this. I go through a lot of this blend with a family of five. Amazon helps keep it more affordable. The pancakes are great and the waffles are really good. I haven't tried it with much else yet. but my sister-in-law does chocolate scones  frequently  with great raves. I use the bread mix also all the time. and am very pleased with both.
5140,B0031YJ38W,A6FIAB28IS79,Samuel Chell,3/3,1288742400,Best of Breed,I started eating these after reading Esselstyn's popular book on heart disease (heal through eating oatmeal).  There's no way I can choke down cooked oat meal; eating oatmeal cookies. on the other hand. is something I can swallow.  All of Erin Baker's cookies appear to be made with oatmeal. and the three that I've tried are palatable enough.  Nevertheless. the Fruit & Nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that I most looked forward to savoring each morning (I hope it wasn't because of lower oatmeal content than the other three).<br /><br />In short. you don't have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you--despite the Fruit & Nut flavor--have to be a little fruity (to quote Norman Bates' audible thoughts in Hitchcock's Psycho) or a health nut to find these tasty and nutritious--maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so). And the advantage of the mini size is that you might feel better--less guilty. at least--about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time.
5147,B0031YJ38W,AY1EF0GOH80EK,Natasha Stryker,0/0,1325116800,Dry and too fruity,These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea. coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain.  I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be.  I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies. and of the regular size EB cookies. but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty.  I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these.  Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs. but not my favorite.
5150,B0031YJ38W,A3F6O5P04KL572,K. Torab Kian,0/0,1251417600,Erin. I wanna marry you!,I love these cookies and I love Erin as a result. These cookies make me smile. The texture makes my eyes googly. The smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome it'd be to spend them with Erin. have her bring the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor swing listening to the birds and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyard.<br /><br />The only thing is that this kind and the other kind (raisin) don't differ much in taste. They both taste the same--taste of Heaven.
5170,B0002UDY9W,A18ZP8SFD2VC3A,Mariel,2/2,1329955200,So yummy!,I love tea. hot or cold. and am always looking to try new ones. This tea brews up a wonderful cup - just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy. The smell alone is captivating. I tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately. It really does taste just like good quality licorice and it's naturally sweet. When my urge for sweets hits. I can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings. This tea will be a staple in my pantry.
5178,B003FWKCB2,A137OMDVBAM3A8,fruitsnacklover,0/0,1313280000,Delish!,I found these little awesomely delicious fruit snacks at a gluten free show in Wisconsin.The guy that was there offered me a package and I fell in love!They are organic. which makes them all the more cool. and they are very. Very tasty!I looked on the ingredients and was surprised to find no high fructose corn syrup!They're a little chewy at first. but I can not find anything else wrong with them. They are a wonderful fruit snack that I don't feel guilty about eating afterwards!
5201,B003R0LKSG,A3L5YMME3V8U9P,cat_butler,1/2,1308614400,my 3 cats won't eat it,I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it. not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing.
5204,B003R0LKSG,A3OBOS5TOKKK5T,Catkeypurr,1/3,1291420800,Great ingredients BUT...,Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I don't mush them several of my cats just eat around them.<br />The cats & I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and it's a little cheaper. too.
5211,B000G1X456,A27I4SNG31S63E,E. Anne Fischer Annie,0/0,1311206400,Not the best,Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.<br /><br />It tastes like.....well. I can't use the words I'd like to.<br />Let's just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee. I don't know if you'd even know it was coffee!<br /><br />I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help.
5218,B0009OMU00,A35MG6ZZ299ATZ,S. C. Dixon Photography D. J. DiAblo,3/3,1203120000,The most popular snackfood in our night club...,I own a small night club and this is. hand's down. the most popular snack item we have. At first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore. In addition it is not available anywhere in town and. before we found it here. we had to go to a Sam's club 50+ miles away to stock up on it. apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find. The company also makes a Club mix. as opposed to the Pub mix. I made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele. They look about the same but apparently the Club mix lacks some vital ingredient.
5220,B0009OMU00,A3MYTHNJ08MGYE,Princessa,2/2,1152403200,hard-to-find excellent snack,I found these tubs at Costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them. I buy the 4-pack here at amazon and I am very satisfied. The snacks are tasty; not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely.
5227,B0009OMU00,A2749L3OB3ZVN8,Jaime L. Lagattuta,0/0,1222732800,Great Snack,This mix is great anytime.  I love it.  Would recommend it to anyone that likes Chex mix.
5237,B0012YEKCW,A2FY0W833BRDPI,K.N.,7/7,1222473600,Easy-to-grow and cats love it,I've had luck with this seed and all the other packets I've purchased from Botanical Interests (the company that makes it).<br />Right now. the packet's over a year old and I recently planted another pot and had a high germination rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four days.<br />The cats love it. They ate so much I planted yet another pot.<br />Having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things. like plastic. especially when they are having digestive problems.
5241,B0012YEKCW,A3MI6HFBGEFO4P,Robert P. Seaton,3/3,1284422400,Daily Serving of Greens -- For Your Cat!,Cat grass. also known as wheat grass. is a great plant for anyone. I typically don't do any type of gardening. but I had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow. These seeds make a great project for gardeners. cat lovers. and children. too.<br /><br />The hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely! That's what happened to mine. at least. and my cats still -- several months later -- will check the area where I kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant.
5256,B0012YEKCW,A24CK08H4TDRUE,Tiger,0/0,1338595200,Tiger loves the cat grass..,Tiger loves the cat grass..It only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come up..So it grows very fast..I planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside..
5299,B0017T1LI8,A3DG8KXGSRR3RP,T. Lo,4/14,1235779200,Good taste but made in China.,Just received a case of this tea.  It tastes good and a bit on the sweet side. but not overly sweet.  I would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in China though.
5305,B004XMIRU6,A1KZUXE70GYNGO,talonmedic,1/1,1338336000,Excellent stuff reasonabale price,Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild. no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on.
5307,B004XMIRU6,A1NKZ7A7T47413,Amazon Fan,1/1,1336780800,Wow that Expensive for coffee,This is by far the best Kona Coffee I've had. I use to purchase Trader Joes Kona Coffee but for the last several months they haven't had any and I've been unable to locate Kona any where so I thought I'd try Amazon. I saw this and although the price is staggering. the coffee is amazing. Very smooth with great taste. I drink it both hot and cold. A pound makes a lot of coffee and while I didn't figure the price per cup. I still think it's worth it and will purchase it again.
5308,B004XMIRU6,A321BN463YM9GG,Fahad Mania,1/1,1332979200,definately worth it,I have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors. and I can say that this one is a very special coffee. I made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags I've bought. The coffee lost it's freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old. dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag. I wasn't sure what was the problem. cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic. The freshness. texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana. I was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee. Immediately I knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee.<br /><br />I've tried different regional coffees including. papa new guinea. Kenya AA. Sumatra beans. Jamaican blue mountain ... and others. I have to say that Kona is my favorite by far. The shipping bag comes oxygen free when it's being shipped from the vendor. The air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it. Sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping. I guess that's what happened to one of the bags. As you know. coffee and oxygen don't go well together. cause once the coffee is oxidized; it starts losing its freshness and it doesn't taste the way it's supposed to taste.<br /><br />I've made a recent purchase again and I'm very happy with the results. Give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment. You have got nothing to lose. Well done Hawaii Roasters. You guys have outdone yourselves.
5311,B004XMIRU6,AK32R84NM1HDJ,Julie Nelson glittery_one,1/2,1327536000,Coffee not great but the customer service is.  :),This coffee. whether brewed in the Keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale.  Not the award-winning coffee that I expected to taste.  It didn't take me back to Hawaii. but instead took me to the Folger's coffee aisle in the grocery store.  Will not order again.  What a waste of money.<br /><br />updated 2/3/12 - The seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money.  He apologized for the coffee not being up to standard.

5331,B000BYLQW6,AYUYRDNKE4IFR,B. Geiger,0/0,1345161600,Fabulous,My Pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one.  I can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere.  They are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her.
5334,B000BYLQW6,A3QXDGVQHUVJF,Protect Ur Pet,0/4,1292198400,SUGAR IS BAD FOR DOGS (First Ingredient is Sugar),I can not believe that this is actually for sale. It needs to be recalled. Sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets. They do not digest/assimilate sugar like we do. Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list. DO NOT BUY IT!!
5342,B004565GV8,A2GJTNQH0SS7RI,rrscar,2/2,1316390400,Great but stale,I like the Dessert Delights line. and this is one of their better flavors. But the carton I received contains only packs that are stale. The sticks are stiff and difficult to chew. and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes. I'm quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers.
5360,B004565GV8,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko Sooo many books, so little time!",1/2,1329782400,Very yummy!,So far I've tried all of the flavors and while there are some I'm not over the hill about. I've had pretty good experiences with them.<br /><br />This is one of the flavors I'd purchase again. I'm a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored. so I had to give this a try. I'll admit up front that I haven't had a key lime pie for years. so I don't remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general. though.)<br /><br />This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there. but it's backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey. it's 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldn't want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesn't last nearly long enough.<br /><br />I'll absolutely buy this again. despite the flavor only lasting 1-2 minutes.

5390,B00622CYVS,A1CECSIFKCGMMS,K. Piper-Fangman,4/4,1234137600,Earth's Best is the BEST,We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners. and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself. and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well.
5397,B00622CYVS,ATIHDHZYNQ0EI,Kristen O'donnell twinsmom,1/1,1270425600,Organic and Tasty,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
5413,B00622CYVS,A2KIVODZRTGY4U,Gwendolyn Dawson Literary License,0/0,1305590400,Good variety; good flavors,This is a nice variety of flavors--two are meat-based (chicken and turkey) and two are vegetable-based (summer veggie and rice/lentil).  My 9-month-old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors.  I've had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods. so I'm happy to have found two meat meals that she loves.  As with other Earth's Best varieties. these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives.
5419,B00622CYVS,A2FCB8C3BXOOAI,S. Gilstrap,1/2,1250726400,Not my favorite product.,I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin. and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food. or use the Gerber organic.
5441,B00622CYVI,A36UA434L423AU,D. Dunlap Dave the Dad,86/89,1305590400,BPA no longer an issue,****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced. but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then. when our daughter was going to begin daycare. there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best.  It was organic. and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice. easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors. though some she hated as well.  All in all. we were pleased. and baby seemed pleased.<br /><br />Needless to say. I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it. and while I couldn't find anything definitive. here's what bothered me:  Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority. call us to discuss.  That's only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website. they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased. but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey. we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X. which is so low. there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product. I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something. I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent. but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />***UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free. but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner. that does contain BPA. but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer. but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them. but I will say there was no hold time at least.

My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour/spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore.

It cooks really well. not sticky at all (I use a bit of coconut oil and cook it in organic vegetable broth.) Tastes great! I am not typically a brown rice lover but this kind was really good. My kids and husband ate it and asked for seconds as well.  Was delighted to see it on Amazon and for such a great price with subscribe and save!

5550,B004G94ZPW,AGXZACYDNMYTH,krisy,0/0,1334102400,Great deal and everyone loved them!,I bought these to add to my Easter favors. I love the colors for that reason - basic and pastel - all of which are different flavors.  I didn't eat any myself but my friends who received the favors LOVED them!  I have a Prime Account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on (other reviews mentioned this).  Can't complain about the price for a 5 pound bag. It was a great deal and if I needed buy gummies in bulk again I would definitely buy these mini bears.
5592,B000G1X45G,A3HKIMX1FT8C8R,thomas Alexander,0/0,1339977600,Great coffee for the price,I love cofee.  Yuban is one of the better ones. Maxwell House is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent.  Yuban is rich. robust. and stronger than most other coffees I have tried yet not bitter. Overall. I highy recommend it.
5597,B000G1X45G,A2L7E5YIICYVJJ,Bry-man,0/0,1315699200,Still the best coffee!,We were looking for a smooth. rich. non-acidic. non-bitter coffee when we came upon Amazon's reviews for Yuban coffee.  Well. we've been buying Yuban Original Roast Ground Coffee from Amazon for about a year now. and folks. what can we say. it's still the best tasting coffee around.  Coupled with our marvelous Bunn coffee maker (also an Amazon purchase) which makes a fresh. hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes. it just doesn't get any better than this.<br />Keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is (it fluctuates up and down quite a bit) and when you can catch it at a great deal. buy some.  You won't be disappointed.
5604,B000G1X45G,A3HIBUY8VEUONW,Mary A. Rowe Coffee Drinker,0/0,1233878400,Best Coffee in the U.S.,My husband and I recently moved here from Las Vegas to Steeler Nation. We have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide. We had been drinking Yuban for at least 10 years in Las Vegas. We called the District Manager for Kraft and found out that East Coast people don't like it or were not accustomed to it. West of the Mississippi is where you'll find it. So we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure. We got the best deal from<br />Amazon; and it arrived very quickly without paying anything extra in shipping fees.  Time to order it again!!
5616,B000LDOMT6,A1GID2DIBQ527W,Shane Estep,2/3,1252713600,Giants Sunflower Seeds,These sunflowers seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the Salt & Pepper is very bold.  I love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time I have ordered.
5636,B000EUJLHE,AGT4AMNGOIYSM,Mysstryss,0/0,1349222400,True To Their Name,These crackers are certainly Crisp and Light. I am a low-carb eater and am happy to have something crunchy to munch on while watching my carbs (4 net carbs per cracker for Atkin's followers). If you are used to buying different flavors in the grocery store. the ones that come in the kind of flimsy paper wrapping. these actually arrived in a more sturdy cardboard box. For the people complaining about bland taste. I think the point is to put stuff on them not necessarily eat them as is. I like that they have a very mild flavor so as not to overpower what you put on them. you can top with something savory or sweet. My favorite toppings are cream cheese. ham and cheese. chicken salad or sugar-free preserves (they are sturdy enough to stand up to spreading cold cream cheese on them).
5651,B000EUJLHE,A187FX56O66OHG,BRONXGIRL10 Suzanne,0/0,1215043200,The Absolute Best Cracker For Those Watching Their Carb Intake,As a person who has metabolic syndrome (and my roommate has insulin resistance). we both always have to watch our carb intake.  Giving up foods such as pasta. potatoes and most breads has been a very difficult. but also a very necessary part of my life over the past several years.  I've tried lots of other low-carb crackers (including other Wasa crackers). but they've just been so-so.  About six months ago. I picked up a Wasa Crisp 'n Light cracker for the first time and WOW. what a taste!  Spread a little bit of Earth Balance on it. or some low-fat cheese and it's absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  I'm so glad that I can get a case every three months through my Amazon subscription.

Spread with reduced fat peanut butter. just 3 pts. A light part of a light lunch! I used to buy them at the supermarket. but they don't always have them. When I found them on Amazon. I was thrilled! And using the automatic reorder feature. saved me 15% and no cost shipping! Woo-hoo!. Might I add. you can change the frequency of that at any time.
5676,B000H23YC2,A1GI315FX7YFIX,Ronald Brown,2/2,1202688000,Only the best Country Gravy EVER!!,This is by far the best Peppered Country Gravy mix you can buy!  I have tried them all(almost).  It is also very diverse in what you can do with it..  Add sausage for sausage gravy. chicken broth and chicken for an awesome creamy chicken gravy.  Same with turkey. ham. etc..  Nothing compares to SM's mixes. unless you make it from scratch and are good at it.

5695,B00434J6YK,ATM0FEJBT1XIX,Earth Watcher,0/0,1329523200,Tasty and no wheat. but contain soy and palm and canola oils,Pros:<br />- These are definitely tasty -- especially when taken from the freezer!<br />- Wheat is not one of their ingredients. so they're OK for gluten-sensitive but non-allergic people.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- They contain (less than 2% of) soy (lecithin) which is a state recognized allergen.<br />- They contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market. devoid of nutrients and chemically processed.<br /><br />May be a con:<br />- They contain palm oil which unless harvested conscientiously (and more expensively) significantly contributes to the rainforest destruction e.g. in Indonesia. I don't know how Nature Valley's suppliers harvest their palm oil -- hence the separate may be a con category.
5706,B00683FY54,A313YCOCQ050AX,Samantha McCormick Gluten freeness,0/0,1332806400,Healthy breakfast,I love oatmeal for breakfast. but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix-ins that I usually don't have time. This instant granola is just about perfect. The only thing wrong with it is that it's a bit too sweet. When I don't have time to make oatmeal in the morning. I throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when I get to work. It's also a great portion manager; it takes the guesswork out of how much oatmeal is in one serving.

Maybe one other flavor. I think the one with crab. they sorta ate. but definitely this one. So. I ordered a couple packs of 12 small cans. I feed them 1 can per day along with their dry food. They also like Weruva canned cat food and a new one called Addiction canned cat food which so far they love all the flavors I got them. My one skinny cat is super crazy over the Lobster Consomme part. but both cats eat it all. Nutritionally. sardines are really high in RNA which is a building block and RNA also contains the sugar ribose.

Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.<br /><br />If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat.

I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.<br /> 1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally. it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an instant buckwheat<br /> 2. It tastes quite different than usual<br /> 3. There is a strong metallic smell<br /> 4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper.

The premium oolong tea is good. but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium. and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you'll do well to buy their products.
5827,B004QDMY42,A3R1D7H3PIFONU,Michael Jandrok,6/7,1302998400,Good. long-lasting flavor. a really good gum!,It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven't exactly made a career out of rating gum. but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I'd better get in a few words on it. I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.<br /><br />The Peppermint with Ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. It only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in. And man. does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.<br /><br />Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer. although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
5828,B004QDMY42,A3BITTZBO4N71P,VK,0/3,1312329600,I'm confused with this gum.,Hi. i ordered this product from another website but i wanted to post a review on here since it has the same product.<br />Okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others. just pure and simple...maybe too simple?.<br />they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail. on the back it says allergy warning CONTAINS: SOY  another fail<br />they dont tell us what the gum does. does it whiten teeth? fight bad breath? or what!? you know...<br /><br />it has the word Vitality. which means active but thats all they say nothing more?....<br /><br />the taste is like any other gum
5829,B004IZN7H6,A2AR60IJ1W5943,lemonhead,0/0,1337299200,dog loves this,I would have to say that my dog is a picky eater. I have tried all types of different brands of food and finally found one that she loves. She also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds I think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin. I only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore. Also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery. All in all If Mona's happy so am I.
5841,B001EQ5EJQ,A3JQXKDTMK4Z9H,Bunadoo,15/15,1252713600,Lovely lovely taste but be sure to shake before using,I make an extended butter using this oil. water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn't know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick. almost sludgy. with the roasted bits.  Amazon's price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that's all).
5850,B001EQ5EJQ,A1ZBHXKAB5VGDG,Priscilla S. Palmer,4/4,1299888000,walnut oil,I enjoy the flavor and use it for much of my cooking and add it as the oil to my home made granola.  It does not cook well on high heats (as advertised). but does well at medium to low heat.  It's health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils.  I use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor.

5859,B001EQ5EJQ,A1DOMU4NIGWPC7,Mark Schneider,2/2,1309996800,Delicious and high quality,We've been using walnut oil for many years; we brush it on toast to take the place of butter. eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. It's also wonderful in salads--try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes. and a fruity vinegar. This product is of excellent quality and Amazon has a great price for it.

We started her on Pediasure in the mornings as an insurance policy that she was getting enough nutrion. It worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining :). She loves the taste. especially the strawberry flavor.

But. if you have time to spare or don't mind waiting for some good eats. this is the oatmeal for you.<br /><br />Step 1. pour some milk into a sauce pan; Step 2. add a dash of salt [or salt to taste]; Step 3. add oatmeal. making sure it stays covered by milk; Step 4. turn on stove to low heat [not too low but definitely not too high. as you don't want the milk to evaporate/dry out leaving you with tough oats in pan] and cover pan; Step 5. do some little cleaning to built up appetite making sure to ck on progress periodically; Step 6. add more milk if oats are still too tough and let it simmer for a little while longer; Step 7. get your ladle/just pour directing into a bowl add a few raisins/cranberries/your favorite dried fruit and ENJOY!

I use this because I have very low sodium levels and my doctors do not want me drinking free water.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it didn't arrive when promised and I didn't have it in time to take with me on vacation.
5934,B001O2IX8E,A3KDZCQ82JFWLN,Phoebe Oh,2/2,1245888000,Some broken jars,When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal. I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors. which in general taste quite good. so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon. we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived. one of the 12-packs seemed ok. but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box. which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery. but either way. I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too. because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items. I still order from Amazon. but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.
5967,B001NVEJKC,A2DCS0VQMMHP8X,Nathaniel V. Graham,2/2,1333497600,Terrible cheap chocolates for outrageous prices.,I bought these for my wife for her birthday. she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one. and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why. they taste like they have no sugar in them. and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted.
5975,B0028PHHLU,A3HPYGPNPSKL18,light reader,0/0,1345939200,great value,i love that i can get both flavors in one container. and at the asians store around where i'm at they go for about a buck. sometimes more. so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save
5985,B00063480O,A2QENDJC7PPMHF,Patricia Flynn-Williams,0/2,1293494400,My dogs love the taste!,Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay. it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered. but small. which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days. they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis. they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible. so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient.
5988,B000I6PXLC,AF7DUY08T2J87,Elizabeth &34;missy&34;,2/2,1250553600,Good coffee. with some exceptions.,The first batch I got must have been a bad batch. because it seemed to have a burned coffee smell. and smelled a bit more like chocolate raspberry or some other flavor rather than pure chocolate. It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor. and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Since then. I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times. however. when those burned flavor notes creep back in. depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon. Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker. oilier. and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder. more like Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee. even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean. as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices. Those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table I do not buy any longer. So this brand is no longer one that I will purchase. Plus they engage in farming activities that are not ecologically sound. I suggest starting with Intelligentsia.

I am not a heavy coffee drinker but sometimes when I have to study I need a quick pick me up and this will do it. I love all their product. Sometimes I add a little cinnamon grade AA and it really gives it a boost. I would definitely buy this product again and I think it is a good price. I saw it for a lot more in the store.

I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.
6070,B000H227BG,AM95Y8S9VSCO0,Hugh Dunnit Dionysus,3/7,1233187200,Tastes Good. But it's a lot of one flavor,The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It's different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there. I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily. there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor. I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++

I'm not really a caramel person. but if I had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet-salty-buttery richness it would be these Caramel Sea Salt Squares. I found them at Whole Foods and they are expensive. but worth every penny. Milk is the perfect compliment. Get some and you will not be disappointed. You may be ruined for chocolate brownies.
6187,B000UOFW9K,A26CTOXU4Q2U6V,S. C. Skinner,2/2,1214006400,Great Chips. bad shipping,I tried these chips on a whim while shopping at COSTCO. They stopped carrying the chips and I had to look elsewhere for these delicious snacks. No local store carried them. so I turned to Amazon.com in hopes of finding them. As soon as I discovered them on the list of foods carried by Amazon. I ordered a box.<br />When the box of chips arrived. I opened a bag of the  Riceworks Salasa Fresca chips. only to find not a single whole chip. The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product. but. most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.<br />It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping. Because of the condition of the chips upon arrival. I will not buy them from Amazon.com again.<br />Great Chips when they are whole. A great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces.
6206,B002GWHCLK,A3GQSZ2RVVXDCZ,Jon Kreisler,0/0,1299888000,Really Good Hazelnut Coffee,Finally. an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.<br />Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth. medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.<br />The flavoring is not sweetened. which is a real plus. especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do. you have complete control yourself.)<br />The flavor is not overpowering. but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.<br />Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant. but. as with any other food product. variations and accidents do happen.<br />I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.<br />This one is a winner.

6231,B001SAYI2W,A31J176KH7ZZEY,Lalita Tawjareon,4/4,1312070400,Nice Swedish Treat!,All of my family members are fans of fruit jams. jellies. and preserves because they are versatile food products that any person of any age can consume. These food products are also friendly for people with TMJ/jaw problems as well. When I tried Hafi's Cloudberries Preserves from Sweden. I decided to try Felix's Lingonberries Preserves. too. Like the other Amazon reviewer said. if you like the taste of cranberries. then you'll probably like this lingonberries preserve. This lingonberries jam has berries in it and looks beautiful as you spread the preserves on pancakes and soft bread. It's the color red. and kind of reminds me of cranberries. the taste and look of them. especially cranberry dressing and salads during American Thanksgiving meals. Swedish lingonberries are very sweet and tart. My recommendation is to buy both Hafi's Cloudberry Preserves and Felix's Lingonberries Preserves for your household and when you're entertaining guests. Why? - because each person has different tastes. and Swedish cloudberry preserves is more mild with less tartness. and would accomodate the people who wouldn't appreciate the tartness of Swedish lingonberries. If you have both Swedish cloudberry and Swedish lingonberry preserves. then you would cover all your bases in terms of pleasing every family member and guest. When it comes to eating this jam straight from the spoon. personally for me. it is really tart. tangy. and a little strong. While with cloudberry preserves. I could probably eat the whole jar without tasting or sensing a strong tartness. Personally for me. this lingonberries preserves tastes great with vanilla yogurt; it reminds me of Yoplait's fruit in the bottom yogurts. According to Felix. on their jar. they say that these lingonberries ripen during summertime in northern Sweden. The ingredients in these preserves are: wild lingonberries. sugar. and fruit pectin. Felix also suggest putting these preserves on meat. I ordered these jars from the seller on Amazon. and they did a good job wrapping and taping bubble wrap to protect each jar from breaking during transport. Anyways. I highly recommend trying Swedish lingonberries and Swedish cloudberries preserves. Both of these Swedish treats offer different tastes that are yummy and good!

I think it is the wonderful flavor of camomile plus the spearmint that adds that extra something refreshing...ahhhh...(sigh)...big yawn...I'm toddling off to sleep now........  P.S.  I also love a cup anytime I'm feeling somewhat stressed and especially whenever I need to wind down like after a long time on the computer or after stressful shopping trips.

This is more of a quick bread than a cake. and it requires a can of cream style corn.  The result is very moist and has a good corn flavor.  I bake it in muffin pans in cupcake papers. and a dozen are small.  It makes about 8 good sized muffins.  I also bake these longer than specified on the package. because I seem to like things that are more done than many people.  These store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator---if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal.
6291,B00061U6AW,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,Bu-Chan,1/1,1178928000,Not By The Box,I really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from Meiji. The chocolate has a great. and not too sweet. taste. The nuts are a bit small. if you are used to larger varieties. but that is a small problem.<br /><br />I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea. as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace. they are a real treat.

Ohara,1/1,1177891200,1st rate from someone who knows better,This will be a short review (for me).<br /><br />I am somewhat of a tea connoisseur. so for me to give a tea 5 stars... well this is a first for me in an Amazon review.<br /><br />Like other reviews of this product. it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand sewn tea unfold in the pot; delicate. thin first flush leaves surround a beautiful red center of hibiscus.  The liquor is a light honey color. and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them. or as a gift for someone.

Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium.

It may be grain free. but food still smells. looks like. and fine details in label indicate highly processed with all the extra vitamins & minerals. which I think is the turnoff for the kitties. Doesn't say up front. but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell. which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand. but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit. chicken. bird. wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones. grains. etc.

McCullough pacey1927,3/3,1336953600,Not real veggies. but a really good 'better' than chips snack,It wouldn't be very smart to replace real veggies with these veggies straws but if you want a healthier salty snack I personally can't think of a better one on the market.  The portion size for 130 calories is absolutely gluttonous.  One portion is equal to 38 straws.  That is quite a bit of snacking for 130 calories.  These are crispy and taste great.  There is no trans fat. no preservatives. and kosher certified.  The single serving does have 7 grams of total fat and 11 carbs.  Eating these all the time might not be great for your diet but when you want something this is fantastic option.  I have lost 92lbs in the last year and half by following a sensible diet and I am happy to say this brand of Veggie Straws has helped me along the way.

The pouch makes it easy to get the product out. without making a mess and the lid is easy to refasten. so you can use it again over a few feeds.

The pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days. as my baby is still just learning to eat solids. therefore didn't have it all. The top makes it easy to refasten. so it doesn't go to waste and can be used again. I love the pouch. it's easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess.

6557,B003AYL9NU,A74SHV5ZD3RLT,R. Ellis Bobby,9/9,1307318400,Great Greenie alternative!,We have a 3 year old Maltese that we used to shower with Greenies (1-2 a day) even though it says to limit them to one per day.  The last time we took him to the vet. we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8>Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs. Teenie Pack. 96 Chews</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18>Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones. 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews. I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a small dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one. he ate half of it. then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days. he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew. Greenies and Zukes.  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free. corn free. soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do. then they are a great alternative to Greenies.
6578,B002BRC562,A1ETN863U836XZ,JSL JSL,11/11,1272240000,Great for endurance athletes,They're not as compact as gels like Gu. but these are great for marathoners.  I empty 2 bags into a small plastic baggy. I carry the baggy in a neoprene pouch.<br /><br />I try to eat about 2 chews every 1.5-2 miles. beginning at mile 4.  Water to wash them down helps. but isn't a necessity.  Easy to eat on the run.  Good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes.  No stomach upset. which I always got w/ Gu.
6582,B002BRC562,A2WISTRZ17G6R8,J. Vincent Legg,2/2,1308096000,Best Thing On The Trail,I hate to just echo everyone else. but these things<br />really ARE that good. Like a lot of folks. I hadn't<br />heard of these before Backpacker Magazine<br />raved about them in April of '09.<br />I gave 'em a try and was blown away.<br /><br />Over the years I've found that I find food<br />--on long hikes--less and less appetizing...<br />especially when the temperature is over 90.<br />The thought of chewing and swallowing is<br />not appealing.<br /><br />Obviously SOME nourishment is still necessary.<br />but I came to dread PowerBars. and then next. the<br />tastier bars they spawned. So I switched to gels.<br />but after awhile. I came to dread those. as well.<br />But these little chews are delicious--I'll eat them<br />even when nothing else sounds good.<br />Between hikes. I keep them out of sight. because<br />otherwise I'd snack on them at home.<br />I'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike.
6615,B005GLNKOQ,A2ES1MUDPEWGCM,emeredith5,0/0,1339459200,Makes a perfect soup base!,I had gotten a box of Malher Hilachas style sauce from my mother and set it aside for a rainy day - well. today it rained. I mixed the package with water. added rice. some peppers. onion. chicken and potatoes and let it simmer. My entire family just loved it - even my picky grandson! Now. I want to find more!!!!
6617,B001LG945O,A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,"Raul G,",0/0,1246320000,Serve On the Rocks,I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the The Switch Orange Tangerine is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about The Switch... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with No Sugar Added and No Preservatives. One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said. I can't see myself drinking The Switch everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair. I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still. for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend The Swtich. The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang.
6618,B001LG945O,A2507ZYWGMY9BK,Goosecat,0/0,1246233600,Good natural soda,For those that want a more natural soft drink. this is a good option because it has no added sugars. It still manages to pack 140 calories in an 8oz bottle so don't drink this regularly if you're trying to lose weight. The taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks. is a little too sweet for my taste. I would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though.
6627,B001LG945O,AN0N05A9LIJEQ,critters,0/0,1245974400,very different...,While Switch Orange is VERY orangey. it also tastes of something else interesting. It's fizzy (but not. in my opinion. excessively so) and tasty. and I'd consider buying it. I seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas; I just don't care for all the fizz burning my nose. Switch didn't do that. Hurray!!!
6635,B001LG945O,A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G,Once in a while,0/0,1245888000,Gets an A-plus for 100% juice and no HFCS,No caffeine. no high fructose corn syrup. 100% juice. nothing artificial. What's not to like?<br /><br />I hate to write anything negative because I don't want to discourage development of any products that avoid HFCS. But. to be honest. The Switch Orange Tangerine doesn't smell very good. If you're familiar with Airborne Cold Remedy. well. it smells like that. I think I was expecting a fragrance like Tang instant beverage. I certainly didn't expect it to smell like it does. It's not all that bad. it's just not real good.<br /><br />I also think this product would actually taste better if it weren't carbonated.<br /><br />The calories are about the same as a typical soda. But they're fruit juice calories instead of HFCS. so that's a big plus in my book.
6644,B001LG945O,A1JXLM6TYINCBA,D. Doyle,0/0,1245888000,Good stuff,Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.  I'd say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale. this one's about an 11.<br /><br />At 26 grams. it's still a lot of sugar (mostly from apple and grape juice. I think).  I'll order a case just 'cuz I thought it was good and I'm calling it 4 stars - but honestly. I'd rather have it 50% splenda or stevia sweetened.
6647,B001LG945O,A3FY3H6F4249E0,Kathy W,0/0,1245888000,Orange-Tangerine Carbonated Fruit Drink,I didn't really like the taste of this product much.  It has an artificial taste to me. even though it is juice and water.  It is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin. although not quite that bad.  I did drink the whole can.  The 8.3 oz can is narrow. compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing.<br /><br />The can says it is 100% juice. 100% RDA Vitamin C. all natural with no sugar added. no corn syrup. no preservatives. no artificial colors. and gluten free.  The nutrition box indicates (for the entire 8.3 oz can) 15mg sodium. 36g carbs. 34 g sugar. Vitamin C 100 %. Vitamin A 20%.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order: 100% juice (filtering sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates. apple. grape. tangerine. orange and acerola juice concentrates). gum acacia. natural flavors and colors. ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Contains soy. (First ingredient listed is supposed to be the one there is the most of.)<br /><br />You may wonder why I spent so much time on the ingredients.  Well. if you don't read labels. you really should start.  Some products may taste really good but may be full of nasty things you really do not want your children to eat (or yourself).  The term. gluten free. for example is VERY important to those who have gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and I would have liked to have given this flavor a better review. but the taste was not there for me.  The black cherry flavor has a lot better taste.<br /><br />Still. if you are looking for a seemingly healthier beverage to pack in your child's lunch. this could be worth a try.  Think of it as a flavored carbonated water.  I gave it 3 stars because it is not unhealthy and it is not bad - just not something I like the taste of.<br /><br />I would sooner put this product in a child's lunch than a soda.  My daddy used to put soda on the car's battery terminals to dissolve the acid :-(
6659,B001LG945O,A1FHWJ7EFO3E3U,J. McKnite,0/0,1245801600,Not for me,It may be all natural but it didn't have a natural taste to me.  The can size is small and the calories were more than I thought there should be.  I like the mild carbonation ok but I wouldn't switch from orange juice.
6661,B001LG945O,A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE,D. Greenbaum DoctorDave,0/0,1245801600,Fruity and bubbly. not so orangy,I liked it!<br /><br />Didn't know what to expect.  It has a variety of fruit juices such as apple. orange and grape. but clearly had a strong orange taste.  I liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as HFC or sugar.  I'm not a pop/soda drinker. but I think if I served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a 2 liter people wouldn't notice the difference.<br /><br />It's a bit pricy for orange soda and I'm sure orange juice would be better. but if you are looking for something healthier. this one's for you.
6697,B001LG945O,A3K93OWHKHGI9V,Water Monkey Marc B.,0/0,1238371200,Good tasting orange soda,I enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda.  It was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it.  I am glad it does not have any HFCS in it. but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars.  All in all. if you are looking for a good orange soda. try this one.
6700,B001LG945O,A1MRRMHGV3PN5W,Stacie L. Helsing stacielc,0/0,1237939200,Great flavor.,This has great flavor. but I am not sure it would be a soda alternate.  I am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work!  Tastes great. but I really did not get the carbonation kick I get from a soda.
6731,B001LG945O,A37USOKUTI724H,Donna Capshaw Grandma,0/0,1237334400,sickening sweet,I could not finish this drink. it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst!
6737,B001LG945O,A1ZBGFVVMDPOPD,Mr. Fantastic,0/0,1236816000,good. ok. maybe,This one tasted pretty good.  Very tangy. but in a 'real fruit' kind of way.  I think they got this one right.  I still can't ever see myself buying a bunch of this.  Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try. I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).<br /><br />I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all. I would want way more. at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks. and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.  I guess there is a market for that. I'm just not part of it.<br /><br />Nice little carbonated juice. but still not really worth the effort/money for me.
6764,B001LG945O,A3NLJZI5NEOT0K,Linda Pagliuco katknit,0/0,1235865600,Refreshing,Fruit juice has lots of calories. so at home. we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice. We like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink. The Switch is a portable alternative - a little carbonation. nice flavor. more like tangerine than orange. and 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin C. When convenience is important. The Switch is a good. healthier alternative to soda.
6765,B001LG945O,A55PK06Q6AKFY,ephemeral,0/0,1235865600,Great Alternative to Soda,I really liked this drink.  It provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly-sweet. sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind.  Despite containing apple and grape juice. it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises.  If you're looking for a carbonated juice. I'd definitely suggest this.  I'll be drinking it again.
6778,B001LG945O,A18FUHNBP90IB4,cb,0/0,1235692800,Was not a hit at our house...,My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.
6787,B001LG945O,A2J8DE8R94ZB02,Truth Teller,0/0,1235606400,I loved it!,I loved it! Good taste. pleasant carbonation. fun can.<br /><br />Ok. so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal. right?  But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience.  I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However. this drink has no sugar. corn syrup. or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you. but you gotta live a little.
6804,B001LG945O,A2WPO2NR9FIWR2,ScrabbleMaven,0/0,1235520000,Not so good,The can says it's 100% juice. but the taste is ...powdery.  If you've ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light. you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.<br /><br />I did not like it.
6805,B001LG945O,A3D9BTRM4JOU41,Ernest Friedman-Hill JavaRanch Sheriff,0/0,1235520000,Delicious,This is a nice. light. refreshing carbonated fruit juice. It's something like Orangina. but far more natural-tasting -- which makes sense. because unlike Orangina. it's all juice and has no added sweetener.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the 8.3 ounce can is rather small; I generally prefer a larger drink. It's definitely not a bargain if you have to drink two cans at a time.
6816,B001LG945O,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,audrey,0/0,1235433600,tangy orange-y bubbly stuff .... yum!,I like carbonated fruit juices and I think this one is fine.  It has a more tangy formula than the name suggests; it's more of a light fruit punch.  It's refreshing and a good serving size. in my opinion.  It's wonderful to have something that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup!  What's here instead is: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates. apple. grape. tangerine. orange and acerola juice concentrates). gum acacia. natural flavors and colors. ascorbic acid (vitamin c). contains soy.  Delicious.  Sweet.  Light.  Fruity.  Tangy.  Yum.
6834,B001LG945O,A1VYFEJM12ZP11,Jana Taylor,1/1,1246147200,Very harsh. too-sweet flavor.,I was anxious to try this. but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness. the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.<br /><br />I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim no additional sugar this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams.
6838,B001LG945O,A3I1BJIFFM4S21,Atomicwasteland,1/2,1246147200,This is really good. especially if you like 100% juice,I really enjoyed this drink.  It tasted just like an orange soda. but I liked it more because it was 100% juice. and didn't have any extra additives.<br /><br />The only negative is that since it is 100% juice (and has no artificial sweeteners) it is high in calories -140 calories to a can. to be exact.<br /><br />However. if I were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice. I definitely would drink this as a treat.  Plus. it would be really fun to pack in a cooler. especially for the young ones in your family.<br /><br />Please note. it is not just a single type of juice.  It is a blend of several juices. so it is not carbonated OJ. it is something just a little different.
6854,B001LG945O,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,Kimba W. Lion kimbawlion.com,2/4,1235606400,Tastes like soap.,This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.<br /><br />What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.
6860,B001LG945O,A374MNR8XKAC5E,raeve,0/1,1249430400,Too sweet!,I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course. tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy. ultra sweet drink. not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty.
6870,B001LG945O,A3U52V5ZAHZZKU,Wayne Crenwelge teacher,0/1,1246060800,Powerful little drink,Four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink.  It tasted good to all four people. and agreement from all four is difficult.  It does not taste like a soft drink. but much better.  If you are looking for a fiz that is tart. this is your drink.
6874,B001LG945O,A8KJS2P6E5DCB,T. Distaso,0/1,1245888000,A nice alternative to soda,This product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine.<br />It also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet.<br />Not lingering or noticeable aftertaste.
6882,B001LG945O,A27D0VRNOOUNRR,Steph booklover,0/1,1235520000,Crisp. and suprisingly sweet drink. but lots of calories AND pricey,I really enjoyed the Switch.  It was a lot more carbonated than most sodas and stayed that way until I finished it.  I was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp. tangerine taste.  It was similar to Sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice.  I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative. you might want to give it a try. but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isn't exactly a diet drink.  And the price for the Switch is about 4 times the cost of most soft drinks so I think it would be out of the range for most people's pockets.
6890,B001LG945O,A2B3A8NQIHITO8,P. Costello,1/4,1258588800,Ok Soda--like slightly lugubrious tang in a can.,How can tang be lugubrious?  If you made it a bit watered down. a bit more aftertasty. a bit less child-friendly.  It's an all right soda. but I don't feel the thrill of drinking it that I did drinking tang as a child.  I can't pretend I'm an astronaut with this.  Sometimes. advertising just helps.
6893,B001LG945O,A1PW5SQLR0Z6IH,Natalie S ns65,0/0,1240444800,Not bad at all,The Switch Orange Tangerine. 8.3 Ounce can packs a big punch in a teeny tiny can. Touted as a healthy alternative to soda. I couldn't help but taste the similarity between Switch and Coke's Fanta orange drink. The difference however is more than plain. Switch is supposedly 100% carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars. It actually has a pretty good taste -- if it is all natural. then I think kids would love it. I liked the carbonation -- it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it. All in all. I would buy this product again.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine
6906,B001LG945O,AOODNGLAEDN76,Robert H. Knox,1/1,1245715200,Strange...,On the face of it. THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. It's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar. preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring. gum acacia. ascorbic acid (i.e.. Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities. it's priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent. right?<br /><br />The trouble is: it just doesn't taste that good to me. There is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that I can't imagine many people warming up to. Perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can. Perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; it's something I haven't tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks. I really don't know. but I do know that I won't be drinking any more of it in the near future.
6927,B001LG945O,A1JDDX70A0XUFO,shivatrance,0/0,1280102400,Great Orange Bevvie,Seriously a great orange drink on par with Orangina without being super crazy sweet.  I have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the Vine program. Also! Goes great with vodka or tequila!

It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.<br /><br />The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.<br /><br />Overall. this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.<br /><br />Not bad. but not what I want.
6945,B001LG945O,A16YU3GRGCD95S,Theresa M. Studer Terra57,0/0,1247443200,Really Not Too Bad,I usually drink my soda room temperature but with this one I really needed it to be cold.  The taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda.  There was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as I'm concered and it wasn't exceedingly sweet.  I would most certainly consider getting this again as I don't think it's all that bad.  It's nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor.

7000,B004K30HO2,A3UK9UHISO0YZX,Sherizig,0/0,1319673600,Perfect! Works as expected,This product worked exactly as advertised. I filled several cups in advance with my own coffee and was able to use them in my machine just like a K-Cup. Prior to purchasing. I read a review stating that the lid came off when the user was attempting to remove it from the machine. This was not the case for me. The lid was secure and it functioned just like the more expensive prefilled K-Cup. I will order these DisposaKups regularly.
7022,B004K30HO2,A14N3D9Y4AMH8P,canoer canoer,0/0,1316217600,work fine. make great coffee. but w/o true saving,These work just fine after spooning ground coffee into a series of these cups (do it over a plate with ground coffee in a small bowl). Doing so. you get just the fine coffee you want and are not trapped by the standard selections. But there's no saving money: $14/lb coffee works out to 25 cents per cup plus the 25 cents per DisposaKup gives 50 cents per cup. about the price of regular k-cups. Darn! Hoped I'd save money but I do get my choice.
7030,B004K30HO2,A9LMTG47CVCIG,Cecilia M. Isaacs,0/0,1315267200,excellent product,I love these DisposaKups. They allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my Keurig coffee maker. There is no mess. easy as using the regular K kups. just throw away when you are done making your coffee. LOVE the convenience. I have just place a 2nd order.

7036,B004K30HO2,A3GWKF4W7WLG13,JYeakel,0/0,1313366400,I love DisposaKups!,This product works just as described!  You simply place a filter in the disposable cup. add your own coffee. snap on the lid. and make the cup of coffee as you would with a regular K Cup.  The coffee is just as good as any prepackaged K Cups. and you can use the brand of your choice at a fraction of the cost (and no washing out those pesky mesh reusable filters!) As some other reviewers have noted. sometimes the cup gets stuck on the handle that raises as you are trying to remove the used cup.  But you simply pull it out and I've never had a lid fall of. so there is still no mess.  I will definitely continue to use this product!
7037,B004K30HO2,A26QLSYFZ5DCLB,ZayZay kaplan142,0/0,1312848000,Makes Keurig more convenient,I was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup. The solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type. The filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids. It is easy to use and does what it says.

Shipping was fast and they are a good value in my opinion . Thanks

7086,B004K30HO2,ALW0AGFAXVJTJ,BLTMAN,2/10,1299715200,Neat concept,Neat concept. Other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the K-Cup. This is like a do it yourself K-Cup. However. because this consists of a disposable cup. filter. and a cap and is punched by the brewer. I would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on Keurig's patents. Oh. and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website :)
7093,B004K30HO2,ASTZPWLPHEVKJ,Linda Ratcliff MickeynDallas,4/5,1310169600,Not worth the trouble,First of all. I thought I could save money filling my own Keurig K-Cups. By the time I bought the fillable cups. paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them. I was already in the hole.<br />If all you have to do is fill these little cups all day I guess it will work for you. because you can have the coffee of your choice. The other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out.<br />I still have about thirty left. and when they are gone I will not replace them.
7098,B004K30HO2,ADFQ22E8V739D,M. Tannacore,1/1,1330300800,Can you say. leak?,My sister bought a Keurig. We all started using it. But mom still had her cans of coffee. I didn't want them to go to waste. so I bought this figuring I could make her k-cups with her own coffee. The cups are flimsy. first of all (most of them buckle too easily while getting the top on). It *looks* like a good seal (and yes. I made sure there were no coffee grounds on the edge. which I know can screw up the seal). but they still leak. Get one of the reusable cups. It'll be better for you and your Keurig.
7103,B004K30HO2,ACDJDU3VK01QI,Sharon I. Clark Nana,1/1,1328400000,Great product,The pods worked as described.  I did not have overflows. I found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. Wish they were sold in larger quantities
7115,B004K30HO2,A1U0QKJ52MSS56,Shirley,1/1,1308182400,Better,These cups are simple and easy to use the only drawback is the fact that maybe 1/3 of the cups get caught in the unit when you open. However. they are easy to remove once you just close and reopen.
7116,B004K30HO2,A2C442KVL5DEG8,Rachel McGranahan,1/1,1305244800,Makes a great cup of Joe,It is just like a k-cup...no ground left in the bottom of my coffee.  Makes a strong. hot cup of Joe.  The cup melts to the shape of your coffee maker.  It works wonderfully. but when i did the math for saving a few bucks...the whole reason i went looking for an alternative...it is just about the same as buying the prepackaged cups (i try to buy the K-cups around $28). except you can choose your own coffee and YOU have to measure it out.  Now i have not used all 50 cups yet so i will see if some of my coffee is left over and then it might be a little cheaper. The breakdown... $18 dollars for the disposable cups (shipping included). and $10 for my favorite coffee + time to fill the cups + environmentally wasteful = We need a better solution.  The reusable filters received mixed reviews. but i might give it a shot.
7117,B004K30HO2,A1NFUA27YNWQCP,Janice Holland O'Keefe,5/7,1315180800,Real BAD idea,These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
7155,B004K30HO2,A1N04DQVSX07IC,Kidia,0/0,1326931200,Much Better than I anticipated,I really wasn't too sure this product would work.  It has surpassed all my expectations.  I will never buy the ready made K cups again.  This is truly a genius product!
7168,B000LKYVZE,A1U8VNED7UE10V,Jay,4/4,1292198400,A nice organic option,The candy is ordinary milk chocolate. but I was very glad to have an organic option to hand out for Halloween. I love the idea of including a little nature education with it. but I was a little disappointed in the text on the insect card I saw. which was not well written and had almost nothing to do with the moth that was pictured. But it's more than you get with most candy.

The chocolate melts in your mouth revealing the perfect raisin inside.  You can let them sit in your mouth and savor the moment. or chew through two quickly before throwing more in your mouth - I usually do the latter.<br /><br />I've never been able to find a comparable milk chocolate raisin product so I always end up coming back to these.  They're sold at big discount warehouses and also on Amazon.  Perfect.

7222,B001RIXUS8,ALKV96Z02Q18U,Dar,0/0,1336262400,Not bad. not great.... just average.,I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality. and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans. but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there.

My favorite flavors would have to be apple and blueberry.  I was curious to try the grapefuit one though because someone told me it tastes like fresca. and I love fresca.  I tried it and in no way does it taste like fresca. its much milder then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all.  I found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest.  I have not tried the peach one yet but I am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one:D lol  Oh well. I am just not a big fan of peach drinks.  If you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this. its very smooth.  I dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite. I like my drink to have a bite to it.  It is ok. but I will stick to blueberry and apple from now on. The really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice. all natural and no added sugar. and each glass bottle has 2 servings of fruit. you cant beat that.

7271,B00382UXU4,AWYOLS02KZYE6,Nicholas K. Turner,0/0,1338681600,Returning Customer!,This is great popcorn!!!  I just purchased a second batch.  I never had a problem w/a ton of kernels left in my air popper or many hulls.  As long as this is being produced and sold I will be a buyer!<br /><br />The only con I have is that the only seal on the canister is a small piece of tape on the lid/canister.  I was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle.  Surprisingly though I had no issues with humidity effecting the corn (maybe because I'm in a dryer climate?).
7272,B00382UXU4,A1ASD6B9ZDLDEE,MJC,0/0,1337040000,Works great with Microwave Popper,I ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection-two brands.  One of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels.  No taste.<br /><br />I mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls.  I noticed that 1/3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands I have tried.  It kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine.  When using microwave poppers. you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn.  The snappy burnt kernels didn't taste as bad as other brands.<br /><br />This white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil.

7294,B0000V1B4I,A1M09HETLCY39B,Holly,5/5,1186704000,Great Tea but need a filter!,I love this tea and have no complaints!!!  I just want to comment on how the tea is packaged.  It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.

7300,B0000V1B4I,A2D37TPGMT91GQ,Rene J. Depontbriand rdepontb,1/1,1227484800,Almost perfect!,This is a dual review. as it has to be.  The first part covers the delicious. needs-nothing-else China Mist iced tea varieties included in this box.  Each of 24 packets contains four ounces of the world's choicest tea leaves. with stellar flavorings mixed in (dried. crushed mango; dried. crushed passion fruit; dried. crushed raspberry; pure. strong tea).<br /><br />My first experience with it was at a restaurant where our daughter works.  She said. Order the iced tea. Dad. you won't need to put any sugar or lemon or anything into it (always looking out for my diabetes).  It was fantastic. nearly the highlight of my meal. which itself was outstanding.  I asked the manager if he could share the tea secret:  Well. we use the industry's best. China Mist!  Everybody says it's the best they've had!  Indeed.<br /><br />The flavor was. if you'll pardon me. complex and could be rated as you would a nice wine--action. hints of this or that. a new rush at the end of your taste cycle.  It made me think what I'd been missing; this tasted like what the British must drink. the full-bodied teas they enjoy.  Apparently Americans add as much extra water to our tea as we do to our coffee (What the French hear when we order a java over there:  I'll have coffee. with a cup of water on top).<br /><br />The second part of the review concerns our Hamilton Beach iced tea machine.  We add the recommend water and ice cubes. and the brewing cycle indeed does take only 10 minutes.  The tea is already ice cold.  It may be the difference between a home-level heat limit. or maybe the fact that the water is not pressured over the tea as much as it might be in a commercial machine. or maybe the commercial machines are much better insulated around the steeping container.  Our Hamilton Beach unit made a weaker tea than I would have liked; we'll reduce the amount of water from now on and see what that does.  In fairness. the Bamilton Beach Iced Tea make was $22.49; commercial models are $600 or more. but they brew their stronger teas in only 8 (versus 10) minutes.  A wildly expensive two minutes.
7301,B0000V1B4I,A6IFJIX69Z1HY,Elon Smith Elon,0/0,1314057600,Excellent product,I purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea. When I find the flavor I like I will probably buy a case of it. China mist tea taste great. As for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea don't worry. I went to the local supermarket (HEB in Texas) and found empty tea bags in a box for about $5.They work great. Fill with tea and fold top and staple.

I was somewhat confused thinking how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club? But. with having given and received numerous of the month clubs and having all great experiences in the past. I was curious to see what they had put together here. Needless to say. WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all. but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato. After a single bite. my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had. and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having velvet wrapping around your body. The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl. Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream. and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of. I highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you'll want to find more of once you're done!
7372,B000MJKZ0O,A2J57BVV3UGCLX,holmessteve,0/0,1348790400,Be Wary of AmazingClubs Ice Cream of the Month Club,I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams. such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip. in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't meet their quality guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs. the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their support group (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club.
7373,B001EPQQL2,AOJKV6V6K21FW,J L Davis,6/6,1253232000,Great low calorie sweetner!,I use this in all my recipes calling for brown sugar.  As per the INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE. use ONE-HALF the amount called for in the recipe. If the recipe states ONE CUP of brown sugar. you use ONLY ONE-HALF cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I am not a diabetic but I do have many family members who are and this is a great substitute for real brown sugar. even though it does contain part Splenda and part real brown sugar.
7381,B001EPQQL2,A13QM0HT6VXHL5,mean incognito monkey,0/0,1350259200,yummy good substitute for brown sugar,This is a most excellent sugar substitute for those who watch their sugar intake.<br /><br />BUT!!! (and this is important because one does tend to follow recipes to a fault) you must use half as much as the recipe calls for. which btw. does not work as well as you'd hope.  It's just not nearly as sweet cup for cup.<br /><br />I make that up using extra Splenda white because I use brown sugar for it's sweetness as well as the molasses flavor.  This is why I will only give it four stars....because they COULD make it cup for cup by doing what I do and adding more Splenda white so a baker could follow their recipe and not give it a second thought.  Heaven knows they're charging enough for it.<br /><br />I'm sure you know this:  Brown sugar is unrefined or molasses sugar.  You can make your own brown sugar by adding 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses to 1 cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork. It comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has.  (and how much extra sugar too)<br /><br />Splenda brown sugar blend as it is. is a very coarsely granulated Splenda. a little coarser than Splenda white.  So the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own.  So for convenience. you can't beat Splenda brown sugar blend.  The Splenda brand is superior (in my opinion) to the store brands that are popping up but YMMV. and your store might have a really good version.<br /><br />Still...and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on Splenda. for texture. for flavor and consistency.  When you bake. that counts for a lot in my book.

Mojo. both love the lamb what we refer to as doggie cookie bones.<br />They're finally accepting the need to go out onto our five scrub acres to relieve themselves<br />with help of the Pro Plan Biscuits with Real Lamb as a reward.  We use the small ones as Jack<br />tends to overeat and Mojo weighs less than 20 lbs. This one item added to their daily menu has<br />made a huge difference in our household. reducing the mama's not happy time to about zilch!
7443,B005HVDZRM,A1QU5WEF3LS9YD,Frog,0/0,1351123200,Twinings---a good cup of tea,I have been drinking Twining's tea for years.  It used to be made in England but now they have a plant in North Carolina for the American trade.  The tea is excellent. I drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.
7451,B007NVJ4CY,ALZI0ZF3NOSKU,Texas Boomer,0/0,1333238400,Good Medium Roast,I have recently purchased the Vue by Kurig and I must say my initial impressions are very positive. The new design provides a better cup of coffee. Having used Green Mountain Nantucket Breakfast Blend before. I was presented with a very good cup of coffee. It is actually stronger and better flavored than the original. The brewing system must contribute to the difference. If you like medium roast coffee as your morning wake me up than you should give this a try assuming you are going to use it in the new Vue machine.
7464,B00769ZSVO,A1MYVFHB5ALR6M,mistrin,0/0,1330732800,Tasty and Healthy,Yeah these are very tastely and healthy. but the price here is ridculously high at $18.  Not sure I understand why since Amazon is just referring you to 180snacks.com. where you can't find the Almond Pops. but you can buy them!  So. if you search Almond Pops with Blueberries at Google it will take you to the 180 site and you can add them to your cart!  I e-mailed them and they said their site is under contruction.  I'm about to try and order from them directly.  Hope it works out since it's hard to find tasty and healthy snacks.

I so often find myself stuck in traffic just when my blood sugar starts to drop.  Add the stress of being late to my next appointment and I'm a basket case!  Grandpa Po's is the perfect snack to take on the road.  Not too salty or sweet. they  satisfy that need to nosh without feeling gross. I even feel fortified!  Plus they come in this nifty zip-lock bag that keeps them fresh even if I leave them in my car for a couple of days.  I never want to be caught in traffic without them!
7479,B000143ZK2,A3UQZSHG14LC5A,E. A. Hayes,1/1,1223596800,Grandpa Po's are Majorly Addictive,Outstanding!  DElicious!  What on earth are these things? Simple. They're a yummy mix of nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic dry roasted soybeans. They're so delicious your head may actually explode once you taste them. Slightly Unsalted. but majorly addictive. these crunchy snacks are good for you.
7483,B000143ZK2,ALLP9NX7Z081M,Caryl J. Caryl,1/1,1222732800,Grandpa Po's Originals are deliciously addicting,These are a great grab and go snack that satisfy.  I love pop corn but don't eat it that much because my husband hates my breath while I am eating it at the movies. so I take Grandpa Po's Originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag!  I know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way I enjoy to eat them.  I love these!!!
7493,B00170WH12,A3S1EB6OSBUPHL,Anonymous,0/0,1340150400,Color was not Ruby Red,The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink. not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways. and as a relative beginner. I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to paint it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end. because the red color was important for the cake. I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color. not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end. I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was. I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.

7512,B0001M0Z3O,A15AX7PWR2HZE7,John Paul L. Finan,1/1,1303171200,This cayenne pepper is as advertised: hot!,I have no idea what a heat unit is. and I kind of doubt Frontier does either. but hey - the proof is in the spicy. And this works. One teaspoon makes four quarts of chili nice and toasty. and two tsp make it killer hot. My local Outpost co-op food store carries Frontier brand spices. and Outpost doesn't sell crap. so I'm satisfied they operate responsibly.

7518,B000OIWY8Y,A2OS04I7N83D5K,Grace Brunelle Halal Silks,6/6,1262908800,ADDICTIVELY FANTASTIC!!,Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly.the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew. it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty. caramel with vanilla notes. it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends.let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag. it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor. but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection. I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!!<br />Lana Please keep on creating this tea. I am definitely coming back for more.<br />And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw. i am sipping this as i write.. YUM!<br />smiles. grace in VT

And it's cut in just the right size pieces for spreading: not too lumpy or too 'jammy.'<br /><br />I've wasted so money on so many different preserves. I eat a few teaspoon-fulls. usually find them too sweet. then they sit in the 'frige until I finally throw them away. This brand. I ate all of in just about 2 months which is really fast. for me. It stayed in edible condition in the fridge up to the last spoonful.<br /><br />Amazon is listing four bottles. each containing 1 pound of preserve. so each bottle costs about $5.50 plus shipping.

7584,B000CQ6KSI,A3CXC8SO2JO7OQ,DC Vision,0/0,1340323200,Love Annie's,I am a big fan of anything Annie's so it is no surprise I give these 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between 'the chessiest' and the truly chessiest mac & cheese - which is Annie's. I enjoy the white cheddar the most.
7589,B000CQ6KSI,A107RA9MLD5HQ0,A. Stults,0/0,1202083200,All natural. but bland,It's all natural. no artificial color. no weird ingredients . . . but it also has no taste. The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch. then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese. stick with homemade.
7596,B000FJZB64,A1OKMWKTNUJ6L2,Bridget Young YoungMomof2,2/3,1204675200,Good quality - not 'getting' whatever flavor difference...,I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes. you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt. but for the use I had in mind. grinding on food. it does not work.
7607,B0028GY93S,A11EELLPLULTY8,eMi,0/0,1348444800,High Quality that shows,I had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy.<br />She has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase. And as many of you know.  it is hard to find good food.<br />I have ordered 3 small bags of different food/brands. this one was the first on the list to try.<br /><br />After 2 days. the coat of my dog got better and softer too. I would have not thought that it would work so fast.<br />Poop stayed solid (I didn't have a problem with that on the previous food. but its important) and it doesn't have a nasty smell anymore. as with the previous food. Great again!<br />She still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and I am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition.<br /><br />***After 4 days. the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable. This food is high quality and it shows on your dog. We also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food. I recommend this food over Acana. Orijen or other foods with high protein levels. as it is grain free!!! (very important).<br /><br />As for the price. Amazon is a fabulous website (& I do have Prime). however I was able to get 2 bags for $39.94/bag WITH shipping included on another website! And as I am typing this. I got additional on time 10% off .. so not even with Prime I would be able to get to that price.<br /><br />Anyway. as far as the food goes. it is very very good. Just be careful with the high protein levels. not all dogs might do well with it. Get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food. If it doesn't work (lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more). try a different brand with less protein. You might want to look at Precise Holistic. Fromm Gold or Canidea alternatives. Very good foods but the protein is lower. Get small bags. try one. mix in little by little. if it doesn't work. go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag.<br /><br />In case of questions I will be happy to help.<br /><br />***UPDATE: So after about two weeks of use. the coat is shinier as EVER. its absolutely beautiful. The last time I remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy. There is a little gas now and than. but nothing horrible (and I do feed my dog at night. so her stomach works during the night). stool is solid and still no smell. I also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears. food CAN cause ear and eye infection. so that is satisfying too. As for the shedding. it has almost stopped. Its 80% better!!!<br /><br />This is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months. We have tried around 10-12 different brands. That gives you an idea of how good it is. Also. it is ridiculously cheap. if you know. where to buy it. This food. under $40! is without a doubt. the best food money can buy. Well. at least for us it is.
7635,B000TRFGGM,A2RIOP2NTT6KD,Laura Sondej,1/1,1276560000,Good plant,I was very pleased with my venus fly trap when I received it.  It was in good shape and came very quickly.  We have been having a lot of fun feeding it bugs.
7636,B000TRFGGM,A1JCPN2Q0XVAGP,Mark O'Brien,3/4,1294704000,Dead on Arrival,The plant arrived dead.  It cost as much to ship.  I did not want to hassle with any kind of return.  I should know better than to buy a plant on line.

7660,B000TRFGGM,A37B2NWW52BB1J,Alecia,0/2,1317772800,I killed the plant,I received the plant in great condition but soon killed it. The directions said not to fertalize it and exactly what to plant it in. So. I bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid gro in it so it died within 3 days. My seven year old loved it while he had it though. He even named it. fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet!
7665,B004ASGJ5S,A3UCN2RGY7O6S1,"Joanne Gotta Eat, Gotta Cook",3/3,1329609600,Love it--and allergen free,This is one of the few canned sauces without citric acid. Their canned ground tomatoes I use all the time for sauce. better than imported San Marzano. and I am an Italian-American.  I know my sauce.  This can be found in some local supermarkets. here in NY it is in ShopRite. BestYet. and in larger cans at Sam's Club for under $4 for a HUGE 6 lb. can! In supermarkets. I bought it recently at $1 for a 15 oz. can on sale. regularly priced under $2 for a 15 oz. can.  Look for it and try it. Nice and thick and tasty as it should be.  An additional bonus for me personally is that it contains no food allergens such as dairy. eggs. or nuts.  Safe for my granddaughter who is allergic.
7668,B004ASGJ5S,A3AOMIFPURQB7D,Guges,0/0,1322784000,Just like I remebered!,I grew up in NJ and the local Italian food store sold this sauce along with dough and cheese that you could take home to make your own pizza! I loved it then. and I love it now.  The only issue is the price.  At almost 4$ per can it would be hard to justify the cost.  So to be clear. 5 stars for the sauce. but 1 star for the price!
7693,B001E5DZTS,A3KZLIEGCSSM5L,1104 Sublime Siren,2/2,1325894400,use it all the time,i get horrible gas. stomach pain and loose stools if I drink a glass of cow milk or eat in cereal. I have tried lactase pills and special milk with no results.<br /><br /> I use this instead and have none of those symptoms.  Measure into your mixing bowl. cup. pitcher. etc. and SLOWLY mix in HOT water. As soon as it's paste. you can add cold water.  Doing it this way prevents clumping.<br /><br />I like it and add JUST A TOUCH of sugar or other sweetner & kids can't tell the difference between this and cow milk.  I use 1 TBS of unsulphured. blackstrap molasses per 16oz milk. It turns the milk light brown (think iced coffee) but my family doesn't mind. We like the way it tastes and appreciate the extra iron. calcium and potassium from the molasses (has to be unsulphured. blackstrap). This type has only 11g carbs per TBSP. I use slighty less powder than recommended (3 scoops for 16oz instead of the recommended 4). This helps to weaken the goat flavor.
7725,B001E5DZTS,A213OIMAP56C0M,Mommy,0/0,1347062400,Great item!!,Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.
7748,B001E5DZTS,A1RPS599JUG56G,ECT,0/0,1287878400,Love it!,This is a really good source for goats milk. I found this online at Amazon and it is the least expensive price I've found. I order it regularly.

My daughter loves it and it is easier for her to digest and has been known to lesson the occurance of certain allergies in children in given in place of whole milk that is recommended up 'til age 2.  This is my second child that I am using it with and I love it and so do they.
7757,B001E5DZTS,A2VF19SK23PMCF,Latose Intolerant,1/2,1330473600,Life Altering Milk,I do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance.  Remembering that I had liked goat milk when I had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country.  I started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know. it was.  Yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk. but being able to have it again has been a blessing.  Thank you Mayenberg for both the powdered and evaporated milk.  Thank you Amazon for offering it a price that is not breaking my purse.
7758,B001E5DZTS,A33AQPJYH7UUXR,Desert Gypsy A Brooklyn Girl Out West,1/2,1319328000,a little sour but great for baking with,I don't find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form; I've had fresh goat milk and frankly. this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form. It does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use. Certain bread. pancakes and the like do very well if I add this mix instead of other milks or water. Good to have in the pantry for those just-in case days.
7759,B001E5DZTS,A2LONQYAJ65E8F,Lucy Tovar mom of two bubs,1/2,1196985600,great product!,My baby is allergic to cow's milk and this is so much cheaper and better than the hypoallergenic formula.  He loves this stuff!
7762,B001E5DZTS,AOROWFJIZTKSB,GoJohnnyGoGoGoGo,2/7,1327363200,Lacks modern chemicals,This stuff apparently has a shelf life of many weeks. even after opening. And it tastes ok in tea and coffee. once you get used to it. which is more than I can say for soy milk.<br /><br />But. I give it just 4 stars because it's so hard to mix. Now. if they added some modern chemicals to allow easier mixing. even if it caused an allergic reaction. I still wouldn't vote for Newt Gingrich.
7770,B00579RB42,AJ1ELAPIRYLKD,T,0/0,1347494400,It's alright.,I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted. it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot. however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me.

Don't buy it!!,I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.<br />However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different. but additionally tastes really<br />horrible... believe me. I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.<br />In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space. probably soon they'll go to the waste bascket.<br /><br />It's sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close. but totally a disappointment.

And. the wild rice adds just a bit of yummy crunch.  For some reason I think it's way better than the chicken noodle one.  If you eat strictly organic. it's perfect for when you don't have time to make a fresh meal.

Lentils are one of the planet's top 10 super foods. extremely high in protein and fiber. extremely low on the glycemic index and inflammation scale. This is one food I try to eat everyday. I live in a pretty unsophisticated town in the central valley of California. and you'd think our high-end supermarket. Raley's. would carry organic lentils. but of course. they don't. and even if they did. I'd have to pay an arm and leg for them. Amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products. Incidentally. I don't make the typical lentil soup with these. I simply cook one bag (16 oz.) with about 7.5 cups of non-fluoridated bottled water (fluoride is extremely bad for your thyroid). salt them to taste. and only cook them for 25 minutes. This way. they don't get mushy. They keep their firmness without being too chewy. more like a bean. and then I keep them in the fridge for a week. and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top. YUMMY!

It has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful. In fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg. Changing to Annamaet grainless Salcha.which is small kibbles. from the old food does take a gradual process for the older dogs not because of its size. but because of its high quality. Lastly the company has never had a recall on its products. something we all look for today.
7914,B00166D8TW,A29WOWF7GNCTBR,JV Chicago Shopper,1/1,1307750400,Low calorie. high protein. great taste,I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions. otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually). and whey protein is a dairy product. which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.
7917,B00166D8TW,A16FEH35RTWBPH,jdogb1,0/0,1347494400,The Best Protein Out There,In my opinion. this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products. from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech). BSN. many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research. talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok. but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good. and the protein is not bad. but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy. whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product. and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there. many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency. while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these. this is precisely why whey is so cheap. and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive. but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture. I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used. and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of Metabolic whey that I tried. it is still sitting in the back room.

7933,B000RHXIGO,A588PNX5REE8P,Patrick D. Hairr,9/9,1260489600,Everything I expected,For years I have grown my own habaneros to dry. crush and use for cooking.  I have been unable to do so for the last two years because of a job relocation.  My supply from previous years had run out so I purchased this product to re-supply.<br /><br />I have been tremendously satisfied.  Great quality. great consistency. great heat. good color. good particulate size. good price.<br /><br />Without any reservation would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a good habanero powder.<br /><br />Be warned though... It is not for the faint of heart.
7936,B000RHXIGO,A3OE4F7VLS8GXB,greencat,2/2,1307404800,Sweet pain,Been buying ground Habanero from American Spice for years. decided to try someone else with their price going up-up-up. and not satisfied with consistency of heat.  This stuff had the right flavor and more heat than anything beside fresh. it will make you sweat.  Better price and value than any Habanero experience in 20 years of buying the stuff. will buy from this vendor again.
7942,B000RHXIGO,ANY6WUENN4DH0,Hesse,0/0,1338595200,Kick a$$ habanero pepper powder,This stuff is the bomb.<br />There is no pepper that has a tastier fruity flavor than the Habanero.  The fact that is fiery hot is both a bonus. (for us heat lovers) and a curse(for the wussies).<br />I use this stuff all the time.  Sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato. sprinkle it over some Mexican sour cream for a dip.  Sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad.  The uses are near endless.<br /><br />Also if you wanted to use it in lieu of mace or pepper spray. a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly induces excitement.<br />Be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff. if you get a smal puff of it into your nose. you will most definately know about it.  ;-P

A few years ago I was forced to switch to decaf tea. Most of the blends available are terrible. I used to drink regular Yorkshire tea. and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong. full-bodied tea. and I love it! I decided to purchase from Amazon because I knew I could count on them. as  well  as their outside vendors. I was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again.

Time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from CHINA.  Do NOT buy treats made in China for your pets!  Sure. these are a tad more expensive. but in the long run it will save you money by not having vet bills and save the health of your pet!  I call it kitty and dog candy!  They come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open.  They LOVE Bravo's real meat treats!

The only downside is the size. I understand this was a strip. but I use them as regular bite-size treats and therefore had to break them into bits by hand (took me a while). I wish Amazon sold bite-size roast chicken treats by this company. I feel good about giving them to the cat. as it seems most cat treats are loaded with bad stuff.

8014,B004SISLQ0,A28RLTVE9YJBPW,Ronald Thomas,5/5,1262822400,This Tea should get the Nobel Peace Prize,This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas. But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered. but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!
8020,B004SISLQ0,A19MMYMZO363KM,Lincoln County MT Focused on pinecones,1/2,1276214400,Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.,I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

Yes. the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones. hence why you want to thin it out. I read the other reviews and can't believe they never thought to mix this food with something else.

He likes it cold or warm. Yes. it's quite plain tasting to our grown-up palates but in my opinion great for the little ones. I started putting some cracked pepper and herbs on it more recently. Sometimes. I serve it as a snack. sometimes as a side dish to meatballs or chicken. Highly recommended.

These are perfect. because they're chewy. so they feel and taste different from her food. She does tricks for them and always comes running when we bring them out. Definitely try them. They are healthy (grain free) and perfect for any kitty! To the comment about the bag. just buy a treat jar. Works much better. and it looks cuter on your shelf or counter :)
8076,B0012KB4M0,A21JYO15M2PET8,"Karl A. Jeney writer, dreamer, idealist",6/12,1298678400,Purina Busy Bone - A Lethal Product for your Dog,I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning. February 25. 2011. I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta. our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina. a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker. Bayer. Gerber and General Mills. could have not only manufactured such a lethal product. but. as I've since discovered on the Internet. has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta. purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008. is dead because of your product.  And Lori. my sweetheart of 32 years. a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover. has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for Best in Show. including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder. and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups. and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week. sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer. his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled. uses a walker. is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad. he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston. like Greta was. is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us. he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing. by nature. requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta. all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone. not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone. several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So. I served her a smaller portion each time. which. after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment. while we were in another room. Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs. but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now. as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I. a writer. cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta. only 2 ½ years-old. healthy and in her prime. a wonderful. loving companion. is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately. and to conduct adequate. responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta. purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever.
8077,B0012KB4M0,A22PMSZFNJMQTD,LI Reviewer,0/2,1266105600,Great Buy BUT,Bought these for my two dogs. one and English Mastiff and the other a Black Mouth Cur [...].  I thought it might keep them occupied for at least an hour as other reviewers had stated. Well. of course. my dogs had to be different. 10 minutes flat. all chewed and gone. I might add. both of my dogs are aggressive chewers and that's the reason I went looking for something that would last. For other dogs. who chew normally. it may well last for an hour or so.<br /><br />They both love these bones and this packaging is a great buy. I will continue to buy and give as a weekend treat for my boys.
8089,B000NY6PPW,A1IL52911KWSHY,Susan Dowling-Dreyfus,1/4,1330300800,READ BEFORE BUYING,I had used this frequently on and off over the years and didn't realize that it is not sold in the US any longer.  In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing. all 10 packs expire in 6 months time. so don't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.  Rated 1 only because I am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date.

Mason,5/5,1264464000,Keeps the pups healthy,I recently invited a baby mini doxie into my family and had an existing 2 lb. chihuahua that the vet constantly told me to try and fatten up. I would try hamburger and cottage cheese and all the things he told me and she would either get a tummy ache or just not gain weight. I bought this food with the doxie in mind and fed it to the chihuahua too and she started to gain weight within the week. I now have to watch the portions i give her or she will over gain. Two healthy dogs with the help of this food. When the doxie gets older. I will continue to buy the Eukanuba adult brand.

When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.

8144,B002GWMA08,A1YF3GYWQL9HON,DHK,4/5,1322870400,Very Disappointed,What constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective. You can read countless reviews about it. but you don't know until you've tried it for yourself.  Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world . I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy. was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast. has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry. but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans. and brewed it in a press. Sad to say. it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  The flavor was stale. without any fruity characteristic of peaberries. and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner.  The worst part is I am stuck with 3 lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned (Amazon does not accept return of food items).
8149,B002GWMA08,A1LGZJ2R9KY7GV,William S. Owen,0/0,1340755200,Too dark,The coffee was not stale as some have had. but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this.  I believe a better product could be had with the same beans.
8152,B002GWMA08,AZ8H55VKA4MA3,"David, Winston-Salem, NC, USA",0/0,1327881600,Good price for a good coffee,I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain. which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee. Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and. thus. had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine. and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended. I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster. and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct. and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out.

8189,B000FFILBA,A20PXGVX8OVEOM,ISaidThat,2/2,1187913600,Tastes more like a green than an oolong,Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong. then it probably is an oolong. but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea. and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea. and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything. the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold. the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website. and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it.

She really loves them. however they don't love her back. It took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together. Finally after a google search. I came across these reviews. I stopped giving her the treats and so far. my cat has been vomit free. Buyer beware. this might not happen with every cat. so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly. Back to her greenies I go!!

8285,B003VXFK44,A1RVCWFP3SC3GU,Cakediva,1/1,1300233600,YUMMY,We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
8293,B003VXFK44,A3TQW5KBBPZHNC,K. E Pearce kpearce,1/1,1296518400,If you want a flavored coffee. okay... but otherwise YUK,Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.
8297,B003VXFK44,A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ,Thomas F. Harper Jr.,1/1,1294876800,Good coffee. but lets clear up the flavors?,I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee. but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut. vanilla. caramel. rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off. I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.  Some vanilla. but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact. after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.
8330,B003VXFK44,ALTEZ1X2X6M1N,S. WALKER,0/0,1349568000,Bitter taste,I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee. more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again. also way too expensive compared to the others.

8406,B003VXFK44,AAPFN1BADMWMC,Giancarlo Croce Offer VOID where prohibited,0/0,1332892800,Sorry Wolfgang!,I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM>Wolfgang Puck Coffee. Creme Caramel. 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting. the aroma is very nice. but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black'. the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste. but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild. and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang. but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.
8413,B003VXFK44,A7JCNKDASI7R0,J. Epps,0/0,1331424000,Pretty good coffee,This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good. but it has a good sweet flavor. and I can recommend it.
8429,B003VXFK44,AK7QWUSSUT6KS,John JSM,0/0,1328918400,Good Columbian,Dark and full flavored. but distinctly Columbian.  This is a great morning coffee. Better cup of AM Joe than you will get at a coffee place.
8442,B003VXFK44,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,Blythe Dresser,0/0,1327190400,An EXCELLENT hazelnut choice for your Keurig brewer...,I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI>Gloria Jean's Coffees.Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>. which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past. though. and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully. Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut. which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted. but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before. but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied. which is nice. but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast. but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out.
8452,B003VXFK44,A2T6J1XFG5O554,J. C. Brown CSP,0/0,1324771200,Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed,This is my daughter's favorite K-cup product. Mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having Wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen.
8460,B003VXFK44,AYOMAHLWRQHUG,Conspicuous Consumer $$,0/0,1322697600,One of the Best Mild K-cups Made,I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.
8462,B003VXFK44,A315FCBNG3XRND,William L McHugh,0/0,1322179200,Disappointed,Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste. not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices.
8486,B003VXFK44,A2SQ8N1KG3L7HU,Happy Grammy,0/0,1316563200,Jamica Me Crazy.....So Good!,I was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it.  I bought a sampler of k-cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that I liked to order in the future.<br /><br />After drinking Jamaica Me Crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing I liked it.  When ordering. reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy. leaving me wanting more.  I was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad I did.  Everyone I have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too.
8489,B003VXFK44,AB6G1LUA9TG2L,Lisa,0/0,1316131200,Yum-o,Best K cup around. A must try!  Amazon ships quickly and in one piece. I'd recommend the coffee as well as going through Amazon to order this coffee from.  Thank you for a great experience.
8497,B003VXFK44,A1AND5XBFJ7L76,Jamie Stell,7/7,1289260800,Wolfgand Puck Rodeo Drive K-cup,This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger.  We loved it and it has become our favorite.  If you want some coffee to caffeine you up. this is the one for you!!  Also. Wolfgang Puck's Breakfast in Bed is great...not so strong!
8499,B003VXFK44,A3VS66YC7IXCC2,J. Hytree 2nd Time Mom,6/6,1286323200,Not as good,This is very good coffee. but it doesn't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel.  If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor. go with the other.  If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor. this is it.
8504,B003VXFK44,A2WX8REGY23RQU,Elakshi brighteyes,0/0,1314230400,Yummy hazelnut,This coffee is surprisingly delicious. We never had a problem with the k-cups bursting; maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer..? This coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste. Look forward to my mug every morning. Would definitely recommend it and will buy it again.
8505,B003VXFK44,A29DK932WF1HWV,By His grace,0/0,1314230400,Coffee,I personally did not care for the coffee. too mild for me and a little nutty flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends. also Emeril's Big Easy bold.
8507,B003VXFK44,A1XOWOPD0JNLST,Rita G. Wood,0/0,1312848000,Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut,This is my 1 favorite coffee. Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Question:  why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon
8511,B003VXFK44,A2M3I5JEBZJR40,Ernie WardenKeeper,0/0,1311379200,Works for me.,This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold. full flavored taste. I would recommend.
8512,B003VXFK44,A2TH3R48TMDRNC,George Olijnyk,0/0,1311292800,You don't have to look any further,I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many bad coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor.  You don't have to try them all. this is a perfect blend coffee.
8552,B003VXFK44,A3DRMWICV8EU16,kh,0/0,1304208000,Jamica Me Crazy,This is my favorite coffee flavor and I have not had it in a long time.  Forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k-cups.  Love them. already ordered more.
8562,B003VXFK44,A3KSV9A3PE3M3M,PNG,0/0,1300406400,Not as sweet as other French Vanilla coffees,I admit. I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee brew. meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand. it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I don't have to order quite so often.
8567,B003VXFK44,A31LWRGL7B9Y7P,Linz,0/0,1298937600,great coffee,The coffee was great. Spent some time in Jamaica and got to love the coffee. Nice to get in back home as well.
8570,B003VXFK44,A26OE2P0ESL9PH,grjudy,0/0,1298592000,Rich and wonderful,Creme Caramel is by far my newest favorite!  Great coffee flavor. not too weak. with a wonderful caramel aroma!
8575,B003VXFK44,A3KWN5WDEUEJ9V,Brian K James,0/0,1297900800,One of my favorite K-cups,This is one of my favorite K-cups.  It's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some.  Highly recommended.
8642,B003VXFK44,A3GXD534HVVBYM,P. Preston,3/5,1298160000,Flavored cofffee?,I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.
8645,B003VXFK44,AJZ41FI5FK2CH,C. LaRue,1/2,1300665600,What a waste of money!,Unfortunately. I'm much too frugal to throw away something I've spent perfectly good money on. so I'm continuing to use these suckers until they're gone (hopefully in a few weeks). I thought I was buying a decent brand of coffee. given the Wolfgang Puck name. but alas. I was wrong. Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker. these k-cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like brown water. No taste. no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and it's marginally better. but still barely drinkable. I wouldn't serve these to guests EVER. I can't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please don't waste your money.
8658,B003VXFK44,A3P84TZX9X1B3X,KIMBUYS kimbuys,0/1,1339286400,No flavor - very weak,I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.
8662,B003VXFK44,A2BUR03REASIKQ,Nathan M. Scaparotti crankywanker,0/1,1320019200,Hazelnut?!?,Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...
8675,B003VXFK44,A2CR1R7VU63YPT,gbosco band mom,0/3,1284163200,Can't offer much guidance,I ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children.  Unfortunately. there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the Fall semester.  Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value. I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too!
8689,B003VXFK44,AWB6OLPRMCLDM,Lucky Dog Paula C,3/3,1285286400,pretty good for decaf,I am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups I have tried but this one is probably the best.I like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what I would expect although it says medium roast.
8698,B003VXFK44,AHTACNRCJ00CG,bluebird60,2/2,1331596800,What a great cup of coffee,Sometimes I feel when I reach for a decaffeinated K-cup that I'm going to settle for less flavor. However. I'm completely happy with this product. I don't feel I'm missing anything. Everyday I treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner. This product just fits  what I'm looking for.
8732,B003VXFK44,A39KT4ATF5Q9UB,Scott R. Shelhamer AeroScott,1/1,1333152000,Almost Bitter,I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees.
8746,B000LKZ84C,AAY43PCKCVONT,f.,3/3,1309046400,Good product. but by the case. date's a little old ...,Recently purchased a case of Mori-Nu from Amazon ... I'd had this tofu before and the product I got from Amazon is fine. Though. a word of caution - my case only has about 4 1/2 months to go on its best by date. The date on the box represents one year from manufacture. so this product had been sitting around a while. Not a huge problem but I'll be looking for silken-tofu recipes now (vegan ice cream!). to use this up. rather than just having silken tofu on hand for a while. as I'd hoped.
8750,B000LKZ84C,APGQCBO10LZTH,LZ,1/1,1337212800,Good product,I use this in place of mayo for many recipes when I need something creamy and quick.  This also works very nice for sweet dishes as there is very little taste to the tofu and it does absorb flavors well like a chocolate pie.
8752,B000LKZ84C,A293N34D1VDE3,MJL,2/3,1302480000,GOOD TOFU,Good firm texture. comparing to other silken firm. this is just the right consistency. Hassle-free. it is easy to come out from the container Tofu shape as is.  Easy to handle and manage rather than crash or smash it.
8765,B005CM84XQ,A3PMHFRGHWUHWT,Jason C. Carter,4/5,1316995200,Be cautious,Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton.
8776,B000MGSJ5A,A1ZIL7YH0VMW7C,April Ames april_loves_animals,1/3,1326931200,Excellent!,I haven't tried eating it. I bought it to make vegan DIY pore strips. It totally works! Hooray! I didn't have much luck when microwaving it. but if you boil it like it says on the bottle it firms up quite nicely. Bear in mind. you must add soy milk to make the pore strips. The agar simply doesn't have the ability on it's own.
8778,B000MGSJ5A,AFO4RO1C3OHI4,Pam Sweitzer,0/7,1168473600,AGAR,Very difficult to work with - tends to turn to solid rock even when following directions - taste is less than desirable
8781,B00434FTDM,AP1FWNGNWO8JM,anonymous,0/0,1303344000,A good soup on cold nights,This is my favorite Progresso soup. The broth has excellent flavor and it's not too salty. Yes the veggies could be a bit firmer. but the pieces are large and tasty. It has some heat already. but I  usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste. If I really want to indulge. I'll chop up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating - heaven!
8784,B002RYVK24,A2SBH3K2UEKC86,Pamela Arivett,1/1,1303862400,Duck Rillettes - not much flavor,I bought duck rillettes from Amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by chefshop.com. I was expecting a really good rillette. Full flavored rillette. What I got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs/spices. The texture was good however. Tasted more like a pork rillette. I would not recommend Rouge Perigord Duck Rillettes.
8811,B00060PTLO,AKXLOUG2VFVPN,Carole Brawner Grandma Carole,23/23,1126742400,Low-cost Latte,Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso Coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it's also the cheapest!  I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.
8828,B00060PTLO,A1GYEGLX3P2Y7P,Shala Kerrigan,0/0,1343520000,Great for baking!,I love the strong coffee flavor of this for baking. and have been using it for nearly 20 years in my chocolate chip cookies and other recipes.<br /><br />It's also tasty to drink. For a portable mix. I'll use instant dry milk. this coffee. a bit of unsweetened cocoa and a bit of sweetener. Then just add boiling water and stir well to make a drinkable instant latte. It's not bitter or burnt tasting like some instant coffees can be.<br /><br />While it doesn't taste as good as a pulled shot of espresso. it's one of the best instant coffees I've ever tried. It's ability to mix well into baked goods ensure it's spot in my pantry.
8829,B00060PTLO,A2ZXWKYIOTGB4I,W. Alao,0/0,1324080000,for those that drink fresh ground only,I used to work at that well known coffee shop so I've become a bit of a coffee snob and I never drink instant. but if you are looking for a really robust instant coffee that dissolves in cold or hot water and goes great with a little chocolate syrup and cream you'll enjoy Medaglia d'Oro. I bought it during a run to the store for a few dollars cheaper than I can find it online. and much cheaper than a 3/4 lb bag they sell in the groceries stores.
8839,B00060PTLO,A2K38E6J2GX62K,Jan Dierckx,0/0,1166572800,Take a moment for yourself.,This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. A teaspoon in a cup is sufficient. Take care you don't boil the water. otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.

I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed. It's really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. I ordered the 4-pack and would really like to send back the three that I haven't opened yet if I can do that...

We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as Delicious and Decadent  and they are being extremely modest.

These are one of the better deals I could find when considering cost/ounce.  My Lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too.  The treats are soft and moist. which is a plus for my dog.  They could easily be broken into smaller pieces. but I generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good.  I wouldn't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit.  It's not an overly offensive smell. but strong enough that you don't want to carry it around with you all day.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these for all dogs.

9028,B006N3IG4K,A2GT5MEDUP5YCF,Donna Bollenbach,2/3,1286409600,Good. but not my favorite,I like strong. but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough. but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband. who likes a medium roast coffee. is OK with this coffee. but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe.

I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now. and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time. I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup. I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette. and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain. Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste. but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.

I wish you would use real coffee descriptions(i.e.. hints of xxx. smooth finish) rather than fluff advertising like Bring the aromas of France home with you and Profitez des bons moments (enjoy the good moments)! - what does that really mean?

I put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no I don't like sweet in the AM. But its not sweet. I am quite surprised at the flavor and how I like it. Would I like it every morning..NO but it was a nice change. Made me feel I was waking up in a Jamacian cottage on the ocean hearing carribean music. well maybe not but it was close
9116,B006N3IG4K,AOLM0G25WI2T2,liss711,0/0,1332720000,Just okay,I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was. almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it.

Mild to Medium Blend.,Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet. coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend. but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee. afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee. it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan. it is a blend to try on for size.
9158,B006N3IG4K,A21CZIJ7LXR1A1,Olinda Steady Shopper,0/0,1325203200,Good. not Great,I expected more flavor from W. Puck. Though this coffee does taste good. it didn't have caramel flavor as expected. This is my opinion. Someone else may feel differently. The price is okay. I would not discount this product at all. It's a good product. Try it. you may like it.
9160,B006N3IG4K,AMAAPF2CJN5TK,pelk,0/0,1324857600,Delicious!!,I am not a huge coconut fan. so I wasn't excited about trying this. but with one sip it definitely won me over!  The flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation.  And it smells so good!!!

9200,B006N3IG4K,A1FFP0ORCC7YH9,PCDogMom,0/0,1316044800,Best Coffee,Wolfgang Puck definitely has the best coffee for the money.  I absolutely love the French Vanilla.  The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though.
9211,B006N3IG4K,A3RFU2E6SX9PHG,DRenee,8/9,1291420800,Mmm. mm. great coffee aroma!,While looking for a top rated vanilla K-cup. I stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time.  I took a chance and ordered a double pack from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. This is a rich tasting medium/light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house. There is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who don't care for super sweet coffee. I would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our Keurig Coffee Brewer<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6>Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a>. People who prefer extra bold coffees would need to use two of these K-cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee.<br />  That said. we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable pastime at our house. The most popular combo's so far are Jamaica me Crazy with <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395DVQS>Van Houtte French Vanilla K-Cups for Keurig Brewers. 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.

9228,B006N3IG4K,A137QZWAFT6MG2,EB,0/0,1310169600,I don't enjoy this coffee,Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.

It has a really bold taste even used with the large-cup button. I like other coffee selections too. but this one really stands out.<br /><br />I consider myself an early adapter and the Keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases. Although the coffee is somewhat expensive at $.40-.50 a cup. there is no waste. no pot cleanup. and. best of all. great coffee. I usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank.<br /><br />I notice that regular retailers such as Target and grocery stores are now carrying K-Cups. but buying online costs less and is more convenient. pjs

I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM. I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth. not bitter. Overall. I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.

It's not acidic. not bitter. just a great MILD cup of coffee. which is exactly what it purports to be! I wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own stupidity. Don't buy a MEDIUM roast coffee and complain because it's not bold! Also. as a general rule the ones with Breakfast in the name are milder. I don't care for bold. dark roast. slap you awake coffee so I wouldn't buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold.

For those that like their coffee mild. I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold. I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted. it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee regular and black but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack.
9426,B006N3IG4K,A1ZZMAVRCBL357,K. M. Alley Grandpa,2/2,1286409600,K-Cup Fan,Wolfgang's Rodeo Drive does make a good ole cup of coffee. It is on the same line as Donut Shop. Very good morning coffee to wake up with.

9458,B000UBDKII,A3F9KSS9J4R00F,A. Franklin,2/2,1220832000,Bland,These pods are rather bland. I purchased them because I thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. They do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. I would not purchase them again. nor do I recommend them.
9465,B000UBDKII,A1KRGY0Y3BHCPC,JE,0/0,1335052800,Awesome coffee!,Just read the reviews that said it had a chemical taste - I totally disagree. I think it tastes wonderful! I guess its all a matter of personal preference. I love it so much. I cant go back to the regular unflavored coffee. The only thing that's too bad is that it's artificially flavored. I care not because of the taste. but because artificial flavors are probably not too good for me. But I love the taste anyway! Senseo could easily use natural vanilla flavoring. it is probably more expensive. but they should do it anyway to give their customers a better product. Unfortunately too many companies today use non-natural ingredients in the quest for larger profits. which is a sad commentary. Senseo. you need to start using natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial for the health of your customers.<br /><br />But I still love the taste and cant drink any other coffee! The Senseo coffee in general is so wonderful. I've gone through two machines already. The frothiness of Senseo coffee is so delightful...its like cappacino froth only better. I use Silk Vanilla creamer too which gives it an even better taste (their product DOES have the natural vanilla flavor so maybe that is helping with the taste.) Then I always top off my coffee with cinnamon sprinkles which makes it even more wonderful!<br /><br />All in all. a great coffee and coffee system. just please start using natural flavor Senseo. for the health of your customers! You would probably have even more customers if you did. :)
9466,B000UBDKII,A30QTPDG22CE0F,Ann Alan,0/0,1325030400,Chemical aftertaste - thought it was the coffeemaker. but it was the coffee,Although it sounded delicious. I was very disappointed in this coffee. The coffee has a strange. chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup. not just once.  Even when it brews. it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact. because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new. I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian. not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the artificial flavors used?  Be forewarned!
9470,B000UBDKII,A1JFT3GKXRL3ZH,T. Sigg,0/0,1303430400,Senseo Vanilla Coffee Pods,Good taste. a little on the weak side especially since I mix it with half soy milk after it's brewed.  Delicious nonetheless.

I love the french vanilla coffee pods.  I use one pod and select the 2 cup option as I dont like strong coffee.  You will instantly fall in love with the foam that is on top of the coffee.  Use fat free/ carb free vanilla creamer and you have a mighty tasty cup of coffee!!!!

9496,B000UBDKII,A2TXH37B9XJISL,M the Pearl M the Pearl,1/2,1217203200,Perfect for the non coffee snob,I'm not a coffee snob. barely drinking a cup a week. but my significant other needs a strong mugful every morning.  The pods and the Senseo machine are perfect for this; barely takes 2-minutes to brew.  The 6-pack box comes out to about 30cents a cup even with the added latte packets (60cents when two are used for a strong mug serving).  Wonderful aroma and works well with the flavor packets.  I'm hoping the money saved by avoiding Starbucks every morning will go to my potato chip addiction....

Satori,1/1,1265587200,Coconut Water is amazing... this particular batch is not perfect,Coconut water and its many benefits are nothing short of phenomenal and I personally was so excited to have an opportunity to purchase in bulk.<br /><br />What isnt phenomenal is that every single box in my 2 shipments must have experienced some temperature changes. or. they were discounted because<br />of a faulty snap-closure.  At any rate. almost every single carton either came with the lid broken off (adhesive gave out) or it eventually breaks off.<br />Not such a big deal. unless I want to take a carton with me.
9588,B002PO09MS,A16HREV5UC8V57,P. Orr,7/7,1321833600,Fondarific Fondant,I bought this fondant to use with young teen girls who had no experience with fondant.  We used gel colors to make several different colors. and the gel colors worked beautifully with this fondant.  We didn't need the expensive cake decorator colors to get gorgeous results.  The other thing I liked was this fondant was not hard to work with.  If you can work with playdoh. then you can work with this fondant.  AND it tasted good. too!  I have tasted other fondants and it looks pretty. but you peel it off before you eat your cake.  With this fondant you will actually want to eat it as well as look at it.  This is a good choice for cooks who like their creations to look and taste good.

9613,B004JHIBV0,ANB2IL7WGHQQ4,BozemanEric,7/8,1324771200,No problems from same batch,I thought that I should post a review in response to bad cat.  We ordered off the same batch for the same holiday reasons and had no illl effects.  The coffee was great.  There was no tart aftertaste no matter how strong you brew it.  The only reason that I gave it only four stars is that I would personally of liked a litter darker roast.  I just wanted to say that we drank off the same lot as bad cat. in the same year. Christmas Eve and Christmas. with zero headaches or ill tidings.  It just might have been something else.

I found that it was a really good spice to use and it makes food taste as if you grilled it on a charcoal grill which is awesome. Give it a shot you might like it.
9655,B001LXYA5Q,A13GG2CONW46H4,Pete,9/9,1322784000,Unbelievable!,I saw an article on Yahoo and figured I would give it a try. This stuff was unbelievable. I ate healthy foods for the first try. Some carrots. spinach. a red pepper and an orange. It was probably the best meal I had ever tasted. It was like I was eating a fruit picked from Eden. On the downside I could see this becoming an addiction!

However. if you decide to have a party where you invite guests to partake of handfuls of raw cranberries. lemons juice. tabasco sauce. beer. mustard. and a variety of other items which are sour. the miracle berry can do nothing at all to augment the considerable effect this will have on their bowels.

9674,B001LXYA5Q,A1VNOV3K0GS14L,Nikki Guerlain,2/2,1296518400,Neat stuff,Chewed a few of these and ate cheese. hot sauce and a bunch of citrus. Pretty neat stuff. If it was less expensive I could see this benefiting those who'd like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits.
9705,B001LXYA5Q,AIITBX9TQHSH5,James,0/0,1335916800,Eh,They do make sour stuff sweet for a bit. but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor... great novelty item.
9714,B001LXYA5Q,A2ZVD0RKL9A9XC,John Canterbury,0/0,1271116800,Miracle Berry....,Just a tad expensive. but neater than heck!!  It really does what it says!  Awesome!!
9725,B001LXYA5Q,AHMBYY544LOGG,J. smith,0/1,1350345600,Not as effective as competitor,I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.<br /><br />This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.<br /><br />I would not suggest this version of the product. other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries.
9731,B001LXYA5Q,AEHDP7D3JO4D9,Mohammad M,0/1,1270512000,magical!,this is quite neat!  i could drink a glass of vinegar and it would taste just like syrup!  it is certainly worth trying.
9756,B000KFXEYE,A33XL3E3XH2VW4,Carl Wainwright carl wainwright,1/1,1298764800,Best Hot Chocolate ever,I purchased this for my girlfriend who loved this stuff over the Xmas period. Now she has a supply which should last several months.
9761,B000KFXEYE,AO8H4TVN5RZMU,mspriss678,1/1,1278460800,Love it! Hard to find this at the grocery store,I've tried them all and keep coming back to the Belgian chocolate.  A chocoholic's dream. I drink this every morning and this seem's to be the most economical way to buy it. 6 cans at a time.
9785,B000KFXEYE,AI13RM4X048SG,Sherry,0/0,1326326400,Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa,Purchased original can at Walmart. Of course. during the holidays - it wasn't always there. I got on Amazon.com and found a really good deal on it. My family & I LOVED it thru the holidays and will be taking a canister of it with us when we go camping and using it year round. Good good product & taste!
9790,B000KFXEYE,A2DQSVSRB0BI10,J. Bell,0/0,1264723200,A definite favorite,Delicious taste---just like a chocolate covered cherry.  I especially like it added to coffee. Will give as gifts this year!
9794,B000KFXEYE,A3NXNY3NOQW0O0,B. Rock,0/0,1259539200,Great taste,I am on my second can. I ordered the case of 6 and I keep it hidden from the grandkids.  I never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate.  I just heat a cup of water in the microwave for 80 seconds and add the chocolate.  It dissolves completely with stirring.
9799,B000KFXEYE,A1MAZD6BBYAMOR,E. Price,0/0,1236988800,My Favorite Cocoa!,I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line. but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's). but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it. and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus. Stephen's cocoa is labeled Gluten Free -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).
9800,B000KFXEYE,A3EO1GNSLFG332,Julie M. Wolfer Etincelle15,0/0,1233187200,French Vanilla Cocoa-- Wow!,This stuff has an absolutely incredible taste. Very smooth and you can mix it with water or milk. If you like vanilla and you haven't tasted this stuff you are missing out!<br /><br />Get it. it's worth it!
9827,B001EQ5CK2,APIIRLP1JR2VI,spunky_m0nkey,0/0,1295913600,Great coffee. great price!,This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant.
9830,B001EQ5CK2,A399LZW1FMRWU2,B. Wells,0/0,1265932800,Good Coffee!,This is my second batch of coffee from Jeremiah's Pick. This is good coffee but not as good as their Foglifter. However. it you like a mild yet tasteful coffee. you will like this. I prefer a bit stronger brew though hence my preference for the Foglifter.
9852,B000KJRF40,A2MU769UQOS7ZF,S. Luw aspiring audiophile,8/8,1197936000,MMmMM!,I bought a few boxes of these for gifts and opened one up because I couldn't resist.  They're so damn good I ate half the box already.  I'm buying a few more to hand out for christmas!
9876,B000KJRF40,A3MY9DMD5VXHZL,Dev,0/2,1324166400,very cool gift,I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas. They are a bit smaller then what i figured they would be from the box. I havent given them to him yet of course but i am sure we will have fun trying them. The box came two day earlier then what amazon said they would come which is nice :)
9908,B001CGTN1I,A19MQQ1YD1YV4E,Angela Vasquez,37/40,1258848000,Great. but eat fast!,These seeds are perfect for tossing into yogurt or smoothie.  But you must consume quickly.  The seeds draw moisture quickly causing them to swell.  You will be picking them from your teeth for days if you do not drink with a staw.  I have taken them straight from a spoon and washed them down with a glass of water before my light lunch and they really do give a feeling of fullness.  Do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of stimulus. I wanted to try something natural that would not raise my pulse. quicken my MVP heart and just not make me overall jittery.  These do the trick.  When I drink a meal replacement drink. I still feel hollow inside and want to snack.  By adding a full. rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes. I feel nice and full.  These can be tossed into a powdered drink. a canned ready to go drink (milkshake type) and even into a vitamin water.  But believe me when I say. you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon. they turn into a jello consistency quick....which actually is not bad either.  You can bulk up a 100 calorie pudding snack by stirring in a teaspoon or so.  Many ways to get creative with the Chia seeds.  Enjoy!
9914,B001CGTN1I,AXJGCAD36N915,Marilou Baughman,10/11,1254873600,good quality,I don't know if chia seeds are really a super food. but this brand seems to be very good quality. I've bought other kinds. and these LOOK better. And since I only eat them sprinkled on my morning cereal. it's not that expensive to buy this higher-priced brand.
9915,B001CGTN1I,AHF94XMY23UDC,Heather,6/6,1305849600,Good for your belly. good for your heart,Seeds are a staple in my household. I always have flax for baking. hemp seeds for snacking. and chia for added protein. iron. calcium. and omega-3s in my daily morning smoothies. I know you can add chia seeds to salads. but I don't personally prefer the taste. They don't really have any taste. so they aren't bad. just not something I would personally eat a spoonful of. Chia seeds are an important to my daily routine because they have a decent amount of iron and don't hurt my stomach. I'm very sensitive to iron supplements. and don't eat meat. Chia seeds is something my doctor recommended I try to add to my diet. and he and I are both glad I did. Navitas Naturals makes excellent products. and I have purchased many of their brand items. In my freezer right now is their raw maca powder. cacao nibs. flax seeds. mulberries. acai powder. wheatgrass. and goji berries. I am always impressed with the freshness and quality. I have not noticed any processing remnants in their products. and they always arrive fresh from Amazon. who seems to have a much better turnaround time than my local Whole Foods. And the price is unbeatable. My favorite smoothie is 1 cup of almond milk. 1 scoop of wheat grass or Amazing Grass. a huge spoon of whatever nut butter is in freshly made. 1 teaspoon chia seeds. 1 tablespoon hemp seeds or hemp protein powder. 1 tablespoon cacao nibs. two huge handfuls of spinach. a banana. and ice. This tides me over from 6 am until I eat lunch around 1. (The Chia contribute a lot. since they gel up when in contact with liquid. they leave you feeling fuller for longer) I'd prefer to give 4.5 stars for nutritional benefits and ease of incorporation. but like I said. the taste is lacking. It is not nutty. despite their claims. It's really a non-flavor and wish they didn't lead you to believe most people would want to just snack on these as they are.
9922,B001CGTN1I,A1XCCS7VLCBL9I,Pokin,3/3,1342483200,Healthy and versatile,There are so many miracle health products out there it's hard to know what's for real.  But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.<br /><br />***Health Benefits***<br />- extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon)<br />- complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that. meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g / 1 tbsp) = 2g protein -- higher than most other grains and seeds.  Other plant sources with complete protein = quinoa. soybean. buckwheat & hempseed<br />- good source of fibre & potassium & calcium<br />- 3x the iron than spinach<br />- low in cholesterol & sodium<br />- doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen-like effects<br /><br />***Uses & Taste***<br />Chia seeds taste pretty good!  Rather. there's no strong taste the way sesame does. so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry. or a thicker jelly-like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit.<br /><br />Ideas for use: In a salad. added to smoothies. in a breakfast granola or yogurt. in oatmeal. used as an egg replacement in baked goods. on sushi. to make iskiate (chia fresca) -- a Tarahumara energy drink. or just straight up have a spoonful.  I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great.<br /><br />One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth. so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :)<br /><br />***This brand***<br />I haven't bought any other brand of chia seeds. but this one works so why switch?  Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag.  Bag is resealable. price on Amazon was better than in stores = a good buy.<br /><br />Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment - lemon chia cupcakes!  Bye bye poppy seeds!
9934,B001CGTN1I,AYQFLZT3LYP9F,Colleen M. Kelley,1/1,1340755200,Great!,I'd never tried chia seeds before. but I'm trying to be more health-conscious. so I ordered this with the intent to put them in my overnight oatmeal. They're great! A little goes a long. long way. I had no problems with bloating. they taste like nothing. and they pack a nutritional wallop. I've since added them to quinoa and couscous. and have a bread recipe I'm planning to try. Great value. I'll buy them again.
9939,B001CGTN1I,A10B7W4I5PM0SR,LaurenNYC,3/4,1271030400,New everyday food,I love adding chia seeds to my oatmeal or yogurt.  It makes the food more filling and doesn't affect flavor.
9957,B001CGTN1I,A3KURTMF4YP4S2,NomadicShopper,0/0,1342483200,Met my expections. hard to find locally (CAREFUL: THEY STICK IN TEETH!),It was always hard for me to buy this product locally - perhaps because it's so popular! I find these little chia seeds a good way to sneak in some extra nutrition and add some fill to my smoothies (otherwise all fruit + water or OJ). I've snuck them into other things too - oatmeal. salad. soups. If you add it to something wet. just note that the tiny seeds (think poppy seeds) will swell and turn a bit gummy. This isn't a big deal. but it changed the taste of my absolute favorite soup... so I don't think I'll try it in that one again (lentil). I drink my smoothies quick. so I add these as the last step. and I don't think they have much time to swell. The seeds themselves are pretty tasteless to me. just little black dots. WARNING: THEY WILL STICK IN YOUR TEETH! Seriously. These are an at home item only - when I can brush my teeth or swish well after. Don't try them at work. or before a big meeting. etc. Overall. I don't think they have changed my world... but a good little supplement/boost. and Amazon had them easy to get. and a great price compared to my local market. I took off a star because of the tooth concerns... but otherwise I wasn't expecting magic. They met my expectations and came fresh and well packaged.
9985,B000P41A28,A2OOCPLJM7I4VA,Victoria Compton Hyakamooks,38/48,1222646400,Constipation + Sucrose = No. thanks!,You think you're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula.  Sadly. that's not the case here.  This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining. guaranteed.  Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices. water. etc) is just not a sensible approach.<br /><br />Also. the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money. and they use a LOT of it.  With the same sweetness as country time lemonade. Similac Organic's sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.  Check the NY Times article for more info on this.<br /><br />Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term. possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no. thanks!
9986,B000P41A28,AMZ97CCWOB453,Pregbaby,18/24,1249948800,Read this article first,2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first. August 11. 2009<br />By  Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviews<br />I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is. until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier. but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar. or sucrose. which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians. there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste. they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat. leading to rapid weight gain in the first year. which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.
9997,B000P41A28,A2TGDTJ8YCU6PD,geena77,0/0,1347494400,Love this formula!,I wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula.  I chose Similac because they are a very reputable company and I had a ton of it from the hospital.  We have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both.  He got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems.  I read some other reviews about sucrose...well. sucrose is just sugar and ALL formula has sugar in it.  Other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar.  As far as the hexane goes. I did my research. ALL formulas except one (Babys Only) use the hexane method.  Babys Only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic..uh. no thanks.  Also Similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product.  Overall my baby is healthy and smart so I am very happy with this formula.
10035,B001CGTN1S,A3G4B602EO1XYX,Peter Buck,2/10,1286150400,tough to take,Ugh. this stuff may be good for me but it's not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while. and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didn't notice any obvious effect and I've slacked off.
10046,B0007ZLRUU,ACC3V47CSZC43,Joy Schmitz toddnjoy,1/1,1231891200,The best we has yet,We heard about this coffee before leaving for Jamaica so we pick up some and have fell in love with it.  The best we have had yet smooth without that bitter after taste so many other coffee have.
10054,B0007ZLRUU,A331TXDQ3NFCHG,David J. Sussman Dark Sky,3/7,1249948800,P.U.,I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop?
10069,B003EML8PM,A1VH8NQ5ZD8Y2A,Mary H.,0/0,1349136000,so good,These are so much better than the pre-packaged ones.  Not too many calories.  I cook mine for 2 min and 20 seconds in a very small microwave.
10101,B003EML8PM,AQ793FLSEWQAR,David,0/0,1336262400,The chips are down,The microwave Pork Rinds are a new product to me. but they are awesome!! buying a carton of them<br /><br />was a good deal and they have far less fat and carbs than chips
10119,B003EML8PM,A7JK6KSJIQI6G,BEDMONDS,0/0,1327881600,PORK RINDS,I ordered the pork rinds as a Christmas gift for my father in law. (He is one who has everything. and if you buy him anything. he will put it up.)Then I ordered some for my husband. needless to say I took some to work with me. We all have fallen in love with them. During this time. I have contacted the grocery store and they have now put them in their store. for everyone to purchase and enjoy.
10123,B003EML8PM,ADQGF68CXJOTX,Maxine Max,0/0,1325116800,The Microwave Pork Rinds Are Surpisingly Fantastic,I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However. I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago). however. the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted. these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.<br /><br />I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.
10144,B003EML8PM,ARDBQB9AIUQWL,bdrochelle,0/0,1312416000,Delicious for Adkins Dieters!,I've been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really spicy. they're more like mild in my opinion. They are good. they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store. not bacon-y at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. It's pretty bad. I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of.
10150,B003EML8PM,A15529AXIOJC0,Kathy,0/0,1309132800,dissappointment,was really dissappointed in product... too salty and poor flavor....Convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds...
10176,B003EML8PM,A3QRW2SUL6KRTD,Sue Ann,0/0,1301184000,These were awesome,I have recently had gastric bypass surgery and these are a good source of protein that are quick and easy to make.
10179,B003EML8PM,A34NVQTFD4QYJ0,Steve,0/0,1300147200,good. not great,I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.
10183,B003EML8PM,A18TSFDZ2I4W7T,Cj,0/0,1299196800,Amazon's Lowrey' bacon curls,This is an excellent product for curbing the appetite without the abundance of carbs.  They are crisp. fresh and great tasting.  Since I started eating these pork rinds. I dropped some unnecessary pounds.
10190,B003EML8PM,A2HIPP3F1KWVGA,R. Thompson Tool Nut,0/0,1297382400,Fantastic Snack!,Wow! These are great! I had them for the Super Bowl Party and everyone just went nuts over this product. Great taste and just the right snacking size. One word of caution. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Even though every bag I cooked was absolutely perfect. it was evident if you get distracted. they will burn real quick. Remember. this product IS NOT POPCORN. So there is no sound to help let you know its done. Again. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! They are fabulous!
10217,B003EML8PM,A3VSYJQBREQSC9,Lora E. Odom,0/0,1284249600,love it,love it. i always try to tell my friends so they can buy them too

Broome,0/0,1271894400,Great if you love fresh. hot. hot and spicy porkrinds,These are absolutely wonderful and they are shipped every month to my home so I don't even have to buy them from the store. I also get them for less than half the price I would pay at the store. I love shopping online.
10245,B003EML8PM,AJ6F74N1KTRG1,Cheryl Homer Cherio,0/0,1264118400,The Best Low Carb Snack,This is the best low carb snack next to popcorn. they are both microwavable.  I like it best with a sprinkle of lemon juice.
10265,B003EML8PM,A12EZUL89ERV86,C. Boucher CLB,0/1,1298851200,Love these. but they don't love me,I bought these on another online site and the Amazon ones are almost $3 cheaper. I love these. In fact. I've grown quite addicted. Unfortunatley. they have tons of sodium and also contain MSG. which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively. If I were only trying to maintain. these wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />I won't buy them again. for these reasons.
10297,B003EML8PM,A2HULQXHNHQ98E,Earl R. Bucken,5/6,1250035200,OK Product But..,I have popped several of these bags in the past week. And every single one of them does not pop up as much as they used to. They used to pop up like a bag of popcorn does. These bags stay very flat in the microwave oven. And when you take the bag out you have to be very quick about opening it. Or it implodes and sticks together!<br /><br />I used to purchase these Microwave Pork Rinds direct from the company. And had never had a problem until now.<br /><br />So it's up to you to decide if you want to buy these or not. They are very tasty and very healthy for you too!
10299,B003EML8PM,A19Y40NOPK7N5V,Mac,7/9,1300752000,WARNING! CONTAINS MSG and MALTODEXTRIN,Being a gluten sensitive individual. I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.<br /><br />Because I didn't first do my homework. and read the labels before I began consuming these. I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities/allergies to avoid this product.
10303,B003EML8PM,A21DGZYD1XA48P,Tim Mullins,2/2,1230336000,Great Taste Small Price,A delicious product. can't seem to find it in the stores these days. I recommend to try if you like pork rinds.<br />Quick Delivery and great to have for guests.
10327,B003EML8PM,A1MLXVVVLBPF7L,pjasings,1/1,1226880000,Yummmmm!,Just got these and tried them over the weekend.  They were easy to cook and taste great.  My husband saw that I had them and tried them as well. so now I'm glad they come 15 to a box.  These will be a staple on our snack shelf.  There is a big differance between store bought and these.  These are sooo much fresher (and tastier).  They also fit very well into my high protein/low-carb diet.  It's wonderful to snack on something with a crunch to it!
10364,B000V6FTTU,A27Z66S1BECCYN,Beau Steward,1/1,1294444800,Tastes good. at least,For a microwavable chili. this stuff. and the firehouse variant. do taste good. However. I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label. as well as tried some tweaking. and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting. the chili plugs the holes. and as it boils and water vapor expands. it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me. but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy. I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.
10371,B000V6FTTU,A3EJTMLA6L4FV1,Charles A Dennis Jr,0/0,1231718400,Campbell Chunky Roadhouse Beef & Bean Chili,Taste is not bad and there is plenty of beans and beef.<br />Too much sodium. If you have high blood pressure. this product is a no. no.

WTF? It has done it to me three times in a row. then I tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem. I'm not sure this stuff is even safe!

Dey,1/1,1297468800,A bit expensive. but you do get what you pay for,The stargazer lillies in this bouquet have an amazing scent that fills a room. which the recepient told me was heavenly. They live quite long when cared for properly. but it's important to remember that these particular flowers ship in bud form -- on delivery day. they aren't like the picture on the page here. but will reach that point in 3 or 4 days' time. Take that into account and plan ahead.<br /><br />The reason to choose this one over the standard version is the extra stems of the stargazer lillies because. as I mentioned earlier. the scent they carry is fantastic (the more the merrier!).
10416,B005HI55CS,A122G5F9OFXXSA,RDLMV,0/0,1324339200,yummm,We enjoy our maple syrup with waffles and pancakes on Sundays.  This is a great product made in a small farm in Vermont.  The syrup is natural and tasty.  No complaints here!
10449,B000S83R2M,A356ALXAC5COJ2,anknight,0/0,1350691200,Good tea. very gingery,This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.
10458,B000S83R2M,A2RFDK0V0RR7HF,Lynn Solo,1/6,1306454400,The worst 'tea' I have ever tried.,I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
10466,B0001FQUFS,A5XC3V39AEW6B,Hilda Mills,0/0,1342051200,Excellent,It is now 110 degrees here. so I am leery of ordering the cheese.  But it is excellent. and I will be ordering it as soon as it hits the 80's.
10467,B000KJF2R2,A2NSHZDIFXWRFP,Art Collector,0/0,1191024000,OK,The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees I've tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good.

10564,B004FDW4HU,ASJ0MKRFZC47B,Mermaid,1/1,1308873600,Minty Chocolatey Pieces,If you like mint chocolate. or York Peppermint Patties for that matter. then there's no reason you won't like the taste of these.  They're just like eating M&Ms but with minty freshness added to them.  4 stars because I think these candies are overpriced for what they are.
10596,B0000YQ050,A3TIZ7A06JYIVF,Love to read,0/0,1119398400,The Best!,I absolutely love this delicious drink.  I usually have it iced and top it with whipped cream. so refreshing and such a treat.<br /><br />Its so easy to make and tastes like a choclatey mocha thick shake.  We all love it and recommend this highly.  Have also used their smoothie mix...also excellent!
10610,B002DHN956,A1D3PHPQL70CTC,Matty,0/0,1346198400,A Good. Healthy Bar that's Not Very Sweet,The bar tastes good. if you're looking for something that's not too sweet. And on that note. you should know that you can probably find a better tasting granola bar. but it probably won't be as healthy for you as this one is.<br /><br />It's a good bar that isn't too sweet. and if you can buy them for less than 75 cents per bar. then I'd say you made a good purchase.
10614,B002DHN956,ACOQH59REWR,"Tamara Kreuz Author, The Stray Cat Handbook",0/0,1262995200,Yummy. Addictive Bar...Can I Afford It?,I'm used to overly sweet granola bars. so when I first had these it seemed like they needed some sugar. But by the time I got through the first box. I adjusted to the lower sugar content and found myself thoroughly addicted. They have a lovely chewy texture with plenty of huge chunks of almond for added crunch. These are GOOD! I would love to buy them in bulk and have them shipped automatically. but I wouldn't pay more than the three dollars or so a box (of six) that Wal Mart or Target charges. So a box of 24 should really be about $12. Even at grocery store prices. we would be talking about $16...we'll see how they're priced when they come in!
10618,B0002IZCZS,A1C3OSUG2TT970,Tian Wang,3/4,1229990400,Like this soba,I wasn't a soba fan before. but when I tried this I became a fan! Just cook for 5 minutes and drain. served either cold or hot. good with just simplest soba soy sauce!
10619,B004GU3YXU,A2VT1EEO2GTAY2,New York Bargain Hunter,10/10,1337731200,There are still shells/husks in the bag,I bought these based on another review from the other product. the Nutiva hempseeds 3 pack stating that those hempseeds have crunchy husks in it and these do not.  I also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here.  I was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds. sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds.  When I opened the package I was severely disappointed.  It was white with black bits all over the place.  I'll upload a picture when I get the chance. it looked like dirt.  I gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth. it was absolutely repugnant.  Maybe I received a bad batch. who knows?  I am not here to put off other potential buyers. just telling my story on my purchase.  I'm going to try another product because I really want to add Hempseeds to my diet.
10622,B004GU3YXU,A2Q124J8QC23AJ,Family Editor,2/2,1342742400,I really like Nutiva's hemp seeds!,I read a lot of the [mixed] reviews here. and I ordered the product.  I actually tried a small bag at the local Co-op.  I absolutely love them.  They are very tasty and have a not-too sweet nutty flavor.  Yes. there are some color variations in the bag. but it doesn't change the texture or flavor.  I eat them in salads. smoothies. with oatmeal. made chocolate candy with them. and eat them straight out of the bag!  I have not found a negative thing about them.  You should try them. you might like them as much as I do!  And. they are organic which is important to me.
10627,B004GU3YXU,A3H7JIO72M8MB,Leslie Jan Kashiwada,0/0,1351209600,Pouch was ripped,I love this product and order it frequently.  Usually it arrives in a timely manner and in good condition.  When I opened this last shipment I found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box.  I carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a 1 rip in the middle of the front of the bag.  Most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so I transferred it to a container.  The other pouch was intact.  I hope this is a one-time occurrence. and I will be ordering this again when I need more.  More care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed.

10644,B001KVNDM0,A3PECZX773ME74,E. K. Moseley,11/11,1247356800,Almonds,Blue Diamond Almonds. Whole Natural. 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24); I buy these nuts every time Amazon has them. They are very good for you and much less expensive then the grocery store when you figure per bag price I pay $.89 here.  I have a heart condition and need all the good protein I can get. These are a good source for this. It is only natural fat and no added salt. I wish I could get them even at a bigger savings with the 15% savings by Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />My husband carries these in his pocket as a mid-day snack and I have my daily dose that my MD orders. They taste very good once you get used to eating no salt or added oils.<br /><br />I highly recommend. I hope this helps.
10649,B001KVNDM0,A3MZ35DYJC9MBE,rk,1/1,1323993600,Good product but wrong description,we bought this based on what Amazon mentioned in its product description which says 100 calorie pack but this is not 100 cal pack they are infact 250 calorie pack.Nothing wrong with the item as such and not that I'm going to return it but I would prefer a 100 cal pack over a 250 cal pack. Amazon please correct the prod description.
10650,B001KVNDM0,A3C56IXBT4ETXA,Bashert,0/0,1344988800,Raw unsalted Almonds!,For those who remember cracking almond shells. this tastes the same.  Love that there is no salt added and perfect protein. natural snack  between meals or as a meal for people like me who always forget to eat. I've got them strategically placed to make sure something gets in during the day when I'm studying or writing.  If you prefer Blue Diamond dry roasted excessively salted almonds you probably won't like these.  I like both. just don't use salt except in baking.

Although this gives you less fat. there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB...

So we buy it by the case and everyone stays happy. It's a better price than our local grocery.<br /><br />This is a great. easy hot cereal with plenty of fiber and other good stuff. Despite all the added seeds. the flavor is still basic enough to support add-ins like dried fruit. brown sugar. honey. etc. It's also good plain and will keep you satisfied all morning. I also like this brand's cold cereals.

10857,B0034KP00S,A8QZJUJN7RH1G,Hipknitizer,0/0,1335744000,Best Almonds Hands Down,After trying every kind of almond out there over the years. I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh. salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day. usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately. this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores. so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.
10859,B0034KP00S,A18Z7ICRLVHBBP,Catherine S.,0/0,1332547200,Yummy in my Tummy :),I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago. as I often find myself jonesing for junk food. and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around. I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition. and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more. but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters. as I don't like producing so much waste. but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk. and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream. chocolate chips. and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you. but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E. 15% Phosphorus. 20% Magnesium. 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood. but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br /><br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function. keeps heart rhythm steady. supports a healthy immune system. and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels. promotes normal blood pressure. and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension. cardiovascular disease. and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men. 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea. then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br /><br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br /><br />So. in summary. Almonds are a very healthy snack. so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br /><br />1st be cautious about bowel tolerance or happy bowels if you prefer.<br /><br />2nd Taste.

10866,B0034KP00S,A1MV52KBC9HK75,Fairjoy,0/0,1318809600,Ideal Healthy Snack,The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry. the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore. it is not salty enough. On the whole. it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount.
10867,B0034KP00S,A2CNEFGEV07ZQ0,Eric Balkan,0/0,1314921600,Butter Toffee almonds are sooo good. but hi-carb,I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond. but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that. right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.
10881,B0034KP00S,ABK0KJL19GKJ0,sunshine,1/2,1343347200,Too much sugar - big time headache!,These gave me a headache. too much sugar. and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier.

10891,B004FRT992,A260ZWB4YBMBW7,M. Munch,3/3,1297728000,Best so far,So far this is the best cola flavoring I've found for those wanting to make their own cola.  It's got stevia in it. so it still doesn't taste 100% like coca cola. but it is SO MUCH BETTER than the nasty cola flavor that sodastream makes.  And hey - no artificial sweeteners is always good!<br /><br />It doesn't taste quite like cola. but it's close enough to make me happy and I liek it for it's own flavor.
10896,B00270Z6FA,AELT5A68YMWKY,michael bovelsky,1/3,1341792000,Stay Away from this company,This is a rip off.  Found out that you can buy this product for under $2.00 just about anywhere. not the $7.99 they charge.  In fact you can go directly to the manufacture and order.  Do not get rip-off.
10898,B000EM6PC6,A16IJXWUYQ6ZJC,Cathy A,8/8,1251849600,Works great with a Keurig Brewer !!!,I really love my Keurig brewer but after my third purchase of highly priced tea and coffee K-cups I knew I needed a more cost efficient solution. I purchased a My K-cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect. My tea consumption has increased to the point that I now use the Amazon auto ship to receive 6 boxes at a time so that I never run out. If you have a Keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution...you won't be disappointed.

Be VERY careful with this stuff. Just one drop causes myself and all the other insane hot sauce fanatics I know to beg for mercy.  It will cause avid tough guy hot sauce lovers to go into retirement.

IT'S HOT!
10968,B001BIXK7K,A3MRP5DY911AS3,Daniel W,1/1,1290297600,Practical for hotheads,this review ended up a little long. for those who want something quick. if you have any taste buds remaining this will easily provide a satisfying burn. at least when directly applied to your own food. but also works very well when used as an additive.<br /><br />the flavor starts a little smoky sweet and after 5 seconds it begins to creep in with the heat.<br /><br />that covers my quick verdict. and how it satisfies the reasons I got it. now here is what was going to be my original review and some personal accounts.<br /><br />I had read about various hot sauces for several weeks to find something I could be sure would satisfy. while well beyond the realm of a sauce. with a rating of 1.5 million scovilles. about 6 times hotter than an habanero and nearly twice that of the bhut jolokia. is as others have said hot enough to give anything a satisfying burn with a few drops.<br /><br />my applications so far include on a ritz bits sandwich. on a brownie. tacos. hot chocolate and my sleeping brother.<br /><br />for those of you that have thoughts of pranking others with something like this. I would at least recommend great care in choosing victims. woke my brother within 5 seconds and had him chugging milk withing 10.<br /><br />my personal favorite application is one drop on the ritz bits. I nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup. but. by no means recommended. I'm abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that I have no taste buds.<br /><br />lastly. so far as I can figure one drop of this in 8 fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about 300 scovilles. so I assumed 4 drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno. well. I could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it's way out alien style.<br /><br />and I just reminded myself that I got some sauce on my finger nearly 5 hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it.<br /><br />sorry if that's a little long. but I wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product.<br /><br />and very lastly. if indeed the dropper releases 50 microliters at a time (the best description of the measurement of a drop I could find) then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle. though I'm not that great at math. so you don't have to take my word for the numbers I give here.<br /><br />happy eating.<br />  Daniel
11001,B001NJI7GQ,A3HYF6WCIP4XXR,elena j,1/1,1278460800,Hydrating. Refreshing. Great-Tasting Drink,I discovered Vita Coco a few months ago.  Of the flavors I have tried. I like the Pineapple best.  It tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol.  I love the idea of an all-natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium.  Whenever I am hot. thirsty or a little run-down. I find that Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple really quenches my thirst. refreshes me. and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in Gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes.  An 8-1/2-ounce serving  has only 60 calories and 30 mg of Sodium (less than fat-free milk). with 515 mg of Potassium and 180% of the RDA of Vitamin C.  It's a little pricey. but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping. it's a great value.  Although I have previously purchased it on Amazon. I more recently bought it at GNC during Gold Card Week when there was a free shipping offer and a buy 2. get 1 free offer.  With a deal like that. it breaks down to less than 65 cents per 8-1/2-oz serving.
11004,B001NJI7GQ,A3U5ZDYHUHGVUR,Andre There you go~,1/1,1269302400,Awesome tasting!,Heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it. Had one while traveling and loved it!!! I sat on the plane enjoying it...I was thinking. I should bought another one!
11009,B001NJI7GQ,A3GWT4ZI2O43SH,kcarrolldesign,0/0,1349049600,Vita Coco with Pineapple - the BEST yet!,Of all the flavors Vita Coco produces. the Pineapple combination is by far the best - it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering.
11018,B001NJI7GQ,A8A616OW1Q9M5,Vito Wagner,0/0,1334793600,Best coconut water flavor and size,I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink. it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.<br />The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes. because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.<br />As with all coconut waters. the taste can vary slightly. but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant.
11086,B002TSHYSW,A1XRXZI5KOMVDD,KAF1958 amandaf0626,0/0,1307664000,Crispy and tart,Deep River Salt & Vinegar chips are thick and crunchy.  Very tart.  So tart that I can't eat them alone. They are perfect with a sandwich though. These chips are well coated with the seasonings. maybe too much seasonings for some folks tastes.  I suggest buying a small bag before purchasing a large quantity of these.  They aren't for everyone.  Enjoy!
11103,B002TSHYSW,A19NP8YYADOOSF,N. Krumpe,1/2,1287014400,Delicious. great texture. 3 ingredients,I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips. hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips. and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag. about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste. and I love the texture. and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes. Sunflower or Corn oil. and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so. here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories. 6g fat. 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again.

11119,B000IKEE9K,A3UNADAYDBWO4H,Wedding Gal,0/0,1257638400,Satisfied.,I saw the price on Amazon. and I jumped at it!  It was a great deal compared to others that I found on the Internet.  Bought the box of Jelly Belly Tangerine Jelly Beans as wedding favors.  Great Steal!
11135,B00213ERI0,A3FW6TWGY1DC15,Rachel Girltron/Rabbithorn,5/6,1249516800,Just delicious!,I love Dr. Lucy's cookies.  All the flavors are terrific.  I don't eat them because they're gluten free-I have no allergies-but I am a vegetarian who usually eats vegan.  I often crumble these (or the sugar cookie flavor) on top of a bowl of coconut milk ice cream-it's spectacular.
11140,B00213ERI0,A2F28R9U74PSG,The Inveterate Scofflaw J,2/2,1249171200,Good grief. these cookies are delicious!!!!,Are these really gluten free. because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as gluten free or diet but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly. even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie. I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt. no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds. no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist. sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously. Lucy. you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better. knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business. rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.
11167,B00213ERI0,A9UUOHLCLNJT8,Jenn,0/0,1290211200,Chocolate Chip Cookies,I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk. and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings. and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first. I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However. after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies. I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!
11170,B00213ERI0,A3EAHP98G856TQ,FAS,0/0,1287619200,They're amazing!!!!!!!,These cookies have no milk. no egss. no nuts. no gluten and no cholesterol or trans fat. which common sense says should make them taste like cardboard. if not even worse. I don't know how they did it. but these chocolate chip cookies are delicious. They actual taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste. If you've got allergies. try these cookies. You'll love them.
11172,B00213ERI0,A2HQXP26466PXV,mmmom,0/0,1284681600,lucy's gluten-free chocolate chip cookies,My daughter loves these!  We both have gluten sensitivities so we were so happy to find these!
11174,B00213ERI0,AFD7UDF7HOOLW,Amazing Grace,0/0,1278028800,Very tasty cinnamon thins,These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free. I just like anything that TASTES GOOD. whether it's low-fat. fattening. gluten-free. low carb. etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten-free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you dunk quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.
11180,B00213ERI0,ABFMLM8RX10NO,S. Johnson,0/0,1268784000,WOW!,After being diagnosed as a celiac recently. finding products that are tasty and gluten-free really challenged me.  I traded off tasty for decent tasting after a while. but FINALLY I have found something that actually tastes good.  The crunchy texture makes me feel satisfied after finishing the bag.  These cookies are truly delicious and well worth the journey to find them.  Since God hasn't healed me yet. I am so thankful that He let me find these!
11197,B00213ERI0,A3DAGJ9KKDOTLT,Zeva Soroker zeva_s,0/0,1250380800,delicious gluten free,for those of us who can't digest gluten. finally there is a cookie that tastes delicious and is easy on the stomach!!!
11205,B00213ERI0,A24X6593QVUZ4E,K. willette,1/2,1239753600,Run...Don't Walk to Purchase Lucy's Cookies,As a relative of a child with severe food allergies. i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit.  Until i heard of (then tasted) these gems! Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies. they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD. tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy. i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware. you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)
11207,B00213ERI0,A3B1ZPY5AF61T1,Cindy V. Ramer Desire to learn,0/1,1245283200,Awesome Cookies,I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome. The serving size is 4 cookies. calorie count per serving is between 100 and 120 and fat is between 1 and 2. Great flavor and crunch and almost healthy.
11216,B001KVPC0G,A12J78776LOMEL,V. Martin V.,4/4,1207267200,A 'Flavorite' Treat,Very tasty and great for a late night snack. a sitting at your desk snack. and/or a traveling treat . If you're not a big fan of salty treats. steer clear.

Nicely sized can and a good deal here on Amazon. Lasts me a while between purchases and saves me money too. What can I say. they're delicious.
11249,B0007ZKS00,A54Q23KJDSWWR,BluJeanBabyWYLady Blu Lu,1/1,1336521600,Conscientious Seller,I was not satisfied AT FIRST with this product.  After posting a less than glowing review. I was immediately contacted by the seller (distributor).  They graciously sent a new fresher bag of coffee.  This is much closer to what I remember.  Try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested. it is served that way in Jamaica.  Now if I only had some coco bread to go with it.<br /><br />Thank you for the prompt. courteous service.

11275,B000E21Z7Q,AT6BKQY22TA45,Stephen D. Cole,1/1,1256256000,blech,These aren't clearly labeled GLUTEN FREE. They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. They are a weird flavor. sort of costly and not worth it. eew.
11315,B0041QD39O,A9QT2VJ48SJG4,Jason D. Enochs army_tacsat,1/1,1330560000,Black Gold,I have been drinking this coffee since I learned that it won a national (televised) competition for best tasting coffee in its category (organic).  I can't drink any other coffee now because all the others taste terrible compared to Weavers. Try this...grab a handful of whatever whole been coffee you drink in one hand.  Hold a handful of Weaver's whole been coffee in the other.  Look at the size of the beans.  Now notice the texture and smell of the  beans.  You don't even have to taste them to see that it is a high quality product.<br /><br />I used to order this coffee directly from Weaver's website until I found it here on Amazon.  I was worried that it would not be as fresh as the coffee ordered directly from Weavers but Amazon sells so much of it. that it never sits around for long before being shipped out. It also arrives much faster via Amazon.<br /><br />I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  It is a little more expensive than standard coffee but not much.  After you taste it. you won't mind the price.<br /><br />God bless Amazon. UPS. and Weavers.
11326,B0041QD39O,A13Q6WWE21ROBX,R. Weilep,2/3,1323388800,Fairly Good,I found this coffee to be fairly good but by no means outstanding. I did not detect any caramel finish. In my opinion it cost far more than its worth.
11327,B0041QD39O,A2VCARWRI54GZS,Dkav,2/3,1309219200,The Best,I am a coffee fanatic and drink it for the taste. all natural from a french press. I have tried many different kinds here on Amazon and can say that Weavers full bodied is truly the best with flavor that is not too bitter and not sour. you do have to know how to make it right...
11329,B0041QD39O,A2ZIDP9HW05GRS,emilyrr,2/3,1285113600,amazing coffee,Tried this coffee while working an early morning job. It was one of the best coffees I have ever tried. The flavor is warm and strong. and I left me wanting more than just one cup. I go to Starbucks all the time. and I honestly thought this coffee was better :) definitely recommend!
11331,B0041QD39O,A2NCCN1AKS0UJX,Andrew J. Peterson ap30,0/0,1349827200,I've had better,camerons organic velvet moon is way better. Comparing the two products this product isn't what it is hyped up to be.
11342,B0041QD39O,A3DCRV05ZIEWGV,"D. Flores ZenMaverick, Inc.",2/4,1299110400,IT'S GOOD STUFF. BUT DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,Hmmm. where to start.  It's a really. really good cup of coffee.  It definitely deserves 5 stars. no doubt. happy to drink it. would be proud to serve it to my guests.  Perhaps best called caramel finish. not sweet caramel finish - might need a little turbinado sugar to get the sweet part.<br /><br />I do not think it is better than the Cafe Altura Dark Roast Columbian sold by Amazon in 32oz bags.  I would consider them equals. but the Weaver's is not better. and you get more coffe for less money with the Cafe Altura.<br /><br />I'm sure being called the Best Organic Coffee on the NBC TODAY Show was a good shot in the arm for sales. but I sincerely doubt that they are the new standard in artisan coffee.  I think of coffee like Italian restaurants in New York/ New Jersey.  The great ones have endured. and everybody knows where to go for great Italian food.  But. when everybody is making the same stuff really well. what you're left with is your personal preference.  Weaver's is lucky to have some devoted coffee drinkers. but they're not a new standard by any stretch of the imagination. way too many people growing & roasting great coffee for that.
11354,B000N62EKK,AXX2ETG3LM1ML,Lynn A. Peaslee Winnie,0/0,1338768000,Lamb Treats - the only treats for my dogs,I have been giving these to my dogs for the past couple of years.  They love them.  Even though it is a bit pricey. the bag lasts a long time.  We have 3 dogs (spoiled dogs). They get these treats as rewards for good behavior or really for just anything.  This bag lasts a couple of weeks.  Merrick is an excellent company.  The dogs love them and really. what else matters?  This was an excellent price! Will be ready to buy more soon.
11360,B001QPK116,A3N5ATYP7UKEYR,VA,0/1,1311552000,Mmm mmm good!,A friend of mine recommended these chocolate nibs and I love them. They arrived promptly and undamaged. And most importantly. the price was great!<br />:)
11387,B0002NVKWW,A2GFF34UP8WJ3N,Avery St. Clair,10/10,1198713600,Knock your socks off,Even if you think you know Italian dry mushrooms -- order these and find out how wrong you were.  Unbelievably beautiful. deeply fragrant. terrific huge intact slices.  Flip all the cards over: these completely redefine the category.  Not just for sauces: soak a few to garnish your steak.  Make a knockout appetizer with these porcini. some stock and a shot of marsala.  To top it all: the price is reasonable.  Bravo!
11422,B0002NVKWC,A253B44S7G7LGZ,Richard P. Radis Isotria,1/1,1297382400,Boletus edulis,Excellent rich flavor and the mushrooms were freshly dried.  Based on the spores under a microscope. were these 100 percent Boletus edulis?<br />Rick
11424,B0002NVKWC,A1VDR5M6GJ1A2K,rc13 rc13,0/3,1272844800,okay. tasted better.,These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.
11452,B005C3IVN8,A1QO4TBQIFTQBI,Alan Smith,2/2,1330560000,Good flavour. very nice,I've heard that some grade B Maple syrups are too strong.  Maybe so. but this stuff is excellent.  This is the second quart we've received. and the flavour is perfect.  A bit stronger than grade A. but sweet. and very pleasant to my taste.<br /><br />PERSONAL TASTE NOTE: I also like my honey straight from the hive. and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger. as well. as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in.  That being said. I have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup. as well.
11453,B005C3IVN8,A2NK4A664Q1U7C,C. Scrafford Owl of Snows Moon,1/1,1349568000,This is a good syrup but...,It is not Vermont Maple Syrup.  I am originally from upstate NY and grew up with<br />the Vermont Maple Syrup and I am used to it. This syrup lacks that little tang(for lack of a better word) that the Vermont Syrup has.  It does come in second tho.
11455,B005C3IVN8,A3HECKQ9P79EY9,Wayne,0/0,1351123200,Andersons grade B Pure Maple Syrup,Being a hard core all things from Vermont are the best kind of guy.I was a bit apprehensive about buying maple syrup from Wisconsin.But the low price and a visit to their fantastic user friendly website sold me and boy was I glad.I purchased Andersons Grade B.(my favorite grade).through Amazon annd found it to be by far the best tasting grade B I have ever tasted.Uniqley hardy yet not too molasses like.this syrup hits all the right notes.I will continue to buy this syrup to satisy my grade B obession and highly reccomend it to all.
11464,B005C3IVN8,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,Brad Willis,0/0,1334361600,Yum!,Every bit as good as the Vermont maple syrups. in my opinion.  As you may know. Grade B maple syrup has a stronger flavor than Grade A and I prefer the grade B version.<br /><br />Looks like Amazon's out of stock as of this writing.  Hopefully they will get more soon because it's quite good and also was well-priced.
11486,B004LKZVX6,A2L99MZJFLPLGR,A. Yates Abby,2/2,1315267200,delicious and refreshing and GREEN!,This is a great way to trick children into drinking juice. it is organic. flavorful and the berries give the tea a red/pink/purple color.  No more food coloring. artificial flavors or sweeteners.  Everything I could have asked for.  Even the packaging is Green. it is printed with soy ink.  This is a company you should be proud to support.  The only way it could be better is if it was made in my home town. so it would take less energy to get it into my tummy.  It is absolutely refreshing and nourishing.
11495,B001EQ5D6U,A2J6CSTJJIP0JD,All Boys,1/1,1211587200,The BEST fiber cereal I've ever eaten!,LOVE. LOVE. LOVE this cereal!  It tastes like a caramel version of cinnamon toast crunch.  All Fiber One products are great!  Not like other fiber products that taste like cardboard!  Get your daily fiber with a product that is actually delicious.  Highly recommend.
11496,B001EQ5D6U,A3NF5J6DYJ5SRL,The Lady,1/1,1210982400,My 3 year old loves it!,I decided to give this a try because their fiber bars were so good.  Well. I was not disappointed.  I've been eating this regularly since I bought it.  Everyone including my 3 year old loves it.  The best part. we are meeting our daily requirement for fiber.  I know because we're pretty regular now.  It's great to eat something that's good for you. and good too.
11508,B001EQ5D6U,A3N94EX7EQNWWN,M. Carr,0/0,1207958400,Pure health!,The best in fiber. as crunchy flakes.  Great as is or topped with fruit plus added skim milk or yogurt and you have a fresh start to your day!
11519,B0002UM1AA,A3072VKAJZ18X0,Meglet,1/2,1337817600,Exquisite! An elegant addition to the breakfast table or tea tray,I am in love with everything rose. I wear rose lotion ( <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087L6T>Rose Milk Skin Care Lotion - 8 fl oz</a>). I burn rose candles (<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00069ZDJS>Yankee Candle Large 22-Ounce Jar Candle. Fresh Cut Roses</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEWDH6>Votivo Aromatic Candle Rush Of Rose</a>). I use rose lip balm (<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049XKXRY>Rose Love Balm (Limited Edition) - 15ml/0.5oz</a>) and I drink rose tea (<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTRI>Teas' Tea Rose Green Unsweetened Tea. 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>.) I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this. *rose preserves*. literally preserves made with real rose petals. I couldn't wait to try it. Oh. the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster. I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent. eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles. toast. ice cream. fresh fruit & yogurt. and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet. that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness. even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet. there *is* a definite rose flavor in this. and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently. according to another reviewer who has tried other brands. Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So. while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes. occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I>American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>. Joelle's <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4>American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>. and Lisey's <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO>American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch. because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact. I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed. I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover. or looking for a unique gift. perhaps a cute and clever new spin on a bouquet of roses and a box of candy. I highly recommend these rose preserves!
11521,B0013M342K,A26QTYMS8DOY0N,Molly,2/2,1295740800,Best mustard ever,This mustard was given to me by a client. This is truly the best Dijon mustard I have ever had!  I highly recommend it. I put it on literally everything. The other night my husband and I slathered it onto steaks. Delicious!
11524,B005HB4HGU,A11VH8PJ2MEHFV,Potato,16/17,1314662400,Great salt,This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt. but I want to say that this has a rounded flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food. rather it seems to become part of the food. going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly. but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.
11525,B005HB4HGU,A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1,citizen fact checker,16/18,1316649600,For more than salting foods.,Yes. I do use this product for salting some of my foods. but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal. I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet. and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.
11528,B005HB4HGU,AC9JAT85740ME,chingchong,13/16,1297036800,super fast shipping. free samples,placed the order on tuesday. received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition. it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt. lemon citron flake salt. and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry. doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes. i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet. but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).
11536,B005HB4HGU,AFSMZZ0GTEVKL,James,2/2,1339113600,Wonderful product,I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock. but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more.
11542,B005HB4HGU,A33X9WBR7YD39H,Jeff,2/2,1330473600,Perfect!,I use this salt very liberally now especially after finding out that its table salt you really need to avoid.  Our bodies need salt to live and this is the purest kind out there.  I plan to make this salt a part of my regular diet.
11546,B005HB4HGU,A31DCD0A4IPPV0,Joshua Wagner,2/2,1318636800,Great coarse salt,Great buy!  Fantastic taste and pleasing pink hue from the iron content.  I prefer a grinding salt. and this one is unprocessed for it's better for you.
11550,B005HB4HGU,A1R9CPBBJNM8XN,birdman213,1/1,1335398400,Great Salt - difficult to grind,This salt is great and way cheaper than any of the local spice shops. It does seem more difficult to grind than other himilayan salts I have tried. but doing a little at a time makes it well worth it. Would i buy it again?? YES
11563,B001EQ59GE,ADKDYRNQBRTJ9,Roger Lilly,0/0,1308096000,Paprika supplier,I ordered this product as my previous paprika supply was nearing exhaustion.  My previous supply was the same brand and also in the 18 ounce package.  For some reason these large containers are no longer available in my local grocery stores so I turned to the internet for help.  To date I have not used any of this paprika but well when my current supply of homemade BBQ sauce is exhausted.<br /><br />I had not previously purchased from this supplier however the shipment delivery was prompt and it was well packaged.  I am very satisfied with the supplier and would not hesitate to purchase from them again.
11573,B0051IWQ26,A2VFQO4G3DKWT2,Erin,1/1,1340064000,Erin T,mix 1 vanilla is really great and versatile stuff.  For starters. I love that the protein source is whey and not soy.  They also use real ingredients and are locally made in Boulder. CO.  mix 1 is great as a meal replacement. meal supplement. snack. recovery drink.  Since they don't require refridgeration. I keep on in my ski bag as a apres-ski drink (I get hungry on the drive back into town and mix 1 works great).  I also do triathlons and find that mix 1 is great as a pre-race meal and doesn't upset my stomach later on while I'm racing.  Finally. mix 1 is a perfect recovery drink after a long workout.
11578,B002DD3NM4,ASVK8EB8CML4X,Lindsay Nixon happyherbivore,4/8,1274054400,WAY TOO SPICY,It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy. threw it out and made my own.
11589,B002Q7ZYA6,A1HZYK8QIB84HU,S. Boyd,6/6,1260144000,Don't buy from this company,I get around a shipment a week all year round from Amazon. and I can not remember ever writing a review. But I am making a point of expressing my anger over this product. I buy lots of tea from many sources and white peony is one of my favorites. The package says it is organic and of the finest quality. It was possibly the worst tea I have ever tasted. In fact. after a couple of pots. I actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash. And the price wasn't even that good. I subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from Whole Foods for less. Whatever they are. this is not a tea company.

Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this. so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today!
11605,B0026WL14E,A117WANTSF2DIJ,Jessica Lee Jessica,1/1,1256774400,The BEST there is,This cocktail pep is absolutely the best there is. I live somewhere that it is not sold in stores. so I am constantly buying different types of pepperoni to substitute for Oberto's Cocktail Pepperoni and none of the many that I have tried have even come close.
11606,B0026WL14E,AFE88MWKWJQ3F,Rosie B. Taylor,1/1,1231804800,VERY GOOD,My son is in MCC in Washington State. he received these items. and so far. no complains.

But I would definitely purchase this again.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026WL13U>Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks. 3.8-Pound Package</a>
11639,B0032RPLSY,A3IU2PQXCUZPTA,FearFox,21/21,1276560000,Good stuff,I don't know if I have a lot of credibility to review this. since this is the first time I tried ghee. I loved the booklet that comes with the purchase and assures that this is 100% grass-fed ghee. which was my main consideration. It's great for cooking. since it doesn't smoke or burn even on high temperatures.
11642,B0032RPLSY,A2X3S36MXGQQQ6,Foodie fan &34;Annie&34;,7/7,1270425600,Sweetest I tried,I have made my own ghee and purchased various brands of ghee. I have also tried traditional Moroccan ghee Smen and it can be strong and tangy. I found a review of this brand on an organic/vegan website and it commented on the fresh sweetness of this ghees scent.  That review was right. This is bar none the sweetest scented butter product I have tried. Absolutely delightful. It is more expensive than other brands I have tried.  I am not sure how they process it to get this fresh sweet butter scent but I will use it in my baking when the sweet buttery scent is most noticeable. In sauteing. this delicate scent is covered by meat and or vegatable scents. If you like a tangy butter scent to cut through with an oregano tinge try Smen. Zamouri spices carries it.
11645,B0032RPLSY,A2WUMVTN16E0NX,S. Kohrherr,5/5,1329436800,Best Ghee available,This ghee is the best available -- the fat is high quality and the nutrients are powerful. due to the fact that the ghee is made from grass-fed butter during the spring and fall season. when the cows are eating fast-growing green grass. That last part is important -- that means that this ghee has high amounts of K2 compared to other ghees. K2 is the great bone and teeth-building nutrient; it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately. K2 cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables -- it can only be gotten from animal fats. organ meats. or some kinds of fermented vegetables.<br /><br />Also. apparently this ghee has tested as high in K2 as the very expensive butter oil that I used to buy.<br /><br />Finally. I've seen an improvement in my kids' teeth since I've been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day. We use it like a supplement.<br /><br />Thank you for a high quality product!
11656,B0032RPLSY,A19ZC6FX8OSTKF,jean9,2/2,1346371200,Oh. Gee. Ghee!,Great to make popcorn with! I even put some on a sweet potato. I cannot get raw butter. so I use this as a substitute.
11659,B0032RPLSY,A2HPKNMRMLLQ1K,Island Mama,2/2,1344556800,Great Ghee!,This is a great product!  It tastes really good. and I love that it's grass-fed.  I will definitely buy this again.
11666,B0032RPLSY,A2N8DOCMGG03NS,Tracy Reads Too Much,2/2,1316822400,Best Ghee Available,We started using ghee in place of oils to help our daughter with severe autism.  She appears to be in better health and mood since this change.  We have tried four different varieties of ghee. but this is the best tasting and fits into more recipes because of the mild taste. There is a big price difference. but this brand is worth the extra money.
11685,B0032RPLSY,A2XAUZP847DE5G,kinshealth,1/1,1306800000,Love this ghee!,I love love love this stuff! The company is very good about quality and the cows are grassfed. I use it for  everything. Is it pricy...yes but worth it! I'm currently out of the country and can get quality butter anywhere but thank God I packed this ghee with me. I'm so thankful for quality products like this.
11695,B0032RPLSY,A2D6CVFSHXZDXX,Abe RealPro,5/13,1306540800,Very Expensive. There are cheaper and Better Ghee than This one,Very expensive and not worth the price. Try PurityFarm Organic Ghee. it's much cheaper and taste much better than this Ghee. Don't waste your money.
11704,B0046XAL7E,A18Y7XQ9X763YJ,MedicMaria,0/0,1334620800,Popcorn,I love Orville Redenbacher and so I ordered a case. Unfortunately. It looks old and the bags are weeping butter. The popcorn tastes OK when it does fully pop. if you can get pass that...what am I saying? Buy the 3 pack and try it out first.

Why this  can not be ship to California !,Why in the world would Amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested.  when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. Wish every state would wake up like California and ban all these cancer causing things.
11724,B000O3HWN6,A2VB6JBTLMB9YC,Janssen mom of 3,4/33,1228867200,causes cancer,There is a warning for this package that it has things in it that cause cancel!!!  Why would you put cancer in your food?
11732,B00153SSZU,A2EU2KBRP9UBQL,Bread Maker BreadMaker,0/0,1290729600,My cat likes it. and so I am happy.,I am not sure if my cat loves Halo. but whenever I try to change brands. my cat looks happier going back to Halo. Like other reviewers. the poop seems to be least smelly. Also. one noticeable difference when I feed Halo is that my cat seems to eat in a controlled manner- eats throughout the day. I guess that is a good thing? When I feed other brands. my cat eats it uncontrollably all at once.
11740,B003WP05BY,A98OT5XRLY4YN,nana,4/6,1312502400,Chiclets memory,My daughter's daughter is turning 6 and wanted a bubble gum theme.  Of course MY daughter remembered growing up as well as I with the tiny size Chiclets.  We looked everywhere and found them on Amazon!!  WE were thrilled and purchased several packs to introduce it to the 6 year old's and bring back wonderful memories of Chiclets gum. Still the same wonderful product that is always was.
11761,B001E0QE4G,AADCMKNWHKQU2,LeighMD,0/0,1349913600,Best Tea on Earth (No. I don't own company stock!),Everyone in my house is addicted to this tea. We drink it iced. Make one or two pitchers of it a day. It's not sweetened. but has a subtle. natural sweetness to it. Feels refreshing and clean. It was also one of the few things I tolerated well when I was pregnant and routinely nauseated. I've heard this from other mothers too. Love it.
11771,B00099XLJE,AVIYHPBLQVBGB,Clara mystery fan,3/4,1163030400,Walnuts -- good for you.,After reading so many healthy things about walnuts. we try to eat some everyday.  Buying them from Amazon with our prime shipping is so much cheaper than buying them from our local grocery store.  Nuts keep nicely in the freezer.  Toasting them in a 350 degree oven for 10-12 minutes makes them taste gourmet-ish.
11788,B001225KGO,A1GDCN7XH52BGW,bk26,2/2,1238630400,Great flavor,I use this product whan I make Honey Jalapeno ribs. Gives a nice mild smoke flavor. Great price on this also.
11791,B001225KGO,A2JSPDQHE63OSV,monsieurpatric monsieurpatric,1/1,1322179200,As jumbo plastic jars of Ancho go...,The problem with Ancho chili is its scarcity in commercial markets.  We don't have ready recourse to a decent Mexican mercado. a sadness. so I turned to Amazon.  There is simply something wonderful combining Ancho and maple syrup for a splendid porc chop sauce. for example. I'm grateful.  So are the happy palates around here.
11797,B004P4TL8E,A3C6A40RHKRZBV,Evan Galatz,0/1,1331164800,Ok solution. depending on your kitchen set up,I purchased this product over a year ago. and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me. but could be perfect for you.<br /><br />I used to always reach up to the top shelf. grab my box of k-cups. sift through them to find what I wanted. and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box. but when you can only hold 20. and you use multiple k-cups per day. I just felt like I was always filling it. and didnt have enough room for variety.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect. holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets. it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that. but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw. but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead. since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it. this option is beyond perfect. However for me. I feel like it just added a bit of clutter. but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer.
11804,B004P4TL8E,A3RRVAPZKF6EPX,SBrewster,29/30,1299801600,I get my counter space back!,I can finally get rid of the five boxes of K-cups sitting on my counter.  The padded top of the drawer shelf means I don't get a rattling vibration noise when the brewer runs. and the drawer slide action is very smooth.  The drawer extends far enough out that it's easy to get the last cup in a row. so you can see all the cups at once - much better than digging around in a bunch of boxes.  The whole thing feels very sturdy. and has a nice modern look to it.
11844,B004P4TL8E,A2CPY9C7UIO65C,Lindsey,0/0,1347062400,Exactly what I wanted!,This drawer is very sturdy (as long as it's on a flat surface) and holds plenty of K cups. It's great because it doesn't use your counter space and even with my heavy CuisinArt K cup coffee maker on top. it still slides in and out very easily. Love it!
11848,B004P4TL8E,A37B78QSHDLNBA,ces,0/0,1346803200,It is what it is,Sturdy. well made. convenient. Fits well under the Keurig machine and does not take extra space. Easy pull out drawer to view coffee choices
11849,B004P4TL8E,A34CE623TDL7LU,E. Russo,0/0,1346716800,HA!  This thing is AWESOME.,This drawer is just awesome for holding the K-cups when the boxes get nearly empty. and it seems pointless to store them on the shelf.  It keeps the k-cups nice and dry and handy.  Best of all is that the machine can rest safely on the top. giving it it's own little area in the kitchen. kind of like a little break room.  We love this. and the shelf we bought to hang on the wall to hold the boxes.
11869,B004P4TL8E,A1IH42TUIZ2XJL,G. K. Libbey,0/0,1327795200,K-cup storage & Stand for Coffee Brewer,I use my storage drawer for my assorted k- cups and my Keurig sits ATP the storage drawer. It has an easy clean top and is attractive and practical.
11872,B004P4TL8E,A1U9L1EU5O6DW2,Jean F. Johnson,0/0,1326499200,Keurig Coffee Tray,Tray fits perfectly under the coffee maker.  Color compliments color of coffee maker.  Non-skid top keeps coffee maker in place. Drawer is ventilated.  Ample storage space.  Love it.
11873,B004P4TL8E,A3N1XZUZOTIOT8,Annaliese Franzen,0/0,1326412800,SO handy!,I love products that reduce clutter. are functional. and don't hurt your eyes to look at. I really like this drawer. I have it beneath my Cuisinart Keurig K-Cup Mini Brewing System. It's sturdy enough to hold the coffee maker. This is a product I would highly recommend!!
11888,B004P4TL8E,A3AM3Y79F7VROY,Matt Pinkham,0/0,1305676800,Perfect For What I Was Looking For,I was originally looking for Keurig coffee on Amazon and stumbled across this gem.  I bought it for work to centralize my coffee stuff and it has been perfect - k-cups. stirrers. sweetener packets. all fit nicely in one place...right below my Keurig!  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the dividers in the drawer were solid so stirrers didn't have a chance to roll around. but since I can tell it was originally designed to only hold k-cups I can't complain.  Great for saving space and looks nicer than the tall. spice rack looking k-cup holders out there - would def recommend.
11890,B004P4TL8E,A3TESEEBLEW37W,Kevin Robert Johnson,0/0,1304985600,Great storage,Good storage of the K-Cups as well as enough storage so that it can support my Keurig coffee maker.  It easily solved the problem of how to store all my K-Cups much better than the rotating tower.
11897,B000SSXTAM,A2JPFQ3LQUVAAZ,D. K. Smith,2/2,1327881600,Silver Pearl Dust,The silver pearl dust is reasonably easy to use. please use a light and careful touch. I used this to decorate spritz cookies. I used the tree mold. and the cookies were lovely and tasty!
11899,B000SSXTAM,A3SBMGUN4U006A,Amanda Phillips Proud Mom of Two,2/3,1256169600,Beautiful Results,The product came in a small vile and I honestly thought that there wouldn't be enough to dust all of the cookies with it. To my surprise. I ended up making more cookies than originally planned. dusted them with the pearl dust. and had so much of it left over! I was so amazed at how far this stuff goes! It gave the cookies such a beautiful finish!
11902,B001SB4VSC,AMRMK86X3PKXD,R. Thomasson,0/0,1300492800,The best chipotle in refried beans...How can you go wrong?,San Marcos is by far the best brand of chipotle in adobo. Take that wonderful. smokey flavor and add it to refried beans and it's a no-brainer. These are a great medium hot bean.
11905,B001CD1VI4,A3HY6C05DIMNP7,V. Lopez,4/5,1267488000,Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies,So far. I have tried caramel apple. fruit & nut. morning glory. and banana walnut flavers. I have also ordered. (but not yet received) the pumpkin spice cookies. All of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack. The ingredients are wholesome. there is no high fructose corn syrup. and they have a good supply of protein & fiber to stave off hunger for several hours. The caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest. but I really love all of the flavors. Like other reviewers. I freeze them. and then microwave a cookie for 20 seconds when I am ready to eat it. I find the cookies taste best warmed up. Even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies. I think you get a lot of nutritional value with these.
11911,B001CD1VI4,A11VK79G41FSU6,C. Dixon,3/4,1250380800,These are awesome,Sue. I think you got a bad batch. these are awesome! I have ordered them three times now and each time they have been soft. tasty. and easily slide out of the bags. I sincerely think you got a bum pack. I have tried a couple of other flavors too but prefer this one over the others. The cookies are healthy and fast and most of all. taste great.
11920,B001CD1VI4,A16BRHVNCGM91Y,Carol J. Rowe,1/2,1280880000,Breakfast,This is another great Breakfasr Cookie from Erin. would definately buy again. Great to carry when you must skip a meal.

I followed the supplied helpful hint to toast the cookies on the darkest setting.  Memories of my Grandmother's winter cookies warm from the oven commenced...tasty. toasty. outside and warm soft inside. These are yummy with a tall glass of the coldest milk or a hot coffee-to-go. I would buy these again.

The cookies are very moist and they are also very filling. The only thing I didn't like about these is the strong nutmeg taste.  Unfortunately. nutmeg is not my favorite spice.  I would have enjoyed more raisins but my kids are glad there aren't that many.  I love the fact that I can keep these handy for mornings when we are running late and for when we take trips.  They are easy to freeze and seem to keep rather well in the freezer.
11963,B001VIWUTE,A1DWRDPYR4F3VG,Vanessa Chial,1/5,1320105600,Only got 5 packs!,It clearly states on the description. pack of 6!  But I only got 5!  And I cannot find how to complain about this.  I don't want to return.

11991,B0000T15M8,A1L43KWWR05PCS,Lawyeraau,3/3,1092528000,AN OLD-FASHIONED CANDY...,When I was young. nearly a half century ago. Chuckles was a very popular candy. I really enjoyed eating these jellied treats. which were dusted with granulated sugar.  as they definitely satisfied a sweet tooth. I still enjoy them on occasion. though they are not as easy to find as in the old days. having waned somewhat in popularity. My particular favorite was the cherry flavor. If they had sold an all cherry pack. I would have bought them by the ton. Luckily for me. an all cherry pack was not available.  I also enjoyed the licorice and orange flavors. Lemon and lime. however.  were the flavors that I liked least. so I would benevolently offer them to my younger sisters. I was all heart in those days.
11995,B0026JSFUK,A120P0MIV4OALC,P. Gowen,0/0,1348444800,Great for kids,These taste terrific and my grandkids call them candy bars and consider them a special treat!  They prefer the chocolate chip - I love the dark chocolate almond!
11997,B000NMDWSM,AKMBDKZUSJHBC,uglyluggage,0/0,1313452800,Finally,For the longest time they would not ship this to APOs. I don't know why. Maybe they were afraid the yummy super bubble gum would fall into the hands of the enemy. Get flavor and one piece works. I chew gum every day in the gym because I grind my teeth when lifting. helps alot.

I am a big fan of jelly beans and these are now my favorite. perfect mix of flavors (good and...mysterious).

I feel a tad guilty buying 10 at at time at the local co-op but they are simply the best tasting sardines. distinctive and flavorful. You know you are buying premium product compared to the plethora of sardine purveyors out there: Nordic. Portugal. Mediterranean. etc...The cool waters off the California are well known for sardines
12047,B003H7YHUW,AY12DBB0U420B,Gary Peterson,1/1,1345075200,Excellent Sardines.,For lunch today. I had a can of Wild Planet wild sardines packed in Extra Virgin olive oil. I served them over a bowl of brown rice and I pored much of the olive oil onto the mixture. For a bit of flavoring. I added a small amount of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce. an Asian treat from Thailand. Good lunch. Good mix of nutritional ingredients. Excellent sardines. by the way. Really good tasting.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

12077,B001EQ4LEA,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,Peggy pab920,9/10,1236988800,Great base!,I was a huge fan of PDQ eggnog crystals and was sad when this product quit being produced. I happened upon this product and I'm so glad I took a chance. At first I made just one glassful and enjoyed it but something was missing and some of the crystals did not completely dissolve. I decided to make a half gallon of 1% organic milk in it's carton while adding nutmeg. cinnamon. and 2 tsp. of organic vanilla. I let it refrigerate over night and what a difference. Now it tastes more like real eggnog and is such an inexpensive easy to make year round treat. So today I will order another 9 pack or maybe 2 since one never knows how long a product will be stocked. Also AMZN definitively has the BEST price as other charge three dollars for ONE container. ENJOY!

12180,B00141UC9I,A5L504DA1XL6F,Christian Stone,0/1,1267660800,Good deal on a great item!,Well first. my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed. and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well. it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good. and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy. and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here. and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China. and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people. and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can. I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing. and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However. they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point. and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking. the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog. a Golden Retriever. he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could. and not think twice about doing it again the next day.

The product is not only loved by my precious babies. but it does not smell bad. it is easy to store and handle. and makes a difference in the way they feel.  One of my dogs has some hip problems. I have noticed a difference in the way he gets around.  Truly a WONDERFUL product. I will continue to buy these products and try more of the other things made by Dogswell!

We could not figure out what was wrong at first. Eventually we realized the treats might be making him sick. We stopped feeding him happy hips and he almost immediately got better. We threw them out. Stay very far away from this product.
12246,B00141UC9I,A2P4Y0FIZBQBIC,Teresa T. Stephenson,1/1,1331683200,MADE IN CHINA,Okay. a lot of chicken breast treats from China are causing dogs to be sick (see the FDA website for details).  This is not one of them. but when I started buying it. it was made in the USA.  Now it's made in China.  Although my dogs have long loved this treat. I'm in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country.

They're nice & chewy.<br />I read food labels constantly. and it helps to be able to read the ingredients before purchasing on Amazon.  Also. buying Dogswell in bulk (15oz./pks of 3) as Amazon offers. is the best deal I have found. so far.  My 13yr. old. 33lb. dog gets 3 chicken strips a day.  The rest of the 15oz. pkg. goes into the freezer. whereupon the next day I'm able to snap each strip into thirds - that's how Ranger Bob (my dog) likes it.  Might not be a bad idea to offer it this way for smaller dogs.  Oh. and one last thing. Ranger Bob will bury pig ears. real bones. biscuits.green bones etc. but not these Dogswell strips!

12303,B0009XQSAY,AXJ1QYBUL86ON,HarpswellWoman HarpswellWoman,1/1,1297382400,Great product to have in your cupboard and a good price,Update:  Please note per my information below: product description and photo are no longer accurate.  The product has a sealed lid. not a pop-top lid and the amount of protein and sodium have changed.  See below for the correct information.  I have notified Amazon of this error.  Somehow 5 grams of protein have been lost from the can contents.<br /><br />I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one. get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can).  This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more.<br />I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat.  This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use.  The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item.  The meat flakes into small pieces easily. so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it.  It would also make a good filling for enchiladas. tortillas or quesadillas.  I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product.  It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks.  For those who don't like tuna. it's a great alternative.<br />Basically. it's chicken when you need it ready to go. and it is a good source of protein with very little fat.  One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories. 9 grams of protein. 1 gram of fat. 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV). 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?).  If sodium is a concern. consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer.<br />It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long!  It's fresh when you need it.  I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some)<br />Update:<br />Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese.<br />I haven't tried the concoction yet. but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast.
12304,B0009XQSAY,A3CON26JT9UT80,George Thomas,5/7,1218499200,Damaged goods,At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged. so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer. and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks. knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK.
12307,B0009XQSAY,A2MNB77YGJ3CN0,L. Mountford,0/0,1332115200,Great shelf staple ...,I used this a lot for white bean / chicken chili. chicken salad. fettuccine alfredo with chicken and mushrooms.  The flavor is very good. it's low-fat. the sodium count isn't outrageous. and it works well with a lot of things.  Yes. I prefer using fresh chicken breast. but when I don't have any on hand or can't get to the store. this works very well.

Maybe they're not quite as fresh. been around in the warehouse too long or something?  Because these were not near as good as the other Virginia Peanuts I've had or ordered from Amazon in the past.  The Royal Oak in the blue can is what I got last time and they were much larger. not broken. crunchier. and just better tasting.  Seemed silly to return 2/3 of the order. and they are not really awful. completly fine actually. but my expectations were for a premium product. Fairly decent peanut. but these are suposed to be the best.  They were not.  Going to order the Royal Oak next time.
12356,B0028A8ZEI,A1PH0X4J3TODO9,t19p5,0/0,1347062400,Best peanuts I've had so far in my life,These are the best tasting peanuts I've so far had in my life.  They possibly could the best peanuts ever but I haven't tried all of them yet so I'll hedge my review there.  The peanuts are crunchy and fresh and just right salty.  So much better than anything I can buy in my local supermarket. which stocks only large brands like Planters.  There is a reason these are more expensive - the taste is superior. it's just on a different level.  Try these. I bet you won't be able to eat another supermarket peanut again.

There was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. At least the peanuts were OK. Maybe we are being sold seconds through Amazon by this company. Buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company.
12383,B000DZH1A4,AZRNGDUE0TPZF,Kathleen Hawk,2/2,1239235200,My new favorite cookie from Pamela's,I've been eating gluten free for about seven years. and a couple of Pamela's cookies with a cup of decaf have gotten me through my 4 p.m. low many times in those years. When I first discovered them. I loved all the shortbread styles. Then I moved into the chocolate chip versions. Most recently it was the peanut butter. with and without chips.<br /><br />I love them all. but this raisin and walnut cookie may be my all-time favorite. It's tender. chewy and generously studded with nuts and raisins. Unlike some of the others. which can be a little sweet for my taste. this one seems to rely on the raisins more than sugar for sweetness. After eating one or two. I feel like I've eaten something that might be good for me (and not just totally self-indulgent).<br /><br />Like all the Pamela's cookies. they're a little pricey. but the prices here on Amazon are definitely the best I've found. (Likewise for the Bob's Red Mill GF bread mixes. which are also wonderful.) Thanks. Amazon. for your great selection of GF foods.

In the past couple of years. our local grocer has stopped carrying them. we would request them. they would get them for a few months. and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk. cold milk. or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

They had it on sale for $4.99 a bag so I bought four bags -- can't beat that price. right? I figured. how bad could it be?<br /><br />It is beyond bad. First. if this is French Roast coffee than I'm Angelina Jolie. There is not on identifiably French Roast aspect about it. The taste is nothing short of horrid. I tried making a pot with more coffee and one with less coffee. Nothing worked -- it's just awful.<br /><br />I am taking back the three unopened bags as this is just undrinkable. I threw the open bag away.<br /><br />This is how bad it is: I have a can of Folger's in my pantry for those emergency mornings when you wake up and learn you're out of coffee. I poured out the Gevalia and made a pot of Folgers and it was better than the Gevalia. Since Folger's is barely drinkable. imagine how horrid Gevalia is.<br /><br />Save your money. It's not even worth buying when it's on sale.

The thing about this product is its vibrance. which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you. but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it. sure would. After all what do you have to lose. the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.

I pop these like candy. and I don't think I'm the only one ;).<br /><br />These are really minty. but not as minty as the peppermint one. which I find too strong. to the point that it creates discomfort. So I love these. because its pretty powerful stuff. but not overwhelming. One thing I love about Altoids mints. is that when you first put one in your mouth. you get this pleasant sweet taste. and it slowly moves on to being minty. all without a sugar crust.<br /><br />The mints themselves are mainly shaped very nicely. but every now and then their deformed a little or cracked. (Which somehow adds to the traditional-ness.)<br /><br />The tin was great. kept the mints in there securely. I've never gotten a bad tin and there would be no reason to.<br /><br />I suggest these to anyone who likes mints. or has bad breath of any sort. These are just great.

She had a lackluster appetite before Merrick came into our home.  I found it at a local organic pet store.  Their price was ridiculous - nearly $3 per can.  I bought a few to try -  I was amazed at the results!  I haven't seen my 75 lb. dog jump vertical with glee in many years.  I mix it with her dry food.  One can will last 3-4 days.  The difference in her level of activity and enthusiasm is unbelievable!  I went to the local store to negotiate their price on buying bulk based on what I could get it on line and the best they could do was a 10% discount.  Needless to say. this seller has a customer for the life of my dog.  Kudos to improving our quality of life at a reasonable price.  This food is so great. I have been tempted to taste the spoon!

Plus a garden variety of fresh vegetables when I read the label. Sounds like good eats to me. No complaints from the poochie and I think it's way better quality than what some of the 'big' dog food makers are dishing out. I usually mix a small quantity with the dry food and it keeps my dog happy and grateful.

I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!! Wow shipping was a little high. I figured it was due to the special shipping of meat.

Sneed No love but nothing close to hate.,6/6,1269734400,My favorite hotsauce,I'm not the biggest fan of hotsauces but I was interested in trying this one because the singer of The Offspring is the man that created the sauce and sells it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good the sauce tastes. it's got some kick but not too much kick. I really really love this stuff.<br /><br />I would especially recommend it on Papa Murphy's Herb Chicken Mediterranean pizza. amazing.<br /><br />I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because I've ordered it on their site directly from them for a long time and this is a few dollars cheaper and it's still directly from the same company.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle.
12773,B0030MNHEG,A39D9PPFB8JOWV,BPHotard,1/1,1301529600,Amazing hot sauce. you won't regret,Like many people who have bought this sauce. I decided to pay the extra nickel to try the hot sauce created by none other than one of my favorite singers from one of my favorite bands growing up. The Offspring.And like many of those who have purchased online. this sauce isn't available in stores near us.<br /><br />First off. I am a native of New Orleans. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about hot sauces. Tabasco. Crystal. and many other hot sauces that have had heart and soul put into them have made their way onto my plate. But man........Dexter hit the money on this one. This sauce is truly amazing. for lack of better words. You get a burst of flavor when you first bite into your dish covered in Bandito. then a nice after rush of spice hits the tongue for a great ending. I really haven't found a dish that it doesn't go good on.<br /><br />I was skeptic at first. as I knew going in that I was only buying it because I was a fan of The Offspring. But I can tell you now. that this sauce is officially a household staple in my home. This is literally the best hot sauce i have EVER had. Try it!
12784,B0030MNHEG,A2LEYFDG1OGP2V,MnM,0/0,1311724800,Love it,The Offspring being my favorite band. I had to try this. It has a really good taste. and I can't get over Dexter on the label. XD<br />  PS- on their website. it has a recipe for beer mixed with some Gringo Bandito. For all the minors. just use coke. Not only is it good. but the reaction on people's face when you tell them it's mixed with hot sauce is priceless.<br />  And finally. my personal favorite is a Wahoos' fish taco with a lot of GB on it. THAT is amazing.
12785,B0030MNHEG,A17P8V5YU6QGW9,InHocMLM,0/0,1310515200,This stuff is delicious!,I am a huge hot sauce fan. on top of being a huge health fanatic. I decided to try this out because I heard about it on my favorite bands website. the Offspring. As this is made by their lead singer. I was intrigued. The thing that made me want to try this the most is the great reviews and the fact that it has a low amount of sodium compared to many other hot sauces.<br /><br />I was not dissapointed at all! This stuff is absolutely delicious. I seriously put it on everything. I keep a bottle in my office with me for my lunch everyday. I seriously can't get over how good this stuff is. It reminds me of a more tasty taco bell hot sauce initially. then the tangyness kicks in. next thing you know the burn of the spicy habanero is there. Seriously is delicious and not just spicy enough to not be too spicy for someone who isn't big on spicy food. I highly recommend this hot sauce for its delicious taste and its low sodium.<br /><br />Things I put it on...<br /><br />-Egg Whites<br />-Talapia<br />-chicken<br />-rice<br /><br />Makes all the plain tasting healthy food I eat bearable and delicious!

12856,B001EQ5LT4,A1PA2K3GMGIE5V,CA,7/7,1265414400,Crunchy and Fabulous,As my husband enjoys the large crunchy Virginia peanuts I ordered Royal Oak salted peanuts and peanuts from the Peanut Shop of Williamsburg for him.  Hands down. Royal Oak Peanuts in the blue tin are the best choice.  They are very large. crunchy and fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt. The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg peanuts we found to be smaller and they appeared to have an oily film over them.  Not nearly as fresh tasting as Royal Oak Blue label Virginia peanuts. These Royal Oak Peanuts are expensive but worth the treat.  We used to get the Costco brand(Kirkland) of large Virginia peanuts but they have stopped supplying them as of about nine months ago.  I would definitely recommend Royal Oak Peanuts.

12915,B0036FOV2O,A21GE1X9W90IPJ,Pete,0/0,1334880000,Highly Strung East African,I have a soft spot for this coffee.<br />As mentioned before. it has no subtlety. and you won't be picking-out notes of blackcurrant or orange blossom or whatever - this is highly roasted stuff that just tastes of strong. strong coffee. I've had plenty of supermarket coffees in the past that were terrible due to being over-roasted to death (perhaps to disguise rubbish beans). Somehow this Costco Rwandan one works though. as a straightforward rich. bitter coffee. It's so charred that when I put it in my hand-grinder the beans just kind of shattered. giving no resistance.<br />Its main selling selling point for me is that it works nicely as a robust espresso (in my Solis Crema SL90). and as a punchy filter-coffee.<br />PS it's cheap.<br />Mmm.

12925,B007HP9T5S,A3OGYXV9S7MJHM,Rita Lonie,0/0,1336608000,Leggo my Mango!,After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha. I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least. the way I did it). but it was so. so worth it. Still. I hate messy food. so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess. I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors. but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it. it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had. a faint hint of bitterness. and I got worried. Still. never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me. and thank goodness I did. it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is. but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced. so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit. I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids. so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still. it will be no great hardship to finish this off. especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible. it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!

12933,B001SAQDYS,ATUFINZCIVODV,W. Curtin,4/5,1324857600,At last!!!,I've tried all sorts of bottled and canned pizza sauces for years.  None were better than mediocre and some were really awful.  I would always go back to my polpo which I make with a base of Muir Glen diced tomatoes - tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking.  Finally tried the Pastorelli.  BOY IS IT GOOD!!!!<br />Good tomatoey flavor. not over-herbed or garliced. not salty. and it held together when cooking rather than soggying up my crust.  My new best tomato friend.  2TB or so wii suffice for a pizza.  Great stuff!!!
12934,B001SAQDYS,A2CC7OO0C58C01,Jim Hurster,0/0,1350345600,Unbelievably the best sauces ever....hands down.,As a self proclaimed pizza expert. originating from St. Louis. then residing in Chicago. and sampling pizza around the nation. at some of the most prized pizza joints in the country. as well as international attempts...I began making my own pizza's again..this time using Pastorelli's own pizza crusts (thin. crispy style) and the different varieties of Pastorelli's sauces.  The full flavor and balance of spices in this stuff is fabulous enough to literally 'eat if from the can'.  Seriously.  What amazed me is that I have asked dozens of pizza shop owners. and new restaurant 'attempts' at pizza recipes. what sauce they use....many going with food service items from wholesalers (Pastorelli DOES sell food service quantities).  Bland is the word with many sauces. and some too strong in their spices.  This family owned business has this science and art nailed down. and the quality of all of Pastorelli products is premium. without a high price tag.  If you want to really enjoy the best home made pizza. then Pastorelli's pizza sauces are the ONLY way to go.  Buy a can. jar (squeeze). and grab some of their new crusts. and then make up your own recipes and see for yourself.  The sauce 'carries' the pizza.  Their pasta sauces are amazing. yet not easy to find....hopefully their distribution will expand.  Personally. I love Amazon....so I'm set.

The mexican version tastes better that the American version. This one ACTUALLY tastes like chocolate milk!  It is richer. and you can taste the chocolate in it. To me it tastes like the American version before they changed the formula to the new less sugar formula. which is strange because now the American version tastes way too sweet and it doesn't even taste like chocolate. It taste like plain ole nothing except maybe milk that is too sweet to drink. If you like chocolate milk. buy this version.  Its the only one my family will drink.

13115,B002TMV34E,AOODNGLAEDN76,Robert H. Knox,2/2,1277510400,Nice Cup O' Joe,I've been a fan of the Melitta system for years. It's simple. and eliminates the expense of an<br />appliance. For one or two persons. it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket. but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely. almost to a powder consistency. which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind. but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step. I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee. the Classique Supreme. has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black. it has a smoky. vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup. which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey. and there may well be better gourmet coffees<br />out there. but it works for me. and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents.
13116,B002TMV34E,A6B92PTV0Z1SU,P. Kingsriter R.N. Guy,2/2,1277337600,Bold + Smooth - Acid = A Winner,I am honestly. pleasantly surprised by Melitta's Classique Supreme blend.  I was expecting a grocery-store quality coffee. but it far surpasses anything I've purchased at my local supermarket and. interestingly enough. I like it better than most beans I've purchased at specialty coffee shops.  Here's why:<br /><br />It's got a bold flavor akin to Kenyan beans but has a rich. full. smooth (almost chocolatey) texture like Sumatra.  As if combining the best bits of my favorite coffee regions wasn't enough. it's a very low acidity coffee. almost completely lacking that bitter / burnt aftertaste that plagues so many dark blends.  It's not a bright coffee like those grown in Latin America.  I believe this blend of coffee would be absolutely PERFECT FOR DESSERT SERVICE. but shouldn't necessarily be limited there.<br /><br />I've brewed a few pots at work to rave reviews.  Even the barely-colored-water-that-she-calls-coffee gal shrugged and said it was good.  I'm not inclined to drink my coffee black. but this blend is smooth enough to be palatable. even for me.  In fact. I surprised myself by enjoying my first 10oz cup with no creams or sweetener.  Pretty remarkable stuff.<br /><br />At its current price point. it'll end up being a bit more expensive but of far better overall quality than your average grocery store. but may be comparable (or even cheaper) than your local coffee shop.  If you like a smooth. flavorful coffee. Melitta's Classique Supreme blend is a safe bet for a very enjoyable cup o' joe.
13121,B002TMV34E,A3QVAKVRAH657N,Orrin C. Judd brothersjudddotcom,1/1,1277596800,SMOOTH. FOR BETTER AND WORSE,I learned to drink coffee black and cheap and have never varied much from that.  Strong is fine so long as it isn't bitter.  Complexity is okay if you can find it cheap or if someone else is paying for the cup. but there's no need to get carried away.  It's just coffee.<br /><br />This Melitta brand (Cafe Collection Classique Supreme) is quite smooth and tasty.  If the cost was comparable to the big cans of Chock Full o'Nuts at BJ's I'd happily buy it.  But it just doesn't taste enough better for it to cost much more.
13128,B002TMV34E,AJ3K3HKR9UFVN,J. Kelley dahozho,0/0,1306368000,Nice for a medium roast,This is a good coffee for people who don't like their brew all that strong.

I like the grind. which is finer than most ground coffee. although I prefer grinding the beans myself.  It has a bold. but not bitter. taste.  Even though I'll stick to Eight O'Clock as my coffee of choice. this one certainly isn't objectionable and is better than most cups you'll get at the diner.  And it's certainly better than Folgers. MH. and other grocery store brands.

Kolin Third Degree member since 1991,0/0,1278892800,OK. but not great,I have become somewhat of a coffee snob over the years and consider it one of the few grocery items that I will pay top dollar for if it suits my taste. My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast. so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.<br /><br />While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma. it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best. a perfect cup. in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests. who thought it was just okay.<br /><br />So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay. but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind. which I like. but the bean is not very dark. The brewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend. give this a try.
13162,B002TMV34E,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,atmj,0/0,1278720000,Smooth rich coffee. but better with my proportions,Smooth rich coffee. comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions. I prefer with my coffee maker.<br />Often I find. when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee. I find it too strong.  This was no exception.<br />I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water. which would have been about 21-22 teaspoons. Slightly different. but harsher tasting.<br /><br />All in all a good cup of coffee.
13176,B002TMV34E,A12J7R7GAJ5FBZ,Charles M. Nobles,0/0,1278288000,It took a while,When I first tried this coffee it had a dark. rich. overly strong flavor and color. In fact it was a bit bitter and was definately not a blend I would recommend. I decided to work with the amount used for each pot and ultimately ended up using less than recommended and it turned out to be very good. I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this brand but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong. rich blend this is the coffee for you. By using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong. rich. flavorful cup of very good coffee. The fine grind is a nice touch and gives one the feeling that all of the ground beans are being used. Definately a vast improvement over the usual store varieties. Give it a try and chance's are it will grow on you.
13177,B002TMV34E,A350EKKR7ZWBFE,Michael Bigger,0/0,1278288000,Comparing it to Julius Meinl Coffee,My wife is Austrian and her favorite coffee is the Julius Meinl coffee. We like this coffee so much that we order it from Vienna (in our opinion it rates 5 stars). In order to test how good this coffee is. I substituted the Julius Meinl coffee with the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme. My wife drank her coffee and did not say anything. When I told her about the substitution she was quite surprised and she asks about how expensive the Melitta is. Ordering coffee from Vienna is very expensive.<br /><br />In my opinion. this coffee is slightly (very subtle difference) inferior to the Julius Meinl which is our gold standard. Given that the Melitta is much cheaper we will be buying this coffee in the future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
13180,B002TMV34E,A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,Iron Man JON,0/0,1277942400,One of the best!,I drink coffee everyday but I prefer home-brewed compared to those that you buy at the coffee shop. By doing so. you conform it more to your desired taste and strength and it is healthier. without the calorie packed extras you get from the regular coffee shop. Upon opening the package. the aroma is instantly enticing. You can tell right away just by the scent that it is gourmet coffee. Upon brewing. this is where it gets you salivating. The fine-ground Arabica variety of this coffee instantly gives you a strong craving from the Once you pour smell. it on the cup and have a sip. it gives a satisfying taste. bold and rich. trademarks of a true gourmet coffee.
13197,B002TMV34E,A235UFZGCFN3J5,Eva,0/0,1277251200,A very good medium roast blend,I'm a big coffee drinker so I'm quite picky about the brands and roasts I buy. This Melitta coffee is a medium roast. very smooth and not bitter. The grind is very fine so I was expecting it to be strong or espresso-like. but it turned out to be a nicely balanced medium blend. I prefer this type of coffee to the brands that are overly strong and have a burnt taste. Just make sure to follow the instructions on the bag for the amount of coffee per water. You can adjust more or less coffee based on your preferences. If you're making it as iced. use a little extra coffee. I'm glad I found this brand for a nice everyday coffee.
13207,B005P0U1B8,A3GQQBM0NP6V93,Morgaine,0/0,1332460800,Yummy,My kids & I love these. they are like rice krispie treats but not as sweet. similar texture and a great snack.
13209,B0049LUEKC,AHMLWB0J0L20R,asiel,2/2,1334188800,first time taster,This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter. however. i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky. takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks. i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware. this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds.
13213,B0049LUEKC,A20C1E3XNPCE5A,Ron B reb52,0/1,1342483200,I did not like this,When I bought this I was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor.  Its not close.  I suppose if you can't eat peanuts this might be an alternative but I would look at other nut butters.
13218,B0038RLIYO,A3DKGFF0SDWT4O,K. Reed MFvideos,4/4,1309910400,Best flavor yet,This is about the 5th type of Xylitol sweetener I have tried.  I threw away most of the previous one.  So when I received this Ideal I was skeptical...well...it is delicious!  No off-taste. just wonderful.
13222,B0038RLIYO,A1NB0PS5WPSRS2,Mrs. TLJ,1/1,1332720000,Taste like sugar,I know many people say a lot of artificial sweeteners taste like sugar and don't. but this does.  If you sprinkle a little in your hand and taste it. it's amazing how much it taste just like sugar.  Would of given it 5 stars if more sugar came in the box for the same price.
13223,B0038RLIYO,AD2M8ASWO7M36,LETTIE,1/1,1324857600,pleasure without calories,Great product. First no calorie sweetner that tastes like real sugar. Works great for baking. We are two diabetics and I bake cakes. including cheese cake. banana bread. pies and cookies. Can't tell the difference. Love it in my tea too.
13234,B003ZXFX2E,A23Z6XD0ELE8S0,Elvira,0/0,1335916800,Wonderful Taste but Mostly Broken Crackers,I bought this box of crackers for a party at home but when I opened it. most of the crackers in the box were broken. Other reviewers seems to be getting only 50% broken but mine was more like 80-90% broken. Definitely not for serving.<br /><br />Now. if you are not buying it for serving and just for your own munching. I'd definitely give it at least 4 stars. Great crunchy taste and the sea salt is just heavenly!
13238,B007L4A77E,A37P70CYO32G1D,Domenica187,0/0,1345161600,Cheap eggs are cheap.,These plastic eggs are terrible quality.  I bought them to use as centers for my classroom.  I don't expect they will last much wear and tear with students because the plastic is thin. the hinges are weak. and there are even holes in some of the eggs.  I would NOT buy this product again.  I would DEFINITELY not buy these eggs for Easter to put inside it--the eggs feel dirty and filmy and it would creep me out to put candy inside them.  There's a reason these are some of the most inexpensive--the quality is sub-par and disappointing.
13256,B004OLKF60,AKAG7S746ID1E,AnonReader,0/0,1341100800,bitter hot. but great for iced,At first I thought I had wasted my money. I hated this coffee. It is very bitter. Then I had a great idea...use it for iced coffee.  I brew it for a medium cup. Fill a tall glass with ice. Fill glass 1/3 full with milk. Add your favorite creamer. Add coffee and stir. So if you hate this coffee hot. try it cold.
13261,B004OLKF60,AUON7WG0LQPB4,Indy Papa Chuck,0/0,1330646400,Finally!,My wife is a coffee snob ( she calls herself that too) and we have browsed Amazon for K cups for  a couple years. We must have purchased every dark French Roast there is. All the coffee was good but just was not it until we ordered this coffee. Finally a coffee dark. bold enough yet smooth and not bitter. She even runs it thru the machine twice and still gets a good cup of coffee. May cost a little more than others we have purchased but well worth it. Now when re-ordering I can just go to my last coffe order and re-order same. Simple. quick and satisfing. Plus it has a cool picture of the Eifle Tower on the box.
13270,B004OLKF60,A3NVNHJ1SJW080,E. Vanketel,0/3,1333843200,Bitter and acidic!,Got this k-cup in a selection that came with my new Keurig. I usually make the small. 6 oz. cup. The resulting brew was so bitter and acrid that is was undrinkable... not just bad. Thinking that I must have done something wrong I tried again.....this time making a 12 ouncer......absolutely no difference. It tasted distinctly burnt! I was very disappointed as I like strong coffee and. usually. Italian style roast is my favorite. I would give this one a pass.......
13279,B00474HER2,A33W8RH6ZXLOR0,Moobs,4/7,1344211200,Ahh. the smell of horse shit conveniently sealed and preserved within a can...,I like pizza.  But regular pizza literally destroys my body (celiac disease and dairy allergy - yes. it does suck).  So my love of food has driven me to learn how to make decent versions of food I like which are gluten and dairy free.  I am now a MASTER pizza chef. to put it modestly.  Practically a PIZZA GOD.  I've got the pizza stone. the piel. found the best gf crust. the best df cheese. and the result is usually pretty great.<br /><br />ANYWAY...<br /><br />I like mushrooms on my pizza. specifically SLICED mushrooms. and I make pizza at home often enough that checking out at the grocery store with 20 or 30 cans of sliced mushrooms draws awkward stares.  The solution. of course. is to order in bulk via Amazon.  Have done this many times. trying out different brands. etc.  I'm almost certain I'd purchased this exact product in the past with no issues...but this latest shipment brought with it a harrowing ordeal involving smelly mushrooms and untopped pizzas.<br /><br />At first I thought I might have gotten a bad can. so I tossed the first stinky one.  Then the next one smelled just as bad.  Now - the smell isn't a rotten smell or an unnatural smell.  The best way I can describe it is a combination of normal canned mushroom smell and... horse shit.  If you don't know what horse shit smells like just imagine dog shit with a lot of hay and some mud mixed in.  So I stopped there and made my pizza without toppings.<br /><br />The next day or two when I made another pizza I decided maybe my sense of smell had been off before and to try opening another can of mushrooms from the same case.  Same fecal smell.  Even after extensive rinsing it smelled like I had been rinsing the mushrooms in an unflushed toilet bowl.  I had my wife smell the can (oh. she LOVES being asked to smell-check gross stuff...actually. no).  She agreed with the horse shit description.  I put the remaining cans back on a high shelf far out of sight.<br /><br />When next I went to the grocery store (actually. Target I think) I got a couple cans of Green Giant sliced mushrooms and later when I used them on a pizza they smelled totally normal and free of ungulate diarrhea.  You can see in the attached image how one of my normal pizzas comes out...with normal mushrooms.<br /><br />So I'm highly disappointed...and it's left me feeling unsure of any Giorgio mushroom cans...and unsure about any organic mushroom cans...and just about canned mushrooms in general.  I like to use fresh when I have them (like. as I write this)...but most of the time when I make a pizza I use canned shrooms.  But I feel deeply scarred by this turd-infused experience and may have trouble trusting any canned mushrooms for a while.  Which is definitely going to cramp my style pizza-wise.  LAME!<br /><br />(In case anyone is wondering. this is not a joke. even if it may be funny to laugh at my stinky mushroom ordeal.  I lived it and I have the battle scars to prove it.)
13293,B003H26J5I,AXJ1QYBUL86ON,HarpswellWoman HarpswellWoman,2/2,1304121600,Good for Asian-style food. but pricey per serving,I bought 3 pasta shape varieties of these 8 oz. 2-serving bags of noodles in liquid in the refrigerated tofu section of our local grocery store for $1.99 per bag yesterday.  I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states perishable - keep refrigerated.  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles. and they did have a rather strange. strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while. stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce. garlic powder. powdered ginger. a small amount rice vinegar. water. 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.<br /><br />I served this side dish with broiled tuna. mahi mahi. and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br />I wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving. but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people. and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key. but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!<br /><br />Update:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles. rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise. they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta. but otherwise. they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag! And next to no carbohydrates!
13295,B003H26J5I,A79WEDY44P50Z,raquelnoel,1/1,1340150400,Surprisingly noodle like,I really like these little noodles. I am on the Dukan diet and I really miss pasta. so I thought I'd give the tofu noodles a try. I followed the directions on the package to rinse thoroughly. drain. and then heat for a minute or so in the microwave to dry them out. I used a couple of very short sprays of oil and stir fried them with fresh garlic. canned chopped tomatoes. red pepper flakes. and then added some scallions and cilantro at the end. Very delicious and hit the spot for my pasta craving! I will definitely purchase again!
13298,B003H26J5I,A3RXC1WYUGEQ1T,Mary Jersey Shore,1/1,1325462400,GREAT!!!,I love the Tofu Shirataki noodles (angel hair. spaghetti & fettucini). I eat 2 bags most days. Very filling and only 40 calories. I am not much of a cook. I prefer the simplest of methods to cook. I rinse off quickly in cool water. then throw on a non-stick frying pan. I used to use Olive Oil but have found I don't need that. either. I sprinkle with Mrs. Dash or Vogue vegetarian chicken base. Just stir for a couple of minutes to get some of the water out. It's great. Last night I brought an unopened bag to a Cajun restaurant with me. and they agreed to cook with it in place of the traditional pasta that was supposed to come with my meal. The owner was surprised how much it tasted like pasta. For breakfast I sometimes use a little Almond Milk and Stevia for sweetener. I think they taste GREATTTTT. very very similar to pasta (unlike the shirataki without the tofu that isn't refrigerated and is more gel-like and not as similar to pasta). The product is great for your digestion and fills you up. I often stir-fry one and put into a plastic container with cooked vegetables and reheat for lunch. I'm addicted to House Foods Tofu Shirataki. However. if possible. search at your local grocery stores. The shipping online is expensive because it needs to be refrigerated. Highly recommend!!
13303,B003H26J5I,A2RH5970FA8I2R,Twincar,0/0,1329177600,Closest thing to pasta yet,I heard about these through Hungry-girl.com and am so glad I tried them.  I kept hearing how I should replace pasta with spaghetti squash and found the texture and taste to be unsatisfying.  Although these need to be rinsed well and patted thoroughly dry. I think these are the closest thing to real pasta at about 10% of the calories.  I have tried the fettuccine and the macaroni. both which I like. but the angel hair shape is the best.  Works great with the Hungry-girl recipe on the back too.  YUM!  I highly recommend.  The seller also sent these to me so quickly and at no additional shipping price for my multiple orders.
13306,B003H26J5I,A2RC1YECN8IJWV,Deb W,2/4,1320537600,Horrible. rubbery. not at all like noodles,These look like noodles. but after that there is no comparing this product to pasta.  The texture is rubbery and there is no flavor.  If you love pasta. you will not love this product.
13312,B004BCV53O,A1SZOCZ9ETK9IM,Robert L. Cuda,2/4,1331683200,Gross,Blah!  My baby didn't like it. then I tasted it and it was awful.  It is NOTHING like what you might expect.  It's like bland goop with a faint hint of unseasoned over-boiled chicken.  What. is the theory that we should give our babies nasty food simply to take advantage of the fact that they have nothing to compare it to?  I didn't even feed it to my dog.
13329,B001BSBFUO,AA48HBDJNF97K,Cenintage's wife,2/2,1307664000,Great and helpful product!,We've been using Greenies Pill Pockets for a couple of years with all our pets (dogs and cats). They are great! They are often much larger than the tabs and capsules. so we frequently only use 1/3 or 1/2 of each pill pocket per dose. That works out even better because we get more pill pockets for our money!  I have even put more than one pill in the pocket. with no issues from the pets.
13339,B001BSBFUO,AFXI2NM2F6443,Tired Mom,1/1,1279584000,Only way to give a dog a pill,My dog loves these. It is the only way to give a pill to dogs. no fight. no mess and dog gets the full dose of pill because he thinks he is getting a treat.
13362,B001BSBFUO,A1P57BHDJMJC25,rose,0/0,1333238400,spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down...,Our dog has the ability to find and spit out the pill despite our hiding them in favorite foods. Greenies Pill Pockets have solved the problem.
13369,B001BSBFUO,A10JJSNCFX3MW1,Jessica Ila,0/0,1326931200,Works like a charm!,My dog. Spike. had a skin infection requiring taking 2 antibiotic capsules twice daily for just over a month. and the antibiotic had such a strong smell that I'd want to run away too when opening the bottle.  I've always snubbed Pill Pockets because of the expense - it was cheaper to bury medicines in pieces of hot dog. cheese. or bread or even burying it in peanut butter.  Stubborn Spike managed to figure all of these out though due to the strong scent of the medicine. and it made medicating him a nightmare.  As a last resort. I ordered Pill Pockets to give them a whirl.<br /><br />These really do make giving Spike his medicine so much easier!  In a week. he never turned his nose up or spit out medicine. and that means a lot less stress for this puppy mom.  Another reviewer said this and I figured I'd reiterate - they're a lot like chicken (or other meat. depending on your flavor) putty that's pre-shaped for capsules.  Spike's capsules (at 500mg each) were a little big for these pockets. but it was easy to shape around.  I know I'll be using these again rather than any other methods I've tried before.
13374,B001BSBFUO,AM76TKHVICZC6,Gertrud Kahler,0/0,1322524800,My dog says. YAY&lt; Pill time!,My dog used to work the pills out of cheese. peanut butter. meat cubes. broccoli (yess. she loves this stuff). and anything else I thought of to hide the darn things in. Then I tried these. She loves them. She practically swallows them without chewing. so no time to find the hidden pill. She likes both the chicken and the beef flavors equally.<br />Thanks Pill Pockets for making administering the daily pills to my geriatric Cushings dog so easy!
13387,B001BSBFUO,A2YD0OAK287ZG4,rmonta1,0/0,1311897600,Great.. makes giving meds so EASY,I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!
13394,B001BSBFUO,A17IIS0PQXP257,Texas Gurl TexasGurl,0/0,1264896000,Neat idea for pet meds,This product makes medicine dosing oh so easy.  Our big ol' chocolate Lab would sell her soul for a Greenies Pill Pocket.
13437,B002MXSAD2,A3SQOJ8SNPP0ET,1st Time Mom,3/3,1294790400,LOVE THIS PRODUCT!,We have 6 of these trays in various colors.  My husband and I both work and make our daughter's baby food instead of buying jars.  We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer. have a lid (which a lot of other baby food trays don't have). and the frozen portions pop out easily.  Another reviewer wrote they use it as a serving tray for baby instead of many bowls--I will most certainly try that when baby is ready to feed herself.<br /><br />As a tip...the lid isn't completely airtight (as other mentioned) so I wouldn't recommend leaving the food in the tray until you're ready to serve.  We pop food portions out after freezing over night and store in labeled bags.  This is very handy for grabbing foods quickly.
13439,B002MXSAD2,AJP3WM478YGWB,jacksmum,12/16,1291334400,Total waste of money,I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets. but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray. which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray. it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer. and it makes 2 ounce servings. which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces. but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors. or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy. I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too. that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay. it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute...
13440,B002MXSAD2,AJTFFGE5K339W,nzluna,2/2,1282953600,great ice cubes for baby food,I bought one of each color. blue. orange and green. I love this cubes. They are 2.5 oz. perfect portions for my baby. Now that he's eating more. for example at lunch. I thaw 2 cubes for his entree (salty) and one for desert (fruit). Once the cubes are frozen it is very easy to pop them out and store them in a zip-lock bag. they are also very easy o clean. I highly recommend this product.
13442,B002MXSAD2,A3JJ4665ML39NT,Grant T. Thimsen New Mom,2/2,1273017600,Great for homemade baby food,I have used this a couple times when making my own baby food and I love it.  It's really easy to freeze food in.  When the baby food is frozen you just run hot water on the back and pop out the food.  It washes up nicely in the dishwasher.  I think the ammount of food that it holds is good too.  I would highly recommend this product.
13444,B002MXSAD2,A1FZGVS6LOOZ17,AR,1/1,1314835200,One of my favorite baby products,The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is one of our favorite baby products.  We use a steamer and a food processor to make baby food.  We put the food in one of these freezer trays. freeze for a couple of hours. and then pop the food out and store it in the freezer in Ziplock bags. labeled with the type of food and the date.<br /><br />I saw a previous comment that the serving sizes were too large.  Um. no they are not.  If you want less - don't fill the cup all the way.  Crazy how that works!  I fill the cups to the top. and my son eats almost the entire serving.  I am glad that the cups are as big as they are.<br /><br />Clean up is a breeze - we don't put it in the dishwasher. we just run it under hot water.<br /><br />To prepare the frozen cubes. I pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds - then stir.  Another 15 seconds. and another stir.  Sometimes. another 10 seconds if I want to serve it warm.<br /><br />Great product for those who want to make cooking their own baby food even easier.
13478,B002MXSAD2,A50FYNAOYJCGX,Moo,0/0,1320451200,Easy to use and versatile,This freezer tray has nice proportions.  I bought it for a friend who uses it for her food and the baby's.  She thinks it's easy to use and clean and uses it for various foods and juice pops.
13481,B002MXSAD2,A24MJ3KLA26QWQ,Mary Estevez,0/0,1313020800,I Love These Trays!!!!!!!,I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays. but my 8 month old baby is eating two servings for lunch and dinner. so I ordered two more trays.  Not only are they colorful and fun. but so easy to clean and the frozen baby food pops right out after running the tray under warm water for a few seconds.  Although these trays are kind of expensive. they are totally worth the money if you only feed your baby homemade food.  I wish that these trays would have been on the market back when my son was a baby. as I had the entire door of my freeze full of small tupperwear with baby food and these trays would have made my life easier back then.  By the way. if you want to save more space in your freezer. you can just pop the baby food out of the trays and store in a freezer bag.  I absolutely love them and I highly recommend this product.
13492,B002MXSAD2,A3PZ1KRK2H3SNS,jnp720,0/0,1277683200,Easy to use,This is by far the easiest way I've found to freeze baby food and get it out again. The getting it out again is key - it can be really hard to get frozen puree out of ice cube trays without cracking the tray. It's also dishwasher safe. The only drawback is that it doesn't prevent freezer burn so if that's a concern for you. you'll need to put it inside of a freezer bag.
13509,B0001W2W62,AQYD2PV8IHB7V,Susan Brodlie pnut,10/11,1194998400,this sprouting mix is yummy!,the mix came quickly and was very sproutable.  i have lots of seeds to sprout for a long while.  it's great.
13515,B0001W2W62,A1FLQC4ORB5LI,lovefreejewelry florajt,3/3,1283817600,Yummy!,These sprouts tasted great together and my family loves them too! We put it on our salad and sandwiches.
13517,B0001W2W62,A17771LTRWSKQ5,Helen S. Lam,2/2,1331078400,Great mix,The seeds came in a plastic bag with a baggie tie.  About 90% of the seeds germinated.  This mix is a bit spicy if eaten alone.  However. it tastes great when eaten with other vegetables or in a sandwich.  One of my new favorite ways to eat these sprouts is add a spoonful of hummus to the sprouts.  It adds flavor and cuts the spiciness of the sprouts.  Give it a try!  I top my salads with these sprouts as well.<br /><br />I used 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout.  My house is coolish in the winter (55F - 65F) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house.  If you need to make it even warmer. turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat!  NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter!<br /><br />Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:<br /><br />1.  Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix. put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out.  Put the inner cut into the outer cup.  Soak 2 - 3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours.  Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration.  Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed.  Otherwise. leave it on the kitchen counter.  (You do not need light for sprouting.)<br /><br />2.  Pull out the inner cup (with the slits) to drain out the water. Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a shower and allow the water to drain out completely.  Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water.  Put the inner cup back into the outer cup (solid cup without slits).  Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.<br /><br />3. Repeat 2 every 12 hours for about 4-5 days.  It's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.<br /><br />5. On the last day. you can also put your sprouter near in indirect light to get some greening of the leaves.  It's not necessary but it sure is pretty to see the little green leaves on the sprouts.<br /><br />6. To store your sprouts. just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid.  It'll keep for about a week or so.<br /><br />For videos and recipes. check out SproutPeople.

I find that they toast better. taste better. and I feel less guilty after I eat two. Win. Win. Win. I will mention this for some of those sillies out there:  Don't think this counts as your daily serving of fruit. Yes. it does say made with real fruit however. it is so miniscule that it doesn't count. Sorry.

To have the ability to enjoy my decaffeinated tea with the convenience of my Keurig is one of life's greatest pleasures.  Each cup is fresh with all the Bergamot I enjoy from a full brew.

To be honest decaf tea is rarely satisfying. and this is the best of the options available.  Sorry Twinings. I love you I really do. its not you its me...decaf is not my cup of tea.

Glutenfreeda's gluten free granola!  The individual serving pouches are handy for snacks on the go. and assist in those moments when one might wish to overindulge in this decadent-tasting. yet extraordinarily healthful cereal.  Generously interspersed with the delicious oats are yummy toasted nuts and perfectly dried fruits.  The only regret I have about this product is when I'm down to my last packet. which is why I'll purchase it from Amazon by the case-full.  You'd better hurry and order yours. too. because I might just hoard it all for myself!
13665,B0032K3OI0,A1A87C7E8W4W66,Leonard Mayer Instructor,0/0,1350345600,Great for Weight Loss,I cook this product in soy milk. I add one packet in 1/2 cup of soy milk. It cooks in about 3 minutes. It tastes wonderful. It makes you feel full. It is low in calories. Everytime I feel hungry and I do not want to spoil my diet. I eat a bowl of Glutenfrieda granola. It promotes you being a vegetarian and losing weight. I recommend it highly.
13697,B0018CK2Y8,A20IA4HD66N2TD,jerryp,0/0,1287273600,doesn't last very long,As the initial reviewer stated. the biggest issue with this product is its durability. or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So. almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.
13698,B0018CK2Y8,AENGQJKTGYW93,M. Hornish,0/1,1328227200,Not recommended,I do NOT recommend these.  My six month old Golden Retriever. who is not a strong chewer. devoured this in less than five minutes.  It is a very expensive treat and I'm just hoping we don't have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the Edible Nylabone.  I will never buy these again!!!
13699,B002CZHWXE,A3CZXZMWHURZVF,Sophie Oakes,0/0,1331424000,Good for limited diets,My dogs had to be on food with limited ingredients for a while and this was the best of the types I tried. The dogs ate it easily (although without great gusto) and it helped us get through the medical issues that precipitated our use of it.  Vet recommended. I wouldn't use for day to day dog food. since other flavors without  limited ingredients appeal to the dogs more.
13709,B00513J4D0,A3P5T6X3X1HCPI,Stacey Lerner,0/1,1334188800,Cat Hated It!!,My cat looked at it. smelled it for a minute or so. took one bite and ran away.  She would not touch it after that.  We donated the rest of the shipment to a shelter.  Hopefully some cats there will like it.  The only thing I can get my cat to eat is Fancy Feast.  I have tried all the organic and grain free brands and she won't touch any of them.  She is an indoor/outdoor cat that we adoted as a one year old who was stray.  I think the only meat she likes besides fancy feast is fresh kill.  If you know some healthy brands that your fussy cat has enjoyed. please write a review or email me if that is an option.
13716,B003F8XZSS,AC1LSUQ96RZP6,Kristen R Pillans,0/0,1286841600,Great tea!,I'm not a huge fan of flavored tea. but the Raspberry Black Tea K-cups are great! My Keurig machine has an iced-tea option. so maybe that is why I am satisfied with my brew each time. I can also use 1 K-cup twice. The second one is weaker. of course. but it's still has a great flavor.
13722,B000AY9U20,A38YC9GHJBN2TV,Trading Pages,1/1,1276214400,One of the best tasting packaged cookies out there,I usually hate the taste of prepackaged cookies but these were amazingly yummy. I got the chocolate lovers cookies and they were LOADED with chocolate chips and chunks. In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.<br /><br />The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.

13812,B000UODYHW,A5E9PDZJWG5N4,D. Fruh,1/2,1289260800,Great tea. horrible packaging,The only reason for the 3 stars was the packets the individual teas were in.  I love this tea. I have the ones in the tin on auto delivery.  I was taking a trip. and ordered these so I could take some with me on my trip.  Prior to leaving home I took some out of the box and put them in my suitcase.  I got to the hotel and tried to open the little packages.  Impossible to open the individual packages.  No knife with me. I ended up using a toe nail clipper to open the individual packages of each tea.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just a problem with the first box. but I would not recommend buying this tea in the boxes. go for the cannisters.  If you do buy the boxes have something near by to open each and every packet of tea.

Not minty!,1) Does not have that harsh tic-tac minty sensation that numbs your mouth.<br />2) The red ones taste like cherries.<br />3) The yellow ones taste like passion fruit.<br /><br />This product freshens a person's breath and is very pleasant to suck on. And they taste so good it is easy to finish a pack of them without realizing it. So it makes sense to buy a box of 12. This lasts me about 1-2 months. Your mileage may vary!

13852,B002O5QWD8,AQIXBD5MNMPO8,B.,2/3,1295395200,Horrendous!,After wasting many batches of these nuggets I finally got them to puff up properly and was excited to try some that were not still rock hard.<br />What I found was that the texture is not very appealing and they smell horrific. I know most pork rinds smell funny but these were extremely pungent and the after taste was even worse.<br /><br />I ended up just throwing away the whole bag because I was not interested in ever having that taste in my mouth again.<br /><br />Great idea. Was excited to try..  but these just fell way short.
13860,B002O5QWD8,AU7XEEMQ13NPE,judy,0/0,1332633600,Not worth it,These don't taste any better to me than pork rinds I can buy at the store in a bag. and they are WAYYYYYY more trouble to make. A large number of them won't puff up for me at all no mater how long I cook them. either. Maybe my microwave is underpowered. I dunno. but when even the puffed ones are not somehow tastier I just don't see the point. I feel like I really wasted my money on these.
13908,B002OFZIV0,A1IP04QSYWO4TW,JVAN Electronics Shopper,8/9,1227916800,If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...,UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing). but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now. instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky. when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing. being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken. then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter. crispy or chewy skin. and deep fried flavor components. then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite). I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag. and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight. it seems better to feed them a real liver treat. versus this product which is made with liver.<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG>Pro-Treat Beef Liver.

UGH!

They are rectangular but are scored so that you can break each treat into two squares if you prefer smaller treats.  These do not have the typical unappealing smell of most dog treats; they almost smell like a treat suitable for humans.  I like that they are not full of preservatives.<br />I have made my own dog treats in the past in order to avoid the preservatives and additives but they are a lot of trouble to make.

I gave a half to my 48 pound mutt and she spit it out at first not sure what to do with it.  She's used to the small peanut butter treats from Costco.  I encouraged her to eat it and she finally did.  She left quite a few crumbs along the way which eventually were eaten.  Obviously my dog liked the way the biscuits tasted but I like the neatness of smaller dog treats.  If you have a small dog. these wouldn't work unless you wanted to spend time breaking them into smaller chunks.  If you have a large dog and are looking for an organic alternative. try these.
14052,B0045XE32E,A2T7GJONIZFP1Q,Maudeen Wachsmith BeachReader,6/10,1300233600,Inedible for smaller dogs,I have always trusted the Newman's Own brand.  From popcorn to salad dressings. I have never been disappointed in one of their products.  Until now.  Each dog treat is scored to break it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2 X 1-1/4 inch and quite thick - about 1/2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products. but when my dogs don't care for them. it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so. and decided. for some reason. that they were inedible.  However. the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a treat. Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog. a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth. she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on Newman's Own brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again.

They have a ridge across the top so you can snap the biscuit in two. I cannot always get them to break. but I'm an older woman.<br />Both the Rottweiler and the Cocker Spaniel like them.  The cocker has the same problem I do. the hard texture.  But this is no problem for the larger dog.<br />My experience with the Newman's Own brands has always been positive.  And this really is a product from New Zealand.<br />Here's the ingredients list:<br />organic barley. organic lamb. organic carrots. organic apples. palm oil. organic molasses.<br /><br />I would consider buying them. but only for larger dogs or ones with strong jaws.

Wholesome Dog Treat.,Bottom Line Up Top:  While individual tastes may vary. this healthy and humanely produced dog food is a real treat that bot you can your dog will feel good about; you in your head and heart. the dog in a very happy tummy.<br /><br />This is one cookie (Newman's great line in The Young Philadelphians) that was a HUGE hit with our 14-year old Golden Retriever. Sadie. The Wonder Dog. After some circumspect sniffing and tentative gnawing. Sadie got into these in a major way.  Yes. they're crunchy. but Sadie had no trouble chewing it up and gave us the patented Retriever Look signaling she wanted MORE.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />The treats are about 1 by 2 and are scored so that they can be broken in half.  THe ingredient list reads like something you'd find at a California health food retreat (well. except fo rthe meat):<br /><br />Organic barley. Organic lamb. Organic carrots. Organic apples. Organic palm oil. Organic molasses.<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that Sadie is not very particular when it comes to food. Not at all. Oranges. cherry plums. lettuce. bok choy. and tofu(!) are cherished by her; she holds the bok choy with both paws as if it were a bone. She's not totally easy (she refuses to eat spinach--probably some early puppy experience). but calling her the goat of Goldens would not be a cheap shot.<br /><br />However. it's important that Sadie stay away from typical canine snacks. especially at her age. She has arthritis. and a poor diet has been linked to a number of disorders in older dogs. Fortunately. our vet has warned us about this. and it's become necessary to tell a certian neighbor to stop feeding her raw hamburger. baked potatoes with sour cream. bacon. etc.<br /><br />Now. I don't want to guilt-trip anyone over what they're feeding their pooches. but here's a (partial) list of culinary BAD DOGS that you won't find in Newman's pet foods. (The following--and MORE--can be found at [...]. WARNING: The following contains graphic descriptions of typical dog food ingredients.  HIDE YOUR CHILDREN.<br /><br />NO Poultry by-products - Ground. rendered. cleaned slaughtered poultry carcass parts such as necks. feet. lymph nodes. undeveloped eggs and intestines (and a small amount of feathers). The quality is very inconsistent between batches. Note: By product meals are often derived from 4-D meat sources - defined as food animals that have been rejected for human consumption because they were presented to the meat packing plant as Dead. Dying. Disabled or Diseased.<br /><br />NO Chemical fertilizers - Chemical fertilizers have been incriminated in serious health problems in animals and are not allowed in organic-certified products.<br /><br />NO Antibiotics or steroids - Long-term daily administration may result in a compromised immune system. muscle wasting. and destruction of the friendly bacteria living in the intestines that aid the digestion of food and assimilation of nutrients.<br /><br />NO Chemical additives or artificial preservatives - Chemical antioxidants. such as ethoxyquin. BHT or BHA. that were designed to extend the shelf life and reduce fat spoilage (rancidity) of pet foods may cause allergic reactions and affect liver and kidney functions.<br /><br />NO Artificial Colors and Dyes - Coloring agents provide an artificial rich and meaty look to modify the appearance of highly processed foods and make them more appealing to pet owners.<br /><br />As if this weren't enough. 100's of thousand of dollars are donated by the Newman Foundation to animal advocates (lest you think this means radical animal activists. we're talking mainstream things like animal shelters. etc. Details available at the website above).<br /><br />Sadie says. Give it a try!
14106,B0045XE32E,A2SZLNSI5KOQJT,"Carrie, Formerly &34;Sister Carrie&34;",0/1,1298678400,Tail Wagging Treats!,My four mixed breed dogs (40lbs-100lbs)gobble up Newman's Own dog treats.  But. these terrific dogs gobble up just about anything (except fresh green leafy vegetables). so perhaps their standards shouldn't be the mark of goodness.<br /><br />I'm an ingredient list reader for all foods (human & animal). so that is what I did when I received the Newman's pet treats.  The ingredient list is short & consists of the following:<br /><br />Organic Barley. Organic Lamb. Organic Carrots. Organic Apples. Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois. a Source of Vitamin E). Organic Molasses<br /><br />The treats themselves are rectangular & scored in the middle.  They are 2 x 1-/4 for the full size & 1 x 1-1/4 for the 1/2 size.  They do not have a strong smell. but a hint of apple is noticeable (& a grain smell. which I presume is the barley).  My 10oz bag came with 18 full size treats.<br /><br />I like the rectangular shape of the treat.  Sometimes my large dogs get excited about treats & forget about nicely.  With the rectangular shape. my hands won't fall victim to an enthusiastic chomp.  Since the treats are scored down the middle. I can break them down. so my older. smaller dogs can easily eat the treat.<br /><br />Overall. I think the ingredients are excellent for a dog treat. and it is nice that they are adaptable for different sized dogs.
14109,B0045XE32E,A1S2IY37JU93XS,W. E. Phillips,0/1,1298592000,Dogs love them!,I have two dogs-a Welsh Corgi and a medium sized mixed breed. and they both LOVE these treats! They smell good and are sturdy-not crumbly. The only thing I would change is to make them a little smaller. as I try to help my dogs watch their weight!
14112,B0045XE32E,AW8I32KIU8SG1,Michelle Mathiot Life is an Art,0/1,1298592000,YUMMY! I Loved'em,Well. I didn't actually eat one. but my faithful Golden Retriever did. The thing with dogs is. they eat pretty indiscriminately. How do I know this dog biscuit is any better than any other dog biscuit? He eats them all! Open the bag and smell. Most dog treats smell horrendous. I was very surprised at the non-offensive odor of these. Yes. the idea of organic all healthy treats appeals to me too. But mainly. they won't stink up my car if I take them with me someplace. They are a nice size for bigger dogs. but have scores on them so you can break them up to smaller sizes. Nice packaging too. with a zipper top. I like that much better than a box that comes open constantly. We give'em five woofs!
14129,B0045XE32E,A52X1I4UT56KL,J. Hoelscher debater7,1/3,1300320000,My dog loved them.,I'm not sure what makes these new Zealand style. but my dog loved them. Each 10oz pack has 6 good sized treats. They're seemingly hard as rock but my dog. a fairly large 6 month old mutt. loved them.  He just crunched away for about 10 minutes on each one. He definitely preferred them to Milkbone and his breath was better. I don't know that they would be suitable for a puppy without all his adult teeth. but mine was fine.
14146,B0045XE32E,A3HPCRD9RX351S,Spudman,1/3,1299024000,Hardtack Dog Treats,We have two small dogs with two small mouths. so when I opened up the bag of Newman's Own Organics New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats Lamb and Barley Recipe I was taken aback by the size of these biscuit treats. The one inch square bricks are joined together in pairs - pairs than can be separated by hand at the indentation in the middle. Trying to make furthur manual divisions is fruitless unless one is a pro wrestler or football player. The treats are also too big. I thought. for our two dogs. Now what?<br /><br />Using the serrated edge of a metal ice cream scoop I was able to break the biscuits into manageable pieces. After some intial sniffing and backing away Gabby and Piper took their first tastes and seemed to like the new treat. On subsequent days they've taken to them more and more eagerly. Just to see what would happen. I gave a whole biscuit to Gabby the Bolognese. She coccooned in her doggy bed and ate the whole treat leaving a few crumbs behind but not as many as expected. The next couple days I gave her whole biscuits again. These biscuits were carried about the house all day and hidden in secret places like on the middle of our bed. on the sofa. and on  the stairs leading to the upper level. She hasn't tried to bite into a whole biscuit after the first and only time.<br /><br />Piper the shih tzu just can't handle these biscuits because of their size and hardness. As long as she seems to enjoy eating them. I don't mind using the ice cream scoop to break the Newman treats for her.<br /><br />I like the recipe ingredients used to make the lamb and barley treats and the absence of fillers and artificial chemicals used in many supermarket treats. The organic aura is also a plus.<br /><br />Based on our experience I think these wholesome treats are best for larger dogs who have the teeth and jaw power to tackle and enjoy such hard biscuits. The Neman's Own line of dog products is excellent. but for our pooches something smaller would serve our needs better.
14162,B0045XE32E,AV1F8VNJPLPTL,S. Smerud,0/2,1299369600,A hard biscuit with crumbs. enjoyed by a beagle,I set down one of the Newman's Own treats next to a strip of Science Diet jerky and let my beagle choose.  He first sniffed the Newman's Own. then ate the jerky. then came back for the Newman's Own.<br /><br />The Newman's Own treats are dry hard biscuits. but my beagle had no problem eating them.  They do create a lot of crumbs. so be ready if your dog wouldn't eat the crumbs also.<br /><br />Though second place. Newman's Own is probably a healthier treat.  Either way. they were enjoyed.
14164,B0045XE32E,A1FWFCJU2G7TRA,KDMask,0/2,1299196800,Even My Picky Dog Loves 'Em!,These are thick. hearty treats that come in squares of two you can break apart. They smell like graham crackers!! My dog is very picky and really loves these snacks. He also has very sensitive skin and so far so good with that. No hot spots or anything. His food is an organic duck/rice mix with no fillers. The ingredients on these treats are simple as well.  I will be buying these again!
14167,B0045XE32E,APP5MBH2BSX6I,Brian Hulett okierazorbacker2,0/2,1299110400,Elvis likes it better than peanut butter & banana sandwiches!,Our retriever. Elvis. tried to open the package himself.  After a little assistance from opposable thumbs. he stuck his snout into the bag and retrieved one.  It didn't last long.<br /><br />This is indeed an all-organic product. according to the label. and this company has enough integrity that it's not in doubt.  Barley. lamb. carrots. apples. palm oil. and molasses. all listed as certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  Low fat (4%). crunchy. about the size and shape of a Fig Newton.<br /><br />I used to joke about organic foods.  Having read up on the subject. I find that it's verifiably (not just anecdotally) healthier for humans to avoid preservatives and other artificial additives.  Natural foods are more easily and fully digested. and don't tax the system as much as the cheaper products with long lists of additives.  It stands to reason your dog's system is the same.<br /><br />Elvis will have a hunk o' hunk o' organic Newman treats. please.  While he WILL eat anything but okra (no joke). he's not always this enthusiastic about it.  Mr. Newman. keep up the good work.
14184,B0045XE32E,A2AAHDM93LC9BI,groomRN Erik,1/4,1299974400,The dogs love these treats!,We gave these out to grooming customers. and the reports we got back were that the dogs loved them.  They're all natural. so I felt comfortable giving them out.
14205,B0045XE32E,A1DO6DKWF3CMBD,Big Daddy,2/3,1299456000,My doggie is not a huge fan,My mountain feist (a breed that is similar to a Jack Russell). an admittedly finicky eater. is no big fan of them. He will only eat the treats if they are mixed with canned dog food.  While it is good that the treats will be eaten and will not be wasted. mixing it with food seems to defeat the purpose of a treat.<br /><br />They are made of great ingredients and not made in China. which is a great thing if you are concerned about some of the junk that has been put into dog food as filler ingredients. I give it three stars because. despite my finicky dog's lack of a desire to snatch them from my hand. the treats smell good and this appears to be a trustworthy and relatively healthy offering.
14207,B0045XE32E,A1H88L8X6HM1BQ,CJ-MO,2/3,1299024000,Healthy. organic ingredients...but mixed review on flavor,These lamb and barley treats have some excellent features. I was impressed the certified organic ingredients. the re-sealable bag. and I like that they are large bones. but are scored so they can be broken in half. Left whole. the treats are good for large dogs. but when broken in half would be good for medium-sized dogs. They seem a bit too hard for small dogs.<br /><br />Our dogs usually like lamb flavored food. so this seemed like a good choice. We have three dogs and each had their own reaction to the treat. Our smallest dog. who usually likes anything. would barely sniff the treat and didn't even try to eat it. The middle-sized dog who is more picky wouldn't eat it at first. After playing with it for a few minutes. he finally did eat it. I'm assuming the smell wasn't appealing to him since it doesn't smell like a typical dog treat. Our dogs are used to a variety of store-bought and homemade dog treats. However. these organic treats smelled like hay to me (I'm assuming that's the barley). and therefore weren't very well received by two of my dogs.<br /><br />Our Golden Retriever likes most any treats and she ate this one without hesitation. While the treats might be great for some. since only one of our dogs will eat the treats regularly. I don't think they would be worth the extra cost for our household.
14268,B0045XE32E,A34C98SJU4M7DD,PhAzEr DaZeR,0/0,1298937600,My Chihuahua Couldnt Eat But A Doberman Loved Them!,I have a Chihuahua that eats anything and everything- even things that are not supposed to be eaten.<br />When these treats came. she wanted them. she could smell them when the bag opened and was going crazy for them. I gave her a biscuit and she played with it for a couple minutes and tried to eat it but she couldnt- was too big and too hard. I could NOT break it into a smaller piece by hand. they are extremely hard. I left the treat out overnight and she left it alone. A friend brought their Doberman over and she ate the treat no problem.<br />I am rating these treats a 3 because my small dog couldnt eat them and there was no sizing info about the treat on the package and really if it wasnt for a friend having a dog the treats wouldve been trashed.
14270,B0045XE32E,AQFORCKKB6F8I,Rough Customer,0/0,1298937600,Hard biscuits. very good smelling. big dogs love 'em,Got these for our two large (50 and 100 lb) dogs. who love them.  The biscuits seem hard. they do snap in half easily for sharing with the dogs (one for each) and the smell of the biscuits. we agree smells to me like ginger snaps.  Maybe there is ginger in them. don't know.  Our two big dogs love them. and they are given only as treats maybe once or twice a day. Recommended!  Minus one star for being really hard.
14274,B0045XE32E,A2Z3IXZ17E88J4,James Tepper &34;Are we there yet&34;,0/0,1298937600,Lucky says yumm!,This was my first time ordering something from the Vine that I could not really review myself.  And our dog. Lucky. can't speak...English.  I do. however. understand a little Dog speak.  When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats. he snarfed it down just as expected. just as he does with all treats.  But the next day. as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat. he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.<br /><br />JMT
14277,B000Z94AGQ,ARAK6UE964E60,Melissa D. Ransom,0/0,1140912000,Like Chai. only better,This tea has been a favorite in my family for years. It's difficult to find locally. so I was so happy to find it at the Vitamin Shoppe and at such a great price. It's a spicy tea. great with toast or crackers or just by itself.  If you like Chai. you'll love this bolder version.
14285,B001F8ITLI,ANH456X1BLD6B,Ellis Moose,13/13,1296432000,Good value for what it is,My wife and I wanted to get a gift basket like this for her father for Christmas.  We weren't going to be able to visit in person this year and enjoy Christmas morning breakfast and thought a gift basket would be nice.  After researching tons of options I became frustrated that so often the shipping on products like this cost more than the actual products themselves.  Let's face it. a pre-arranged gift basket of food is rarely going to be a value.  But when you add in shipping these things can be down right outrageous.  We came across this basket and it was available with Amazon Prime free shipping.  Not only that. it was less expensive than other alternatives we were looking at (some from other non-Amazon vendors).  We went ahead and ordered this.  It arrived exactly on time in excellent condition and. according to my father-in-law. it was excellent.  I have no complaints and was happy to find this option.  I was pleased with the company and Amazon.  Hopefully it remains prime-eligible in the future.
14288,B0014GP4NW,A18JJ2PH0PS1P5,Donna E. Gardner PEDRN,2/2,1302220800,Good old Chunky--missing candy bars!,I love Chunky candy bars-they remind me of being a kid and sharing them with my dad!  When this package arrived the outer card board box was sealed but the actual silver box of candy was not. The box was missing 3 candy bars not a big deal when you have ordered 24 except I now wonder  what other tampering could have been done.  I would go with a seller directly and not try to save by using Amazon Prime for this one!
14290,B00012OHZ6,A1JM0IBV4MQD9Q,Michael Haley,5/5,1305417600,Good Sushi Rice Ingredient,We got this to make homemade Sushi rice.  It does it's job flavoring the rice and you get quite a bit to a package.  Thankfully Amazon had this because our Asian supermarket didn't!
14299,B001CWV4PA,A2XL6TZM34HFV3,Review Man Review Man,1/3,1239235200,Bland,My son's celiac so we're very familiar with gluten free products.  I bought these because I trust the Glutino brand name but really. they're just not that great.  We tried them once and that was it because they're bland and tasteless.  There are better gluten free alternatives out there.
14307,B001CWV4PA,A3MZFG4EECNX7Y,J.B. John,6/6,1228003200,Great Crackers,These are great crackers. probably the closest you will find to wheat based crackers.  The crackers are really a 5. but I take one star off for shipping damage.  This is not necessarily Amazon's fault. as I doubt even if you lived down the street from the wherehouse they would arrive without damage.  My recent shippment arrived with moderate breakage. but the shipping box was clean (no damage). though the original container showed a little damage.  I would not order anything heavy to be included in an order with these crackers.
14318,B001CWV4PA,AFA5JCOP7D53A,T. Hyde,3/4,1244073600,Gluten Free Lunchable,My school age GF son loves these crackers. He says they taste the closest to the old crackers he used to be able to eat. We started making lunchables for him one day by adding a slice of lunch meat and cheese and he loved it. He now takes lunchables to school once or twice a week using these crackers.<br /><br />On their own these crackers aren't bad. but they tend to be better with a topping of some sort (as with most GF breads and crackers).<br /><br />My only complaint is the packaging. The crackers come in two foil pouches. Often times many of the crackers are broken. I'd love to see Glutino package the crackers in rolls like Ritz does.<br /><br />Overall. these are a staple in our pantry.
14331,B001CWV4PA,AQQRUNOEA310C,J. Brad Yeates ForeJacks,0/0,1336348800,Great GF crackers,These are some of the tastiest GF crackers. My 6 year old daughter loves them. They also look the most like non-GF crackers. which helps my daughter feel a little less self conscious when she takes them to school. Amazon sells them for a great price. Thanks Amazon!
14345,B001CWV4PA,ASPVZXF8XRM9J,bandonmary,0/0,1315440000,Great-tasting crackers,These crackers are the tastiest gluten-free crackers I have found. and I have been looking for 25 years.  They do break easy. though. so spreading anything firmer than peanut butter on them will often result in breakage.  Because of the great taste. I'm willing to overlook this flaw.
14358,B001CWV4PA,AU1XTEMM21J0W,amyb,0/0,1299283200,Great cracker for gluten allergic/sensitive people,These crackers are the best I've tried so far.  If I didn't have celiac's disease. I'd buy a non-gluten-free cracker. but am very pleased with the consistency (softer than others I've tasted) of this gluten free cracker and it doesn't have that peppery taste that most others have.  They're great in soup or with peanut butter or cheese as a snack.
14360,B001CWV4PA,AKGHZR2UV4LS5,polebear,0/0,1291766400,the best gluten free cracker!!!,I couldn't believe it the first time i tried Glutino crackers.  It actually tastes like a RITZ cracker.  No flaxseed or pine-nut flavors to overpower what you put on the cracker.  It's just a great cracker with just the right flavor for snacking!  I love this product!!!
14365,B001CWV4PA,A1ZNKWO2CCUYT8,Jane Wade,0/0,1282435200,The crackers are often broken.,Even in the stores. they tend to be broken. but these on average are worse. Given the price per cracker. that makes them really expensive.<br /><br />Love the crackers themselves. They are the best vehicle for peanut butter and jam that I've found.
14369,B001CWV4PA,A3UB8E6M4L898J,Vanessa Hughes,0/0,1278633600,Not worth the money,These are no good. I got them thinking they would be a great snack with cheese or meat or jelly...  My kid won't eat them at all and I don't blame him.  They have no flavor. and nothing seems to help. I wouldn't buy them again.
14371,B001CWV4PA,A2UR6DN0RMUWSI,ducksinarow,0/0,1275782400,great taste. closest thing to a real cracker. package is poor,These taste fine. like a fancy cracker rather than a saltine.  My only issue with them is the packaging.  They come in two bags inside the box. and many are cracker pieces.  I'll buy them again but I really wish the company would come up with a better packaging method. perhaps in cylinders like ritz crackers are packaged.
14382,B001CWV4PA,A1NKZ7A7T47413,Amazon Fan,0/0,1263772800,I've tried several different flavors and haven't like any of them.,Food is very much a personal preference but I really don't like any of these crackers made by this company. They taste like flavored paper. Someone said better than nothing but I'd rather have something else.
14384,B001CWV4PA,A1BV9BI7TWUJAB,T. Robbins,0/0,1261353600,Repulsive. actually tastes like liquid egg!,These were completely repulsive. After I tried one. I looked at the package ingredients. Liquid egg was listed as an ingredient. This explains alot. I don't eat eggs at all. so I imagine I was particularly sensitive to the flavor of egg in a cracker. but it seemed concentrated to me. I don't expect an eggy taste to a cracker. just buttery. It is strange that Glutino can sell pretzels that are better than the wheat based kind. and have these crackers taste so awful. I guess they work for some people. just really weren't for me.
14391,B001CWV4PA,A3MZMMX88G8BVG,D. Barletta dawnb,1/2,1244160000,best gfcf cracker on the market,These are the best tasting GFCF crackers on the market.  They do not fall apart. they are flavorful. and taste just like REAL CRACKERS  My son who is a picky eater LOVES them!!!
14408,B00063KO34,A1RC30R83C74IH,Bagpipes48,2/2,1253664000,Bad breath in dogs,Our Schnauzer has some really horrible breath and we don't know exactly why. I tried several of the dental dog chews testing to qualify their claims. All failed my test. I saw these at Wal-Mart and decided to give them a try. SUCCESS! Honestly. though. her mouth doesn't smell like a rose garden. but what an improvement. I don't feel like shooshing her away. We can play at close quarters now My only problem with W-M is they carry only small bags. So. I am going to buy at Amazon.com since I can get the large size bags.
14418,B00063KO34,A3LOCNXB7Z1WCH,Shelley Shelley,5/13,1261353600,Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.,You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews. and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings. we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog.
14432,B00284TR82,AXC6VQKPULUW8,K. Carter,0/0,1346630400,Great product!,Good price. great product and very convenient.  My daughter in college was running to the grocery every week to buy creamer and put it in her roommate's fridge.  Not anymore. She keeps these in a container near the coffee maker in her dorm.
14436,B00284TR82,A2FGK9G5R0VT0V,Charles Wright,0/0,1343779200,Arrived undamaged,I was a little hesitant to order due to the packaging concerns of others. but I did anyway.  They arrived today undamaged.  I had ordered some other items which were shipped together in a larger box. so that probably helped.  In other words the box the creamers were in was itself in a larger box.  I can see how a few might burst if they were roughly handled.  They are shipped loose in a box.  For the price though. I figured if a few burst I was still way ahead on price.  I give it 5 stars because you should already know about the product before you order (yummy!) and they were undamaged on this shipment.
14443,B00284TR82,A81ECNX5TJ4MW,K. Larsen,0/0,1335312000,Always Good,Got hooked on this when I was traveling the US. now I can't live without it. Packaging has improved. and everything arrived in one piece.
14473,B00284TR82,A2BYYZGYD8DCSK,Nikita,0/0,1282435200,Delicious addition to your morning coffee,Love these individual creamers for morning coffee! I'm not normally a coffee drinker (I think it's too bitter). and don't want to add too much sugar. so this is the perfect alternative to give it a creamy consistency and sweet flavor. Highly recommended for anyone who may be a first time coffee drinker who likes the taste of sweet french vanilla.
14477,B00284TR82,ATIEQTDVEVLRN,Gwen,0/0,1267920000,Okay Creamer and Okay Packaging...,I bought this brand of French Vanilla creamer because it was cheaper than my usual brand (Coffee Mate French Vanilla Single Serve Creamers) but. I don't think I'll buy these again unless there's a significant difference in price. In comparison to the Coffee Mate (in my opinion) the French Vanilla flavor feels more artificial and has a very slight aftertaste....nothing too bothersome though. Overall. it is still a good creamer. I just prefer the Coffee Mate version. However. for the hazelnut flavor. I do prefer the International Delight version over all everything else.<br />As for the packaging. like the other reviewers. there seemed to have been a leak in one of the cups and so a few of them were sticky and had a crust-like thing on them. But for me. it wasn't a big mess (it really did seem like just ONE cup leaked) and so it wasn't a big deal for me.

I love this stuff in anything from beverages to my instant oatmeal.  Try it and you will agree. And by signing up for scheduled delivery I am never without it in the house
14481,B00284TR82,A26NQ3NMW59CDM,T. Barnes,0/1,1267228800,Failed on delivery. AWESOME on customer service,I ordered the French Vanilla. the only creamer I ever like. Unfortunately. before my item was shipped. Amazon put the item under review and sent me Hazelnut. YUCK!  I was refunded the money. thankfully. but was told that I could reorder after the item was no longer being reviewed. As I spoke to the Amazon representative. I checked the item and saw that the price had increased. Amazon customer service took care of me and I was completely satisfied by the time I got off the phone. I got a refund for the item AND I'll be getting a replacement item once it becomes available.  THANK YOU AMAZON. Although this means I'll be stuck w/ more powered creamer or Starbucks until my creamer comes in.

I also have moderate stomach issues so thought I'd try this tea.  I will admit it took me a couple cups of tea to get hooked. but once I did I found the taste wonderful and the calming effect on my stomach is a big help.  I drink one cup every night after dinner.  If I'm away from home I bring some tea bags with me.
14489,B000CMD63E,A5WHW9VAQLK1V,Carolyn Andrews,7/7,1170892800,good for tummy upset,It works. Everybody at work comes and asks me for this tea when their stomach is upset or when they eat too much or have gas. Also it has a nice sweet taste. No sugar required.

Prices have gone up everywhere it seems and this pack offered on Amazon is once again the best price I could find.

I can reliably say this coffee is the best substitute for a Keurig based cafe au lait attempt. Aside from that. it is a tasty dark blend. you just have to look at Emeril each time. then jab him in the head with the K-cup assembly.
14571,B0032BXUJM,AMF910FPUEI7F,Lyle Cameron California Guy,0/0,1309046400,Great coffee & service,This is the best way to go for your Keurig Coffee Maker.  Amazon ever writes a week earlier reminding you they are shipping and asks you if you want to skip this shipment. go ahead with it. or ship one week earlier (just in case you're running out).  Great great service. Go for it.

Upon opening the box I saw coffee grinds meaning some kcups broke open.<br /><br />I made a quick call to amzn. Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.<br /><br />AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item'. they said to keep it or throw it away. but they couldnt take it back.<br /><br />Obviously I took the time to clean everything and kept the undamaged kcups.<br /><br />I recently tried EMERILS BIG EASY BOLD and like it very much. Tried around 8 cups to ensure the last was as good as the first.<br /><br />I wont put it at the top of my 'favorite kcups' list. but will say it was very tasty and worth ordering.<br /><br />Nice 'Parisian' taste. Decent kick.<br /><br />4 star coffee + 5 star AMZN CS = BUY IT. You and your guests should like it and AMZN CS ensures if there is an issue. they will make it right.

Its not overpriced; and will please most anyone you serve it to. I will be buying this again. pleased with this purchase.
14635,B0032BXUJM,A35QDS2JR8942J,Aaron Harvey,0/0,1338076800,Nothing but problems,Just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine.  Its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue.  Had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made.  They would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere!
14637,B0032BXUJM,A9DJ0G0UY3D2C,Tracy622,0/0,1337040000,pretty good coffee,This coffee is pretty good. One of the better Keurig coffees. I've tried many of them and a lot I find to be weak. This is more comparative to a brewed coffee.

My husband and I drink med/bold coffee and are pretty snobbish when it comes to coffee.  I have had better coffee than Emeril's but it's up there in the good coffee category.  I would definitely buy again for the cost that it was.

14686,B000DZKKK2,A3JI2PY1C37GN4,T. Rice,1/1,1175558400,AWESOME BROWNIE MIX!!!!!!!!!,This is my absolute favorite gluten free baking mix. You must add in the suggested extras to make the best brownies: 1/2 c sour cream. 1/2 c chocolate chips or chunks. Sometimes takes longer to bake also. so dont overbake. but worth the time/wait! Those who can eat gluten fight over these brownies with me! :-)
14694,B000DZKKK2,A3BSPXD2A2UQ2T,Simply Me,0/0,1350345600,Suprisingly GOOD,I initially purchased a package of this brownie mix from Walmart; it was on clearance. For years. I had no idea why I was always sick. One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently. I did not eat it. I was not sad. but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway. I made these brownies tonight. Since I like cake-like brownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor). I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1/2 cup of water. I used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 1/4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans. so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good brownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies. My brownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose-free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events. It won't even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until AFTER they've said how good they are. (smile)
14695,B000DZKKK2,A2W6NRPTHUBS4L,Mama Turtle,0/0,1347580800,Wow!,I've had some gluten free foods that were terrible. but this is not one of them! These are amazing. My 8 y/o daughter has recently been put on a gluten free diet by her doctor for gluten intolerance (testing for Celiac also) and she was upset that she couldn't have anything worth eating anymore. I made her these brownies. and she said they were better than my recipe (which was a wheat based brownie)! Along with food intolerances she has high-functioning autism so she is very picky about textures. gritty food bothers her. I noticed a tiny texture difference from the wheat brownies but she gobbled them up anyway. they were THAT good. I made the original style. and it came out moist. soft. and just gooey enough but not undercooked. I like them better than wheat brownies. because you can cut these while they're still somewhat hot and they don't crumble! Getting them out of the pan hot is a trick but I only broke one brownie doing it. Even my husband. who can have all the gluten he likes. loved them.
14710,B000DZKKK2,A133Z8M914CF7K,Robbyn S. Hahn,0/0,1238371200,LOVE from a brownie snob,Truly. I adore these brownies.  I am always reluctant to use mixes for anything but an extra crazy schedule forced me to grab this at the store. and boy howdy am I glad!  I made the butter version and added an extra Tablespoon of oil for extra moisture.  You know those flourless chocolate cakes that are so yummy?  That's what these remind me of.  I will be buying this again and again. and was so impressed that now I'm embarking on other Pamela products.
14712,B000DZKKK2,A3BMXVPSW75SJF,kari,0/0,1235174400,Wow - great!,My 3-yr old daughter just got diagnosed with Celiac's. We're experimenting now finding the right products to substitute what we like that taste the best. This is the best brownie mix! I like it better than Bob's Red Mill brownie mix (which I thought was good too. but a bit moist). It tastes just like regular brownie mix. No complaints. everyone loves it. and my daughter doesn't have a tummy ache. Perfect!
14721,B000DZKKK2,A2Q6HOOMIJPYQ,Susan L. Marcinko,0/0,1180483200,Awesome brownies!,These gluten-free brownies match up with Ghiardhelli's Triple Chunk Brownie Mix.  I add chocolate chips to give them a little twist.  My whole family enjoys these.  This is the best gluten-free dessert I've found.
14732,B003UDQ5V2,A1UO52VYKA7LN,sueinNY,1/1,1291593600,Helped with allergies,I switched to this food to try and eliminate food allergies.  After spending hundreds of dollars at the vet for my dog who wouldn't stop licking his paws raw.  Within 3 weeks he stopped licking and his hair stopped falling out.  I also mixed this dry food with EVO 95% venison in a can. I took about a week to slowly switch over to the new food. So now his only protein was venison and all grain free. The food is expenspensive but cheaper than weekly vet visits and giving him steroids/sprays/baths.  Make sure you don't give your dog anything else like rawhides. treats or table food.
14749,B004SVLHOU,A27RR0NCKJ1XLU,Maxx,0/0,1312588800,inconsistant flavor,Package arrived on time and in one piece. but after eating some I noticed the flavor of some is stronger than in others.  About 1 in 5 has no flavor and I end up spitting it out.  If they all tasted as good as the few good ones I would have given 5 stars.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.
14777,B0047ORGWK,AFYNHATHQRU68,Helena,0/0,1332979200,My baby loves this stuff!,I bought this for the first time on Amazon a few weeks ago--the variety package and it was great (5 Stars)--powder was fresh and vibrant looking. Ran out of the peas--so thought I'd purchase it again--but without the variety pack--just the peas. This time--got a package that expires in May and the packaging was a bit different--which was fine--since it's only end of March right now--but when I opened it--the powder was stale looking (like sand)--whitish in color not the vibrant green and powder flew up in the air (like sawdust)--whereas it's usually more dense.  Too bad--my baby really liked the peas in the variety pack.
14786,B0051NJAMU,A2RNXAD1ZZMZ8,Nicole,0/0,1343865600,Best BBQ sauce,This bbq sauce is the best I have ever purchased. It comes highly recommended. We made ribs using this sauce and were very impressed. They were better than most restaurants.

However. both my husband and I thought the coffee cake I had made with the flour had a funny aftertaste. I surely thought it couldn't be the flour. So I remade the coffeecake a few weeks later with a different flour and it was really good. I'm so sorry.

14846,B003N8XO3Q,AXYPMWP12U2NT,G. Mayer Realitycheck,1/2,1286150400,How did this ever get to market?,These things taste so bad. I could not find anyone in my office who would finish one ON A BET!  They are absolutely foul.  I can't for the life of me figure out how any company would have put these on the market.  when you open them. they smell like pudding. which is a good thing except for when you actually taste them and then you feel like you've been tricked.  They have almost no taste. and the texture of melted plastic.  Another way to describe them is that it is like easting grease. except I think eating grease might be better.  And don't think the chocolate ones will be marginally better.  Snack Pack. shame on you.

It barely tastes anything like fresh. high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.  I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful.

My local grocery store was clearing it out (much to my benefit). Once I experienced it. I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out. I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again. they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is Whole Leaf Green Tea and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop.
14904,B000DZKKKC,A1UPTUHCFW18X6,FHD MOM,2/2,1318636800,YUMMMMMMMMMMM,I love these cookies.  You just mix them all up in a bowl together and bake.  I ADD MORE CHOCOLATE chips- at least 1/4 cup more of whatever flavor I am craving at the time- or better yet chop up some chunks from a semisweet baking bar!  This makes it better. I think. as it doesn't have enough chocolate in them when I really need a chocolate fix.  The package says  to melt the butter.  You do not have to do that if you have a hand mixer with some guts.  Just use soft butter or butter substitute.  Also. watch how long they cook as mine never need the full time.  My kids like them softer so I bake shorter for them and make a crispier tray for me.  The only caveat is that each bag only makes a small batch and it is expensive.  BUT this is the BEST tasting gluten free mix I have ever found.  My kids love them and they are eaten quickly.
14911,B000DZKKKC,A1YOAJZ1M1CJDV,C. Harr,2/2,1226793600,Great for the whole family!,These cookies are every bit as good as their gluten counter part.  Simple to make. Delicious and much cheaper than purchasing the already made. pre packaged gluten free cookies.

14948,B001LO501S,A27NVONAMPYGSY,K. Lore,0/0,1313193600,Delicious!,First. I do have to say that this juice does NOT look like the picture: it's grayer and more translucent. even after shaking to redistribute the pulp. It won't make pretty mixed drinks. But it is - HANDS DOWN - the *best* tasting pineapple juice I have ever had. And the fact that it's organic and ALL juice. no concentrate or water hijinks. makes me even happier! I will be drinking this juice as long as they keep making it.

14983,B000EGZ99M,A2P4M971556NDD,D. Simonson,17/18,1168041600,Good buy!,I'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile. and it's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores. This is a very great pasta at a reasonable price. I've been very pleased with this pasta. One thing - If you are accustomed to the enriched wheat (non-whole grain) orzo. this is a lot firmer - and another thing I've noticed is that It develops a grainy texture if I leave a pasta in the fridge overnight.

I have found that with this seasoning. Vegetable Magic. that I do not have to use anything else when seasoning my food. It has just the right amount of spiciness to it. We use it on everything. including meats. soups. etc. Not only vegetables. I would give this 5 stars and would recommend it 100%. We tried it about a year ago for the first time. We went through a whole canister in a year and there are only 2 people at home. It goes far. but we love it!! I just got another one!!

Started when I did Fit for Life and was stir frying veggies.  My family loved the veggies. they were finished every night.  I've been using it ever since. on veggies and meat.  Great in hamburgers. on pork chops. chicken. etc.  It's our favorite of all the seasonings that Chef Paul sells. My grown children with families of their own are using it too.  I've also used it in some of my home made salad dressings.

15094,B002076V22,A30DWKEDHUXWUG,Wayne Martin,0/0,1340582400,great oatcakes,Found these in Scotland and fell in love with them.  I was a bit disappointed to find out this type isn't gluten free.  Will order those next time.  Delicious with a bit of soft cheese.
15095,B002076V22,A1E8CWT6R5GGEJ,Breezeie,0/0,1337212800,Good but old,I think if I had received fresh crackers this rating would have been a five.  Purchased off the discount deal last month and the Sell By date was June 2012.  Got a case of 6 and got rid of 3 due to opening the first box and the oil was going rancid. I was really disappointed because the cracker was. even with the off taste. one of the best I have had Gluten Free.  So now I open the package and leave it open two days and then the taste is not bad with cheese or some topping.  So I am going to try some fresh ones when I have some extra cash or can buy them at the local Whole Foods to see if they are better.
15097,B002076V22,A1MJSWI87ZME83,Gillian,1/2,1272672000,Excellent oatcakes,As others have said. these are a little dry. but they have a very nice flavour. and they are very healthy. Other brands of oatcakes can contain sugar and more fat. these contain no added sugar. The organic oatcakes can be eaten on their own. but they are excellent with a thin slice of cheese. or spread with a little hummus. I prefer Nairns Cheese Oatcakes for eating on their own. but because they contain cheese they do have more fat and less fiber than the organic variety.
15099,B002076V22,A26YL09TMNNIKR,Diver Bill,0/2,1327536000,Good stuff,I liked them.  Nice taste. no added sugar or flavorings.  The reviewer who did not like them might prefer to stick to crisps (potato chips)or larded up sugar biscuits (cookies).
15113,B0013E21V8,AJAEA74EF21NF,motheroflittle,16/18,1223683200,Highland Sugarworks Syrup is the best,This syrup is so good. I do not usually like maple syrup but this one is delicious. It does not have an overly strong maple flavor but is very sweet. I will puchase again based on flavor.its organic.great price. made in USA/Vermont. Maple Syrup just does not get any better than this. They do need to use stonger shipping boxes and wipe the jugs. I had sugar ants in my box but not in my syrup.
15120,B0013E21V8,A1VZ5LHEQQXV27,Simonsays,2/2,1329177600,A truly natural sweetener...,As we try to eliminate white sugar. high fructose corn syrup. and artificial sweeteners from our diet. organic maple syrup is a wonderful natural sweetener. Have tried other brands. grades. and nonorganic. Highland Sugarworks is by far the favorite. We always go back to this one. Perfect on pancakes and waffles. oatmeal. add to a smoothie. drizzle on ice cream. With Amazon's autoship. the price is reasonable. It's delicious. (The kids still prefer the yucky table syrup with artificial everything. Oh. well. We are no longer buying that junk so they'll eventually appreciate the good stuff. Tip: never start with the yucky stuff.)
15121,B0013E21V8,A3VGU77H4R426G,CB,2/2,1323475200,Good deal!,The syrup is organic and pure maple syrup. it tastes great and is about 1-3 dollars cheaper than thre store syrup that is not organic plus no tax - so all and all you can't beat it.
15137,B0013E21V8,A3FCUDTGGK1V33,Insanity,1/1,1301184000,Amazing Maple Syrup,Ever since my first taste of Highland Sugarworks Dark Amber Grade A Maple Syrup. I fell in love.<br />This stuff is pure gold.  By far one of my favorite things in the entire world.<br />This on pancakes. waffles. or bacon is just magical.<br /><br />I will never buy regular High Fructose Corn Syrup ever again in my life. Once you go Maple. you never go back. I could never see myself going to IHOP or Denny's and attempt to order pancakes. it just wouldn't be the same.<br /><br />Highland Sugarworks has gained a customer for life.<br />It's just that good.
15138,B0013E21V8,AP91IOXCFBOAN,Tammy,1/1,1301011200,Best Pure Maple Syrup We've Found,We love this Highland Sugarworks Pure Organic Maple Syrup. The color. taste. and clarity are all excellent. It doesn't have any plastic jug taste. which I was concerned about. It's delicious. And. the price is good. The price is very good if you buy it through the Amazon Auto-Ship program like we do. The jug is a 2 recyclable plastic. We highly recommend this syrup!

15184,B000HALT80,A3EDFZVHY77HWW,Stephen Barker,8/8,1302134400,What a change!!,We used Royal Canin Indoor Mature 27 Cat Food after having used Royal Canin Indoor 27 regular formula.  Not only did our cat's coat improve. but her feces do not have the unpleasant odor they used to have when she was fed other food.  She is now 13 years old and extremely healthy.  This food is expensive but worth it!!
15187,B000HALT80,AFKT81UTB94L5,Jason Fisher,6/6,1316390400,Great Product,My 12 year old cat loves this food and seems to be shedding less since switching to this food.  All of my cats are on Royal Canin products. it's a high quality brand.
15189,B000HALT80,A2NV6EVUDPV0OP,Mary Jfitzpatrick CrazyMary,4/4,1319500800,Good for protein sensitive cats,My vet recommended this years ago for my cat who has a digestive tract the size of dental floss. Always got at Pet Smart. Cheaper on Amazon and delivered right to my door.
15190,B000HALT80,A1ZFTROS0C3TVZ,GK,3/3,1332979200,Great food that my 16-year old cat loves,Judging how swiftly my cat eats this food she truly likes it.<br />Plus. apparently it's a good stuff for older cats because it's a non-prescription and easily found dry food with one of the lowest phosphorus levels (0.73%). which is quite beneficial for older cats' kidneys.<br />I can heartily recommend it!<br />Especially at such fantastic (and unbeatable anywhere!) price at Amazon.
15213,B000SSV9X6,A1NBVSNU3Q0D2G,Zenia S. Woo,0/1,1244505600,very good,Finally found this products. I like it very much.Hope can get more different kinds of chips from Calbee.
15219,B00503DP0O,A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,Bali Bound,0/0,1311724800,I love them!,Gluten free products can be hit or miss.  I'm fairly new to living the gluten free lifestyle. and I've often been surprised by how bad some gluten free products can be.  I've had good luck with Pamela's products so far.  I noticed several people didn't like Pamela's Coconut Whenever bars. but I loved them!<br /><br />I think the size is just right for a snack. and they are moist and chewy.  The coconut flavor seemed authentic to me. not artificial.  There was just the right amount of chocolate to round out the flavor.  The chewy texture was just right as well. although every now and then I hit a piece of a hull or something that was unexpected.<br /><br />I've pretty much given up on most baked goods since giving up gluten.  I have no idea if I would like these bars as much if I were still able to eat 'regular' food.  Overall. I think they are very good for a gluten free product and it's something I'd like to have again.
15224,B00503DP0O,A3JISS7CQJF8JL,Joy V. Smith Pagadan,0/0,1311638400,A pleasant and healthy snack,I'm used to eating crispy and crunchy cereal/snack bars. so the Whenever bars were a surprise.  I still prefer a crunchy snack. but these are good for those who like their snacks soft.  They're not too dry. and many of the ingredients are organic.  You can see the chocolate chunks. but the overwhelming taste is coconut.  One family member said that she could taste the chocolate. and that it was moist--not like the dry bars.  It's not pretty. but it seems to be healthy.
15248,B00503DP0O,A18MBO1U4DPY20,Harkanwar Anand,1/1,1329436800,Awful to taste.,These taste really awful. I've tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible. My guests weren't delighted when I asked them to try these. Don't recommend.
15252,B00503DP0O,A1Q0Q6S0Z0V37Y,Dhampir Gamer Geek,1/1,1313625600,Reminds me of a cookie,When these came home. I was less skeptical about what I was getting. The name says it all. oat. coconut and chocolate. in a bar form. Sounds more like a cookie to me. Tasted a lot more like a cookie than a bar that was healthy for me. Which is good. I want to taste my food and know it's healthy. than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely. so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the coconut. but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of. with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.<br /><br />I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting. small cookie.
15260,B00503DP0O,A2J5GKJ0N47B2K,M. Stevens,0/0,1349568000,One of THE best Gluten free foods I've had!,Love this Oat Choco Chip Coconut bar. Soft. tender. delicious! The best oatmeal cookie ever! It is a treat. dessert at the end of a meal. Great for sweet tooth!
15282,B00503DP0O,A1FEVNKKDXU5NA,Mushuk,0/0,1315785600,Delightful Snack/Dessert,I had no reason to buy a gluten-free bar. but the reviews won me over. These are incredible! They taste great -- chocolatey with hints of coconut -- and they actually stave off my hunger for more than twenty minutes. which no snack bar has ever done. Even shortly after eating something like a clif bar I'm ready to gnaw someone's arm off. I'll eat one of these before I go for a long run; it doesn't weigh me down. but I have something in me so I don't feel nauseous afterward. I bought these on sale. but I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy them at the non-sale price. That in itself is an amazing review coming from me.
15287,B00503DP0O,A3I9MCGO36KZ7V,Shawn Kovacich Author and Creator of numerou...,0/0,1313625600,Taste Great. But The Cost Is Ridiculous,These are the oat chocolate chip coconut bars. These are a soft. cookie-like bar that is wheat and gluten free and have no dairy in them. They also have Omega 3 fatty acids. whole grains. and no trans fats.<br /><br />The bars taste pretty good. although I couldn't really taste the coconut in them. They had a hint of chocolate without being overpowering. The oats were a rolled oats but it was not over powering like some granola bars. The bar is about two inches by three inches and a prefect little snack.<br /><br />On the downside. the bars are really crumbly. almost like there is nothing really holding them together. Because of that. I had to keep them in a container to carry them in my munchie bag.  The bars are real small and are 180 calories. And finally. for five bars. the regular price on Amazon is listed as $30 but they are now discounted to $24.<br /><br />Although they might taste good. I will not be buying these. That is way too much money for three or four bites of a very crumbly cookie.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.
15290,B00503DP0O,A1S27P7KJO9I96,Eric A. Hofstetter,0/0,1313366400,Great snack for coconut lovers,The Pamela's Products Whenever Bars in Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut flavor are a great snack.  The bar has a oatmeal cookie flavor and consistency.  They are not low in fat. so one is more than enough.  I highly recommend for those who love chocolate and coconut and are looking for a somewhat healthy snack.
15293,B00503DP0O,AHFGCH8LANEZK,Dana G.,0/0,1312934400,Tasty enough. but I need more protein,I don't suffer from Celiacs Disease or any other dietary problem. so from my average-person standpoint these bars are pretty okay.  I feel that they are kind of high in calories and very low in protein for me to be eating whenever.  I'm more of a Zone Bar or Atkins Bar kind of person in that I need the high protein punch of at least 10 grams. a lot more than the 2 grams provided with this bar.  The part of the taste that stuck with me was the oats.  I love oats but I kept feeling them in my mouth like it was plastic or something hard.  I just felt it was a little too oaty for me.  I love coconut. but I didn't even notice it.  I'm sure someone who hates coconut would definitely notice. but the overall taste was quite sweet. so it just mixed in with everything else.  These bars withstood the heat test - the box was sitting in my mailbox for at least four hours in the South Texas heat in the middle of July.  I did stick them in the fridge when I got them. but when I ate the bars they were not melted or deformed in any way.<br /><br />I like the ingredients in the bars - lots of organics. real food products and not many undecipherable ingredients.  I would say if you need wheat-free. gluten-free and/or non-dairy snacks. give this a try you may really appreciate it.
15298,B00503DP0O,A3D9NUCR4RXDPY,Kathleen San Martino,0/0,1312588800,Delicious coconut taste. gluten-free oats is the first ingredient,These Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are very good to me. They are the size of a thick medium cookie. are slightly chewy. and are very tasty despite the fact that they do not taste sweet at all.<br /><br />Although coconut is lower in the ingredient list. the cookie tastes mostly like coconut and I didn't taste the chocolate at all.  However. since I like coconut very much. I enjoyed these bars.<br /><br />The first three ingredients in order are gluten-free oats. organic agave. and a rice blend. As for the rest of the cookie's name. chocolate chunks is the fourth ingredient and coconut is the tenth ingedient. The cookie contains eggs and almonds as well. The package claims that you get 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and 9 grams of whole grain per bar.<br /><br />Each bar is 180 calories with 80 calories from fat. Nevertheless. these are certainly a better choice than a candy bar and are gluten free. I really like the taste and chewy texture of these bars even though there was absolutely no chocolate taste to me.
15301,B00503DP0O,A31RULW0KNYJ5H,LA,0/0,1312416000,Tasty. Healthy Snack,These Whenever Bars taste like soft chocolate chip cookies. The coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting.<br /><br />Don't be deceived by the size of the package. The wrapper is much larger than the bar. Still. it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable 180 calories.<br /><br />I eat them around mid-morning or as a late night snack. I do not avoid gluten. wheat. or dairy (these bars are wheat-free. gluten-free. and non-dairy) but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats. agave. chia seeds. brown rice flour. etc.<br /><br />Once these become available in the Subscribe and Save program I feel certain I will subscribe. They are great to have around for a low calorie. sweet treat.
15311,B00503DP0O,A2L9OPJAAEK08Q,spin_nin,0/0,1312156800,Surprisingly good,I was a little skeptical when ordering this product. With everything it had going for it I figured there had to be a catch. Wheat-Free. Gluten-free. Non-Dairy - I wasn't expecting much in the way of flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that. while it seems subdued. there is flavor and it's alright. I can taste the chocolate & the coconut predominately. As it states on the box. they are moist & chewy. I wasn't a fan of the texture at first but by the time I got to the 3rd bar it was fine.<br /><br />What I didn't like is that one bar has 180 calories (80 of which come from fat). So much for a healthy whenever bar.<br /><br />15mg of Cholesterol. 130mg of sodium (yikes). 23g Total Carbohydrates. 2g of dietary fiber. 8g of sugar. 2g of protein.<br /><br />It also states that there are 180mg Omega 3 fatty acids. 9 grams of whole grains. & 0 grams trans fats.<br /><br />The numbers above are for 1 bar which = 1 serving.<br /><br />This product contains coconut. eggs. soy. and almonds. It is processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts. other tree nuts. soy. and milk.<br /><br />So this isn't something I would personally chose to get again. They're alright in terms of flavor but they just seem to have too much of a downside when inspecting the label.
15322,B00503DP0O,AD34TCPEP7P84,J. Nitzky,0/0,1311811200,delicious gluten free cookie!,These Oat Chocolate chip coconut bars are delicious - they are very soft. with a slight crunch and have a good chocolate and oatmeal flavor. I barely taste any coconut though - just a hint.  I would say that you would not even know you are eating a gluten-free. non-dairy snack! they are are great substitute for oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies anyday (if you like soft cookies).  This is a great snack to put in the lunch bag. backpack. briefcase and purse just to have something in the middle of the day to keep you going or enjoy a little snack break!<br /><br />Here are some of the facts:<br />Calories: 180<br />total fat: 9g(zero trans fat)<br />Carbs: 23g<br />Fiber: 2g<br />Sugar: 8g<br />Protein: 2g
15326,B00503DP0O,A1BVFLQ89LAI0K,WonderBunny,0/0,1311724800,Not at all what I expected,I wasn't sure what to expected with these bars. I am not a huge energy bar fan. I find them too heavy and even after spending eight hours of hiking. I can only eat half of an energy bar. I admit. that I was expected the same thing with these. Instead. I got a light and almost cookie like bar that was delicious. I would have never guessed that they were gluten free because I've tried gluten free food and this was nothing like that. This bar was a perfect afternoon snack that was chewy and light. I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor that wasn't overpowering. I had eaten the entire bar before I knew it and found it kept me going all afternoon too. I think I might have found a new hiking snack! Yay!

The product is very sweet and sugars up if saved for a long time after it is opened. I wish Monin would make a sugar free version of this flavor. but no luck yet. This particular product is so good you can taste a bit of graham cracker just like the pie.  Highly recommend this product. and if you like. add equal parts vanilla vodka and pineapple juice for an amazing cocktail.

Unfortunately. its hard to find near me. and when I can find it. I only can find the small jar (which never lasts long). Finding a huge canister like this on amazon was just the thing. Can now use it on everything without fear of running out... try it on your fries.. trust me!
15399,B000FAAY4M,A10UV0T9R1U3RH,Annie Amazon Consumer,3/3,1251244800,Bisto Favourite is the BEST brown gravy thickener in the world!,Bisto is hands down the best! My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour. corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor. color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally. I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate. pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i/o something dry and bland.<br /><br />You'll never fail at gravy-making with Bisto Favourite!
15421,B000PG1D1O,A1TB6EJFXJDW12,shaygfx,4/4,1336003200,Cinnamon Spice,I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now. and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse. I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words Super Dieters I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package. and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits. and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine. I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
15425,B000PG1D1O,AVD4CW13F9JF5,Betty Boop,5/6,1215993600,Good Product,I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied. It works very well. I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be too good.

15490,B000255OIG,A2G1LRD120SJPC,K. Hill,0/0,1303171200,Excellent Product and Made in U.S.A.,My three very finicky dogs love this product. and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training.  There is only one ingredient in this: liver. all sourced within the United States. so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs.  I buy this on a regular basis.  It's priced better than any pet supply store I've seen. even the larger chains.  Qualifies for free shipping. which is also nice.

The treats are 50% crude protein so you are getting a high quality treat.  Just make sure your dog has enough water since the treats make  my dogs thirsty.
15497,B000255OIG,AYS3F0L3VFP6G,Regan,0/0,1297900800,Great training treats!,Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?). cooked meat (which is gross to handle). or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand. are very affordable. not gross to handle. and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also. being as they're only beef liver. I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

The only problems I've encountered with these are the left over powder at the bottom and the sizes are not uniform; many big pieces and many very small pieces (very minor problems). But they are all natural and don't upset my dogs stomachs.

You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats. not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction. because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away. it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.

15644,B000255OIG,A1WZWIME0UDS0M,mischasays,0/0,1321660800,Great treat. but probably not for small dogs,These treats are similar to the PureBites. however. since I have small dogs (Peke mix). I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths. so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites. on the other hand. are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way. so if I had larger dogs. I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

15650,B000255OIG,ADODIH2V6UBQ9,R. Miller,0/0,1315008000,My dog would do anything for this treat,By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay. but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it. we will give 2 of the small ones. and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries. spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website. the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago. created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner. and the name stuck.<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black. using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife. who will often add creamer to darker roasts. also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary. this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents. 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes. but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08>Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC>Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2>Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G>Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE>Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y>Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW>Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS>Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI>Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

I was looking for a good MEDIUM ROAST-NON FLAVORED kcup and this is it. Just right for an everyday cup of coffee. No bitterness. and low acidity.

I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel. blueberry. etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other brands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium.

15901,B001NGASKC,A8X6MT614GS9B,P. M. Green Lighthouse Lady,2/2,1252540800,Addictive!!,I'm on my second order of this mix and had to buy an extra one for a friend that's hooked on this too.  Great taste although maybe not what you're expecting if you make the Americanized version of chili.  Smells wonderful while simmering.  I have changed the recipe a bit......use 2 - 14oz cans of Mexican style chunk tomatoes; 1 - 1 1/2 lbs ground round; and I use cider vinegar (1/3 cup) instead of red wine vinegar.
15909,B000F9XBD4,A2R6RA8FRBS608,Matthew G. Sherwin,0/1,1187136000,all right by me !!!,Nabisco Big Wheat Thins taste great despite a name that didn't exactly excite me about trying them. They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe<br /><br />The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving--hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover. the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course. you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers. now would you?<br /><br />Overall. Wheat Thins are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!
15925,B000P566K8,A2E5C8TTAED4CQ,S. Linkletter,8/9,1297728000,Nice Taste. But ...,First of all. when I purchased this product it was listed as two 3-packs for the price.  I only received one 3-pack.  Amazon kindly refunded half of my money. but note that I would not have purchased the product at the current offer of one 3-pack for the same price.<br /><br />Black sugar is reputed to be eaten in Japan as a candy.  This black sugar tastes very nice that way. a bit like the penuche that I made as a child that didn't get cooked long enough and was partially crystallized when it cooled.  Add molasses taste to that. and I think that is pretty close.<br /><br />This black sugar is not uniformally dark throughout.  When you break the brick. in cross-section it is only dark for about one quarter of the way in from the surface top and bottom. and the same absolute distance on the sides.  The inner one-half is the color of light brown sugar.  I don't know what to make of that.  I don't know if it is normal for black sugar to be light brown inside.  Presumably the darkness is from the molasses. but I don't know why the molasses would look like it had soaked in from the outside instead of being uniformally distributed in the sugar brick.  The dark brown raw sugar from Africa. that I also bought. is uniformally dark but not as dark as the outside of this black sugar brick.  I imagine that if I pulverized the inner and outer sections of this Okinawa black sugar together I might get the same color as the dark brown sugar from Africa.  I haven't tried the experiment because the black sugar brick is not easily pulverized. although it is not too hard to bite.<br /><br />In summary. the taste is quite nice but I'm not at all sure that it is novel enough for the price I paid. let alone twice that much.  However. it is a taste of food from a place that I have never been and never will go. so I gave it four stars.
15941,B000PDRYPQ,A1B3IPJKCCWVEI,dunite,2/2,1227830400,A California Original!,The Previous reviews sums up the quality taste of this product.I found this product almost 20 years ago at a diner in Pismo Beach.At the time the Pepper Plant was a local (Atascadero) mom & pop operation and couldn't be found south of Santa Barbara or north of San Luis Obispo.I was living an hour north of San Francisco and was fortunate enough to purchase the sauce at the diner.I purchased 4 bottles and hit that diner about every 6 months for years.The company was purchased by a larger gourmet foods manufacturer in Gilroy and didn't change a thing.If anything it was a benefit for the product as it is now in the heart of where the ingredients are grown.I was able to get my local Whole Foods to carry Pepper Plant and another store across town.I have noticed that people are discovering the fantastic flavor of a California original and hope more people discover the best pepper sauce in the west.The bar-b-que sauce is excellent too.

15953,B000PDRYPQ,A1L3ZWYV9NOO59,David Rose,1/2,1261612800,Great on Eggs!,I bought this years ago. after using it in a restaurant. It goes great on eggs and hash browns. It's my favorite breakfast sauce. I found other selections at [...].

15962,B0001AUB9E,A3J24BXMI93LRW,Lawrence Gilchrist,0/0,1337299200,DEMAND YOUR LOCAL GROCER CARRY THIS PRODUCT,Local store's discontinued sale - 3.50 USD.<br /><br />I bought a jar.<br /><br />Upon eating some I was stunned at what was happening to my mouth. Eager to replicate the impossible. I took another spoonful.<br /><br />The next day I bought the rest of the jars. There are no more jars. After the last I slept for 20 hours.<br /><br />I'm scared. If I order more. part of me will be satiated. but at a terrible cost to my faculties. The agonizing wait makes purchasing a zero sum game.<br /><br />Apricots taste like ash now.
15964,B0025UNW4E,A1003ACBU13X6E,Juliette,1/1,1306454400,delicious; easy; nearly as good as fresh lemonade,I really like lemonade. but without the sugar. and this fits the bill when I don't have fresh lemons.  For a large glass I use 4 packets. add stevia instead of sugar. plus ice and. voila. a refreshing summer drink.  It does contain soy. however. whereas the True Lime does not.  Why it needs to have soy in it is anyone's guess.  The True Lemon store sells the product cheaper than Amazon.
16015,B0009YWMYE,A3MRWCBCHN31A7,Kar,2/2,1277683200,Excellent nutrition. picky eater likes it,Corn is BAD for dogs!  When I learned that. I switched immediately to food that doesn't have any in it (and most well known. readily available brands do).<br /><br />Our dog is very sensitive. and while she seemed to be doing well with BB's Wilderness Chicken. her poo smelled to the high heavens.  I read that it's often due to their not digesting chicken well; I guess she doesn't.  So. I switched her to the Lamb/Brown Rice formula.  She likes it. and. happily for everyone in the neighborhood. can digest it MUCH better (if you go by the stink factor).<br /><br />The only way she'll really go for it with enthusiasm (or any dry food) is to add some hot water to moisten it and release some aroma.  Otherwise. she holds out 'til right before she goes to bed 'cause she's starving.<br /><br />So. if your dog doesn't seem to like it. try adding a little hot water.  Our dog trainer (20 years experience) insists it's NOT bad for their teeth to do that (which I was concerned about initially).
16016,B0009YWMYE,AUHI813UPNJ7X,Aristeros Aristeros,4/5,1232841600,LifeSource Bits,I chose this food for my dog because it was the only one without a filler ingredient high in the list.  Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past. I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall. it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.<br /><br />My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble. but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.<br /><br />If your dog is not a picky eater. the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food. you'll probably have no issues with this brand.  If your dog picks out the bits. you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different brand.
16025,B00149ZSD0,AEK402C2091V4,Patsy,0/0,1310256000,I Love the Turtles they were so good.,I love the Turtles. They were not melted. Thank you for putting a cool pak in the box. Me and my husband enjoyed it very much and planning to buy from you all in the future.
16028,B0000DG4E7,A3ULBGEVM4NCPB,Kitchen Goddess,6/6,1108425600,I've been using for years,My best friend turned me on to Cavender's back in the 70's.  I use it in so many recipes. I'd be lost without it.  It goes in salad. on pasta. on veggies and meats. in soups.  Ok. I never used it in a dessert recipe!  I backpacked up the east coast of Australia once for two months.  My Cavender's was the only thing I made sure was in my pack...the jumbo size.  I've introduced more people to this seasoning; it is the secret ingredient to some of my most popular recipes.<br /><br />Lately. I've been making simple salad - torn bibb lettuce leaves. olive oil. Cavender's. a little grated parmesan. a little balsamic vinegar.  Nothing else.  I can't get enough.
16041,B000NY8OVK,A3NVRRXHFURMC0,uruz julian1117,0/1,1228348800,German chocolates,I bought these for my 2008 Oktoberfest and because I was in beautiful Munich. Bamberg. and Nuernberg in February of 2008 and had plenty of these little Ritter Sport jewels.  You can find these packages of mini Ritters all over Germany they are so popular. but I have only seen their larger individually-wrapped cousins here on the shelves.  As with any variety pack. you get much more of a choice of experiences--some old. some new.  I think the biggest advantage to ordering this package was that I got to try so many of the Ritter Sports that I had not ever tried before.  The only disadvantage I can think of is that the chocolates were not as fresh. of course. as they are in Deutschland.  But I guess you'll have to go there to know what I mean!
16100,B004UB4BKU,AO2NHZN2NXHTY,Melissa Logan Nuni,0/0,1345507200,Convenient. tasty. organic,I love this spice mix because it's organic and makes such an easy meal. I don't follow the directions because of food sensitivities. but my way is awesome. too. I start steaming broccoli &/or cauliflower with green beans and corn. then add one can of organic coconut milk midway through (to help cut the spiciness and add creaminess). I make quinoa in another pot to eat with it. Brown rice works. too. but quinoa works better for me. Anyway. it tastes great. and it's easy and quick to make. which makes it really convenient.
16102,B000II27QE,A2ZL5W6AP7DO7N,Twal,111/128,1215734400,What's so Funny?,British food is often poorly regarded by comparison to the cuisine of our European neighbours: France. Italy. Germany and Spain. Yet in some areas Britain truly leads the world - where would we be without the sandwich. for example?<br /><br />Another area of British culinary pre-eminence is the steamed pudding. amongst which the Spotted Dick is king. As a pudding-fan. I am deeply saddened that several. rather puerile. reviewers find this name mildly amusing. I doubt they would stoop to such pathetic attempts at humour if they had bothered to taste it first.<br /><br />Take my word for it: nothing tastes better than a mouthful of dick. especially if it comes with a load of hot custard.
16129,B001RJ91IK,ADAASOYZ1TOMW,SammySosa21 sammysosa21,2/2,1345939200,Great healthy mix...,I was looking for a good mix without alot of candy coated junk mixed into it and this one does the trick. Like the other reviewer says. there are alot of peanuts and raisins. but there are plenty of cranberries & almonds in that mix as well. I would say cashews and the yogurt covered raisins (about 15 per package) are what there are the fewest of. For me that's great because im trying to lose weight but i still like the addition of a few yogurt raisins too.<br /><br />All in all 5 stars from me. you wont find a better healthy mix for around $2.50 a bag. If you get melted yogurt raisins from a hot summer delivery. just stick the entire bundled pack in the freezer when you get the package for 30-45 minutes. they come out just like new without damage to nuts.

16137,B008BMDRAE,AA9Y3LTCJQ9KB,Shoparound,0/0,1350864000,Underwhelmed,I purchased this plant as a gift for my husbands office; it looked more like the 'Charlie Brown Christmas Tree' than a bonsai tree.  Although I have to admit. it is alive and healthy.
16141,B005EL6VOY,A2DBIUHAU45A9V,irunsoicaneat,7/7,1324425600,Healthy. tasty. and versatile!,This is my first review ever on Amazon. but this product deserves attention. I have eaten this product for 5-7 days a week for an entire year now.  The only time I didn't eat it was when I was on vacation.  Even then. I began to miss it after a week.  This product is amazing. and I've yet to tire of it.  Don't get me wrong. nothing can replace hashbrowns for breakfast in the morning in terms of flavor. but this product has helped me get into the best shape of my life while still enjoying the food I eat.<br /><br />The versatility of this product is amazing.  If I want a porridge consistency. I add slightly more water. If I want a bowl of something with more chew to it I add slightly less water. If I'm extra hungry . I'll cook it on the stovetop with frozen veggies (carrots. peas. corn. broccoli. etc) with some garlic salt and hot sauce and you've got a savory and healthy dinner. If I'm in the mood for something sweet. I'll add bananas and drizzle in some honey. A bowl of this with an over-easy egg and you've got a very filling snack under 250 calories. With a regular meal. I'll sub out my starch (rice. pasta. bread) with this oatmeal for a healthy alternative. For me. I feel more full with oatmeal as the side dish probably because it fools my stomach with extra water weight but the fiber content keeps me feeling full or at least content until the next meal.<br /><br />Think outside the box and be open to new flavors and new textures. and you will thoroughly enjoy this product as much as I have. AND feel healthy doing so :)
16155,B005EL6VOY,A1FDNQSAT70KUT,R. Leun,0/0,1335398400,Coach's Oats Oatmeal,My wife loves this oatmeal and she can't always find it. I get it here for a good price. I hope they will keep carrying it.

16169,B005EL6VOY,A2JO2N97YNCD5N,S. Franklin,0/0,1323993600,Great Taste,Bought this in the Maui Costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal.  Went to our local Costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture.  This is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal.
16172,B005EL6VOY,A24SQJ8S2JVF89,MayaP,0/0,1321920000,I love this oatmeal,This oatmeal tastes great. and it has nice texture because it's steel cut. It's healthier and contains more fiber then regular mushy oatmeal. It's extremely good for you and the texture is amazing but still - it has no taste. Some people say that it has anutty taste but to me- it has no taste at all. However I cut a banana. and put a little sweetener and voila! - delish! I am now addicted to this oatmeal!
16178,B0001BVD04,A2YDEO5BR1OA5R,Pelly,5/5,1150329600,Cheaper in supermarkets,This is a great fruit soda. will surprise you if you are used to artificially flavored junk.<br /><br />BUT... It's much cheaper in supermarkets. Trader Joe's. as noted above. sells it for under $3 in a four-pack.<br /><br />There also exists an all-natural version without the preservative or artificial colors. that is sold in Whole Foods. Side by side it tastes a little better. but is more expensive. I prefer it.
16189,B0027E2M7Q,ADIKBFGQS2GHI,JBuyer,1/1,1316044800,Exactly What I Expected,I like the jars because they are a little cheaper then the plastic gerber containers. but they don't reseal as easy. If you keep the open food in the fridge for the recomended time there is no problem.
16199,B0027E2M7Q,AGEMRKQALS22P,"KC, Anglophile",2/5,1304467200,You Ladies Don't Get It,Come on now. how much of this stuff actually DOES taste and smell good to adults.  The last time I bought it at Safeway. it tasted and smelled exactly the same--it's not Amazon's fault that grown-ups would rather eat pot roast with potatoes and gravy on the side.  So. if you don't like it. fire up the blender. and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells.btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in. you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do-me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day-care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate). and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.  Now. pay more for it than at Amazon.lug it all home while balancing tons of paper towels on your head (vs. waiting for the nice-looking UPS guy to set it inside the door where all you have to do is open it and put it on the shelf.)<br /><br />I like shopping in the quiet of my cleaned up kitchen after everyone's gone to bed. paying less for it (with a Prime Membership). and just putting it away when it arrives two days later.  I think that's what we're supposed to be rating and commenting on.  This works for me and rates five stars.
16200,B0027E2M7Q,A36N62I47U9IIH,Kimiko,0/5,1300147200,The foulest thing..... ever,The beef. chicken. and turkey and gravy foods are disgusting. They are so disgusting. I didn't have the heart to feed this to my child. When I popped the lid to these the first thing I noticed was the foul smell. It made me gag. I can't even describe how bad this smelled. It was like rotten meat flavored jello. I didn't have the heart to make my daughters eat it so I gave it to my cats. None of them would go near it except for one who ate about 1/4 of it and walked away. Don't torture your child with this.
16204,B000E8Y5CC,A18BUMQUB2SREJ,MPG,2/2,1265673600,Awesome Tea!,This is the same tea they serve at PF Chang's.<br />If you like tea. you must try this. 5 star tea. excellent!

I do not like the strong robust blends that many prefer.  The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is the perfect lighter blend to exactly match my needs for a cup of coffee to start my day. When I searched on Amazon.com <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047RQ9M0>Green Mountain Coffee  Breakfast Blend.  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers. 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a> for the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend and found it at a wonderful price for three twelve packs. I had to make the purchase.  I was not disappointed.  In a couple of days I received my order.  I am drinking a cup as I write. I enjoy the flavor of the coffee with just a little sweetener added. A perfect start to my day.

After trying many different flavors over the past 18 months. I find this the most enjoyable blend yet. followed closely by Kona blend.

16341,B007TJGZ54,AO9M2LQPKQ2TS,Brenda N. Book Blogger,0/0,1298332800,Too expensive on Amazon!,This is my favorite K-cup and one my husband and I can agree on (I prefer darker roast. he likes a lighter roast coffee).  It holds up well to the cream and Splenda I add.<br /><br />However. this price is outrageous.  Far more than I pay at the grocery store.

16363,B007TJGZ54,A1GPM8XJHQL40Y,Sam samreader,0/1,1315612800,Good flavor - a little too weak for me,Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however. the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!
16378,B007TJGZ54,AWBCE19Y3ZJUW,LR,2/6,1306022400,Why use a brewer for instant coffee?,This stuff is NASTY.  I don't even think it's particularly good instant.  Why would anyone spend all that money on a keurig coffee maker in order to make instant coffee at home?  You just need a kettle or a microwave.  And what a waste of space in your kitchen and landfill.  The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it. look carefully at the package. and see that it's water soluble-- code words for instant.  Open one up. and you'll see!

I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous. but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..
16396,B007TJGZ54,A2CINB1V1HLFRP,Cecilia,1/1,1348099200,Wonderfully delicious!,My favorite to use in my Keurig. The Breakfast Blend is not too strong. but it isn't so weak that I can't taste the coffee after adding creamer. I do not like a dark roast. but I also don't like an incredibly weak roast. This blend is absolutely perfect for those who like a coffee that is just right. :)
16410,B007TJGZ54,A1K277HLLHX0CA,Dan,1/1,1335484800,Must have gotten the seconds,I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center. thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.

I can count on it for a great cup of coffee - not too strong or too mild. just the way I like it.  Unfortuantely. I now drink more coffee than I probably should because of the taste but that's the only downside.

So if you like this taste. good luck.  Let me know if you find another one; until then I will buy these from Amazon.  Thanks. guys.  :)<br /><br />They remind me a lot of a cookie that was around when I was a kid in the late 60s - early 70s.  They were square and they were called Orbits.

I drink a cup every morning before I go to work and every night before I go to bed. I love it so much that when all of the local grocery stores stopped carrying it. I drove to another city to buy it. And when that store stopped carrying it. I bought it here on Amazon. or so I thought.<br /><br />Turns out that only half of the boxes actually contained Sweet Ginger Peach Tea. Inside of each box is a sealed bag.<br />Last night I opened a box of tea. and opened the bag. made a cup of tea. and promptly spit it out.<br />It wasn't Sweet Ginger Peach tea at all. I couldn't figure it out. I pulled the bag out of the box to find out my box had been filled with a bag of Earl Grey Lavendar tea. Gross.<br /><br />I promptly opened another box to find the same thing. Out of the case of tea. half of it was Earl Grey Lavendar.<br /><br />If this case had been the Sweet Ginger Peach Tea. I would rate it five stars and tell everyone how lovely and soothing it is. But since the order was filled with boxes whose contents had been switched with something completely different. all I can do is say. save your money and your time and order elsewhere.<br /><br />EDIT!! After reading my complaint. Amazon refunded the full cost of the tea to my charge card. Their e-mail stated that they are going to investigate the issue with the packaging. I did not expect such a quick response. Hopefully they will get the issues straightened out and I can once again order this lovely tea!! Love AMAZON
16503,B000E8Y5CM,A23FQW98P2EOJY,Karen Sachs,1/4,1289174400,Nylon bags are not my idea of high quality tea,Its my understanding (based on discussions with material scientists!) that nylon releases toxins when put into hot water..so..whats the deal with the nylon tea bags?  This wasn't stated anywhere or I wouldn't have bought them.  The company told me they wee FDA approved. but the FDA is only worried about things that will kill you in the short run. or that have very high levels of dangerous chemicals.  Trace amounts are permitted.  Considering how much tea I drink. I'd rather not add toxins to my body every single time.<br /><br />In contrast Might Leaf. while they have similar looking tea bags. theirs are not nylon and are biodegradable in addition to not being dangerous.<br /><br />Very disappointed in this product.  They should at least have been upfront about the nylon bags so concerned people can avoid buying them.
16511,B002RRLZQW,A2GOWLNB6BARU5,B. Hammer,1/1,1343606400,Tasty Coffee!,This coffee is absolutely fantastic.  Yes - it's true that it's not the whole beans waiting to be ground. and I usually grind my own. but the flavor is truly amazing.<br />It has notes of chocolate and spice.  It is rich and so so tasty. I'm quite honestly a coffee snob and a bit of a foodie.<br />Of course if you like folgers. this isn't going to work for you... move along lol.<br /><br />I've been running it in my espresso / cappuccino machine.<br />Just make sure to pack it extra hard so that it flows properly.<br />Add some raw sugar and a little half and half cream.<br />You then have an incredible tasting coffee.<br /><br />I liked this so much after my first box. that I ordered 3 more boxes.<br />Each box comes with 2 mini bags in it that have co2 reducers.

I actually prefer this pasta to wheat pasta. I do not have a gluten intolerance but will continue to buy Notta Pasta instead of wheat pasta as a matter of choice. Great stuff!

The kids and I absolutely love these and the price is unbeatable from what I've seen! The local store charges about $3 for the smaller bags. and that's EACH! So glad I was able to find the 12 pack here on Amazon!<br />I don't feel near as guilty snacking on these compared to Dorito's or any other 'chip' and even feel less guilty about the kids eating them too! Absolutely YUM!

16591,B001LGGH40,A1JUBRIZMO0RJV,Steve H books911,0/0,1242864000,Gives a Punch. Quite Intense,This Switch Kiwi Berry drink comes is as great. easy to handle. streamlined candy.  However. it does delivery an intense. fruit. flavor.  Great when you really need a sweet fruit recovery from a hot summer day.  Otherwise. a bit overpowering. A nice treat though.
16611,B001LGGH40,AAZ5OJ2OOJ2DK,Kristen,0/0,1239840000,A unique go-between...,Is it a juice or is it a soda?  It's both!  Switch Kiwi Berry canned beverage has enough carbonation for it to be soda-like but it's not overpowering.  This particular flavor is made up of a variety of fruit juices. and I really didn't taste too much kiwi or strawberry.  To me. the apple juice flavor was the dominant one.  I like fruit juices and different beverage choices. and I really like the texture of this drink.  However. it is a bit too sweet for my liking and is pretty high in calories.  If the calorie count had been lower. my rating would be higher.  Children would probably really enjoy this drink. and it's definitely a healthier option than soft drinks or other sugary options.  I'd be interested to try some of the other flavors!
16621,B001LGGH40,A1F2EYORWOZ3G1,Kevin Stanton stanke36,0/0,1239840000,actually 4.5 starts,This flavor of this drink is the better of them. Really nice and sweet. Not overdone. not weak. just right. My only complaint with these drinks is that they are carbonated. I wish they weren't. But if I had to choose between this and the other... I would choose this flavor again.
16626,B001LGGH40,A3LVTATM6TO27B,M. T. Vancampen,0/0,1239321600,Pleasant Taste if a Little Too Sweet,I was intrigued by this product.  Once it arrived. my son was as well.  So. I shared it and anothere flavor with him.  My assessment was that it has a pleasant taste but--unless I had read the can--I am not sure I would be able to identify it as Kiwi-Berry.  It also has a slight aftertaste--not unpleasaant. but just there.  Also. I am not too sure I need the carbonation with fruit juice.  My 8 year old son on the other hand loved it.  He raved about the taste and the bubbles. claiming it tastes like Sprite only much better.  He seemed to like this and the other flavors about the same.  I would suggest this as something to try. but hesitate on buying more since the price is realtively high compared to other beverage options.
16641,B001LGGH40,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,Woopak The THRILL,0/0,1238803200,Tastes like Carbonated Plastic....,The first Switch carbonated drink I tried from the amazon vine program is the watermelon-strawberry and now. here I am trying the kiwi-berry flavor. I've said before that I am not a fan of carbonated drinks and this flavor just reminded me why.<br /><br />There's no taste of berry nor kiwi in it. and the thing just flat out tastes like carbonated plastic. For a drink claiming to be all natural. no sugar. or preservatives...it sure tastes quite like the opposite. Now I don't know if I just received a defective can. but it isn't it sure didn't quench my thirst and I needed to eat a hot pocket just to get rid of the odd after taste. Cool packaging. less than good taste.<br /><br />I didn't like it! [2 Stars]
16644,B001LGGH40,ANKQGTXHREOI5,Titanium Lili,0/0,1238803200,Mediocre beverage,I had previously imbibed a couple other flavors of Switch beverages. and I liked them a good bit.  This one was not bad. but certainly unremarkable.  The kiwi flavor was not very prominent. and I had to really try to distinguish that there was any kiwi flavor at all.  The berry is more what I tasted.  Since I'd like the other flavors so well. I was expecting I'd like this one as well. but I didn't even bother finishing the drink.  Other people might like it better. but I found it to be too sweet and not all that worthy of drinking.
16647,B001LGGH40,A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H,B. Niedt,0/0,1238803200,Not Up to Par Taste-wise,I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor. but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate. the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y. not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice). but they need to get the flavor right.
16650,B001LGGH40,A2KX7C5O86E58,Twilightjoan,0/0,1238630400,Tasty Natural Soda - But a Little Strong,The drink flavor is Kiwi Berry but I tasted a lot of flavors in it besides Kiwi and Berry. There are six fruit juice concentrates included. Note that Kiwi. although listed first on the can label before Berry. is the third fruit listed on the ingredient panel after Apple and Grape. Acerola (Barbados cherry or wild crapemyrtle per Wikipedia). Raspberry and Strawberry are listed as numbers 4. 5 and 6.<br /><br />I tried the beverage cold without ice then with ice.  Even drinking it a little later after it got watered down with the ice it was still a strong flavor and still tasted carbonated.  I noted that there was no aftertaste from Kiwi that I find in other drinks like Hansen.<br /><br />I don't believe the smaller size (8.3 oz.) was created for children. I think it is small to compete with the energy drinks out there that seem to appear in a similar size can.  HOWEVER. there is no caffeine. no added sugar. no guarana. or other energy added ingredients in this drink so it is safe for children and adults who do not wish to drink stimulant type drinks.  But. another HOWEVER is that this drink is 135 calories just for 8.3 ounces. 34 carbs including 33g of sugar (natural from the fruit juice concentrates).  There is 15mg of sodium and 100% of an adults daily requirement of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I am not sure if I would buy this drink again but it does taste nice.  I would like to try some other flavors from The Switch. however.  This one might make a good base for a punchbowl drink (with ice cream?)<br /><br />I think I should have given this drink fewer stars. now that I think about it.
16663,B001LGGH40,ACAXV4V8PBCE3,Texas Rose Roseanna,0/0,1238544000,Still too much carbonation,This product label says that it is the perfect balance between juice and carbonation. but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also. I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi/berry. and they are all mostly apple. grape. and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called Kiwi Berry. but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added. but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid. we are drinking 135 empty calories;however. this is a high level of vitamin C. Also. children will probably like these really sweet flavors. so this could be an alternative to offer the little ones.
16667,B001LGGH40,A3GZH53OZKWOZ1,Sheryl Spencer Dustwolf,0/0,1238457600,A Delicious Switch,I absolutely Love this drink. This is the best carbonated fruit drink I have ever tasted. This has a crisp. clean taste of fresh strawberry with just a hint of kiwi. This tastes just as you would expect a pure fruit juice to taste. except without the pulp and a carbonation that makes it fun for both kids and adults alike. I found a new fruit juice that I love and I'm making the switch to Switch.
16671,B001LGGH40,AN9J46667D80O,"Chris Swanson I'm just this guy, you know?",0/0,1238371200,Technically drinkable.,This is the second flavor of Switch I've had and it was... not terribly pleasant. First off. it seemed rather syrupy. but then I realized that's just because the sweetness factor is. apparently. set to eleven. It wasn't actually a struggle to finish it. but it was so cloyingly sweet it makes the average episode of Full House look like sour. cynical crap. It made me want to reach for insulin. though I don't take any.<br /><br />I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who don't have well-developed palettes. but if you're past the age of. say. nine. this probably isn't the drink for you.
16674,B001LGGH40,AZM8N4NZCHYPM,turtle,0/0,1238371200,All-natural Strawberry Fanta,You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural. It's an all-natural strawberry flavored Fanta!
16678,B001LGGH40,A13MZ8L5DC4JHC,Chelsea Chelsea H.,0/0,1238025600,Great alternative to Soda for your little one!,While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola. this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice. not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great!
16697,B001LGGH40,AJ0HFDY5BB77Y,Michael Trotman,4/5,1235952000,Too sweet and syrupy for my taste...,I'm a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill.  Imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have The Switch.  I had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it's anything but refreshing.
16706,B001LGGH40,A2I5LVVQ7WXEH6,JEFFREY SMITH Jeff Smith,0/0,1237420800,Switch Kiwi Berry,This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas. but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories. and. the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But. the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others. like the cherry which I also got.
16709,B001LGGH40,A24O15MYDNLZBE,Lori Smart Amazon Queen,0/0,1237420800,Great Flavor. A Little Too Sweet,Great change from artificially flavored soda. but it was almost sweet enough to be a concentrate. We mixed it up 50/50 with club soda and it was perfect!
16721,B001LGGH40,A39ISGPKMF9X0R,Alan Craig,0/0,1237334400,Sweet,I found the Switch Kiwi Berry Flavor to be good enough. but a little too sweet for my personal taste. I liked the fact that it was overly carbonated. and the amount in the can is just right. not too much to drink<br />at one time. It makes portion control easy. Would I buy it instead of a soda? Maybe not.
16727,B001LGGH40,A3UOS7EC0NN88A,Jonathan Strawn,0/0,1237248000,Tasty and refreshing,This is what happens when you try to cross a juice with a soda and it somehow works.  Carbonated. slightly sweet. and 100% juice. this drink gives you the bubbly soda experience without the sticky sweetness that makes you feel slightly ill.  The berry flavor is not too strong and the carbonation is just the right amount.<br /><br />The only downside is the size of the can.  For some reason this comes in Red Bull-sized cans. which leave you wanting more.  A regular 12 oz soda can would have served this excellent drink better.
16734,B001LGGH40,A1R9QOPV6HVEKF,Adam F. Jewell,0/0,1237161600,Sweet Fruity Drink. Better For You Than Soft Drinks. Why Not Just Drink Water?,This tastes very similar to <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54>The Switch Watermelon Strawberry. 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and seems to be identical except for a touch of Kiwi and Strawberry juice.  Its got 135 calories so is not a diet drink.  It's really sweet and would go well as a drink mixer like the watermelon strawberry variety.<br /><br />It's got light carbonation. 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C and costs about $1.00 a can.  Personally. I'll stick to plain old tap water because this is really just extra calories and not worth $1.00 a can.  It is a nice fruity sweet drink that many might like to go along with lunch.
16737,B001LGGH40,AA98O5326L88T,Aaron Silverman DJ Kuul A,0/0,1237161600,Not bad. but it should be called The Switch Apple. Grape. Kiwi & Berry,This was a pretty good idea -- it's basically juice from concentrate that's been reconstituted with sparkling instead of plain water. As such. it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans. it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure. it has a fair amount of sugar. but it's not a diet product. And for most people. it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can. even when purchased by the case. this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits. but in this case it's really noticeable.  However. it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor -- the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two. go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice. that could be enough to ruin this drink for you.
16744,B001LGGH40,A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,Molly P.,0/0,1236988800,Sweetness Overload,My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase. Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar. even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant. overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all. it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse -- it had a kind of chemical-y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy. go ahead and try Switch.  But if not -- avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix.
16747,B001LGGH40,A1NGFGBX2VCQS8,Ralph Furlong,0/0,1236988800,Looking for a replacement for soda?,Are you looking for a relatively healthy option for soda?  well. look no further!  This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of the things I like. and the things that I did not like as much:<br /><br />First. the positive:<br /><br />The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor. that means Kiwi and Berry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable. which is very nice!<br /><br />The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.<br /><br />The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you. but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes. I know you can always pour out what is more than want. but how often does that happen?<br /><br />The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch. brief case. computer case. etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty. the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people.<br /><br />The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 135 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison. Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson. a serving size of Coca-cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So. do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!<br /><br />I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line. but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses. 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.<br /><br />Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.<br /><br />Ok. so overall. this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink. just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!<br /><br />The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count. the price. the volume you need to order. and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that. no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives).
16766,B001LGGH40,ALEUQQE118NEW,Irvin Goodman,0/0,1236470400,A Winning Switch Beverage,This new refreshing drink has no sugar added. no corn syrup. no preservatives. no artificial colors and is gluten free !  It provides a convenient container of 8.3 ounces of 100 % tasty juice with plenty of Vitamin C.  If you want a nice afternoon pick-up. you'll enjoy this drink !
16791,B001LGGH40,AHRNDSKWH1YBT,M. Hertzler,0/0,1236211200,WHOO WEE That is a Sweet Drink!!,Don't get me wrong. it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so. It is just big enough to quench your thirst before it gets warm.<br /><br />But WOW. it was sweet. I mean. this is Kool-aid meets Grenadine syrup with some lemon-lime soda tossed in. So if you are looking for something like soda water with a slight flavor. just keep going. If you want a sweet drink to get rid of a craving. then this is for you!
16794,B001LGGH40,A17771LTRWSKQ5,Helen S. Lam,0/0,1236211200,Good but not out of this world,It is a good concept to carbonate juice.  The kids loved it and called it soda.  It has a nice flavor but it is difficult to taste the individual fruit juices though.
16795,B001LGGH40,A1OMHUU58XHQNG,SKY2110 SKY2110,0/0,1236211200,nice alternative to regular soda,it' an okay drink and didn't have a harsh or oddly synthetic taste to it as some juice drinks have. yet it wasn't anything super.<br /><br />This is a nice alternative to regular soda. but I don't see myself buying it that often. The high carbonation makes it less healthy than it is touted and is bad for your stomach. Too bad they didn't make it less carbonated or perhaps a non-carbonated version.
16812,B001LGGH40,A3SQQYS79AV13M,Terri J. Rice ricepaper,0/0,1236124800,Refreshingly Tasty,This carbonated juice drink quenched my thirst.  The small size means you don't have to commit to a huge serving and is a fantastic size for kids who never. ever seem to finish a can of anything.<br /><br />It is 100% juice and makes a very tasty refreshing way to get a serving of fruit for the day.<br />It also has 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C and only 1% sodium.<br />I would absolutely offer this in place of soda for my children.
16818,B001LGGH40,A3C4UKEYNLUP4X,T. C Gerlach pootiboo,0/0,1236124800,We all liked it!!,As others have said this drink is 100% natural and contains none of the things that we don't want in soda.  My family really enjoyed it.  I thought it had a great bubbly and fruity taste.  None of us found it overly sweet.  We're not big soda drinkers. but this would be fun on a hot day as something different.
16828,B001LGGH40,A3OIQ3T0OIKY66,L. J. Schrader,0/0,1236038400,A Switch for the better?,I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of junk food in our home. including sodas. so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them. but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay. but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation. more natural than most traditional soda. but still just as sugary. even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore. I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid. but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough. but as my son put it I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again. Also. I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad. so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them. and don't expect it to be a great. healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs/sugar.
16829,B001LGGH40,A18D0R137EYS6C,Clinton Enlow,0/0,1235606400,The Switch Kiwi Berry,I've read a few reviews for this product complaining that it's too sweet to drink truthfully. I'm a soda drinker but I usually stay away from fruit sodas as they do tend to be sweeter to taste than say a cola or root beer. To me though The Switch billed as a healthier alternative to soda had a less sugary taste compared to something like Fanta or the like that was perfectly fine I suppose if it truthfully was healthier than soda. Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product. the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice. Then again if you really must having something billed as a healthy alternative to soda then its not bad I suppose just not something I'd be interested in personally.

This Was Not What I Was Hoping For,UPDATE: April 3. 2009<br />I ordered this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE. Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product. which as such cannot be healthy. Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I. along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration. have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day. I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly. Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas. but with a few more calories!  The diet drink I was hoping it would be. turned out to be nothing short of off the diet.  As far as I am concerned. Switch is a wolf in lamb's clothing for those who consider themselves heath conscious.<br /><br />The description. which is rhetoric at its best. states:<br /><br />The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice. bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice. with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda. and 0% of what you don't[.]<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again. based upon what they call Daily Value (DV). similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C. nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately. and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C. I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice. but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle). Coca-Cola Cherry (TR). Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as Carb above). but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients. here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES. APPLE. GRAPE. KIWI. ACEROLA. RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES). NATURAL FLAVORS. ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER. HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. CARMEL COLOR. PHOSPHORIC ACID. NATURAL FLAVORS. CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C. and used in baby foods. I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is. to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice. while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So. in the end. the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest. I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes. since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story. but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said. I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet. as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed. I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?
16908,B001LGGH40,A1BEKAQQGP8CMF,Seth R,3/4,1235433600,I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry,Right off the bat. know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar. no corn syrup. and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C. by the way). it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn't a great combination. so I had the drink by itself and it was much. much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are). so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor. so I will surely look into the other flavors available. most likely the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54>watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste. Oh. and the can is cool too - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling.
16912,B001LGGH40,AO9UNKQG83BUP,Book Fan,5/7,1235520000,Tastes like overly sweet apple juice. Trader Joe's version is better,Summary:  way too sweet. no berry/kiwi flavor. small serving.<br /><br />Upon first taste. both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally. both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute. and the first two juices are apple and grape. so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice. which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while). and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi. and is not too sweet. and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally. it is in a very stylish slim can. which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way. fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar. and this drink is full of it.  When they say no *added* sugar. that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using. which is not the same thing as saying no sugar or no sucrose (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks. so if you do. you may like this one.
16919,B001LGGH40,A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,K. Stuckey kateling,0/0,1290470400,Tasty and refreshing,I received a couple of samples of these at a food service show recently and was pretty impressed. Kiwi berry was my favorite. sweet but not too sweet and the sparkling water kicks it up. The orange tangerine was very tasty as well. I am a fan of delicious flavor. They have no added sugar. but still plenty (29 grams) of sugar that naturally occurs in the fruit concentrate the juice is made from...versus 39 grams in a can of regular Coke. My go-to juice drink is still Fruit 66. but the Switch is a very close second!
16921,B001LGGH40,A8T9EP7QKGR4T,Joyce Crowley Joyce Crowley,0/0,1264809600,NO SUGAR. NO SWEETNERS,I love this drink & I don't have to feel guilty about drinking it!!!

16924,B001LGGH40,A17OYW896EY37V,Leda's Grandma,0/0,1251676800,Switch Kiwi Berry,I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry.  I was looking for an alternative to soda and this really filled that niche for me.  This flavor was very pleasant in my opinion. but that is a personal thing that everyone will have to decide on their own.  The Switch is 100% juice so you can feel good about giving it to your family and it is carbonated so the kids will think they are getting soda. a win win situation! Although it may be a little high in sugar. that is because it is fruit juice. not because it is loaded with corn syrup etc etc.<br />I would recommend this product and feel very comfortable giving it to my grandaughter.
16926,B001LGGH40,A3IFKBUE064H5V,Nia www.altimatepublishing.com,0/0,1246233600,Overly sweet,This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes. but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor. They would be easily fooled into thinking they're are drinking soda. But for an adult it is overly sweet.

16965,B0045TNRN4,A1UWS5JHIHBMOK,Rusty181,1/1,1328313600,BEST BRAND,Smucker's is the best brand one can order for preserves.  The reason I ordered the Pineapple Preserves on line is that it is very hard to find in stores.  It has a great flavor and is quite different from other selections.
16975,B005EKWOZK,A1WPB2WEDD5HT7,Andrew Cannon,0/0,1342569600,Dissapointing Product,I have been using the earlier versions of this product for about 15 years. It was without a doubt the best tasting cheese salsa on the market. I have tried many other brands and they are not very impressive. When I saw Pace Salsa Con Queso back on the market I was very pleased until I tasted it. The flavor and consistency are disgusting compared to the Mexican Four Cheese and original versions. I have contacted Pace without results. I would be embarrassed as well.  I think I will take these cans and smash them against a brick wall. This is just one more sorry replacement for a good product.
16984,B003XUJ564,A329ECACQQQ9YE,ABBA,1/1,1346371200,YUKKY MESS - OPEN CANS! BUT GREAT SERVICE TO REPLACE THE ORDER!,The case of 12 I ordered arrived with 4 (that's 1/3!) of the cans OPEN and contents all over the mailing box. They were with other canned goods (beans). What a mess! BUT Amazon came through as they always have and replaced the entire order for no charge and mailed them with Prime-1. even tho' I am a Prime-2 customer. BTW. that $79 per year has really paid off for me because what I order is always free shipping and always arrives in 2 days. This is the first year I have had PRIME-2. and I will continue every year from now on. Also. there is the benefit of so many movies to watch for free as part of PRIME membership. Good job. Amazon!

These were dented befor they were packed in the case of 12 at the factory. These will get trashed because it will be more of a pain to return them. I will never buy these again !!! Amazon did refund my money without having me return the cans. Cudos to Amazon. They are a class act!
17002,B003XUJ564,A1TMH98ARQNC5B,Fisterkev,0/4,1330560000,Obviously factory rejects. but still fine to eat,I bought this item when it was heavily discounted (about $12) and it got here very promptly. since I am a Prime member. Every can has small dents. The discounted batch I ordered and recieved appears to consist entirely of factory rejects. They were bought 02/2012 and have a 12/2013 best by date. so not that big of a deal. None of the cans are punctured. just small dents. The contents are currently GTG.<br /><br />I'd say if you are planning on eating these within a few months to a year or so of purchase. go ahead and do it. If not. I wouldn't trust dented cans beyond their best by date. or even really too far before then.<br /><br />As for the contents. same as you buy in the store. Wife and kid love them. which is why I bought it.<br /><br />The price has more than doubled since I got mine. Perhaps I just got a reject buy... Be warned.

Not to mention the Folgers select are always a few bucks less then the other premium coffees. For some reason the selection at my local stores has dwindled and they don't have this blend. They only have the funky flavored blends. Don't know if this is from Folgers' end or Walmart's continuing limitation of product selection. Love this coffee. hope is stays around.

17085,B000NJMV14,A383XURHVF8ON6,Mrs. Kilo Delta,2/2,1280016000,Excellent grain-free treats!,These treats are the bee's knees. I've bought them in EVERY flavor they offer. Lamb liver is a great flavor. but my pups love all the flavors equally. it seems. Each treat is about 1 wide and 1 to 1-1/2 in length. Good sized treat for a bigger dog. and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties. these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs. no mess. They smell like the jerky I buy for myself. and have quality ingredients. The shelties love them! I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too. they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.  My parents' little pom-terrier mix has a special place in her heart for anything liver. so these were well received (*snarf snarf snarf*) by that pup too.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten. so I feed both furkids grain-free everything. Even if he didn't have epilepsy. I'd probably still feed grain-free. including these treats. because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way. I don't buy these treats here. I get them elsewhere. but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats. it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training. Each bag lasts me about a month. I think.
17088,B000NJMV14,A1YY3M98PYO22G,MadManMoon,0/0,1281830400,Great treats for a picky dog,These jerky treats are my dog's favorite treats.  Recently my vet stopped selling them and I panicked for a few seconds.  I had the realization: I can check Amazon!.  Truthfully.  this is the closest you can get to giving your dog jerky.  My vet is a holistic vet and I consequently don't give my dog just any treat.  Still. my tiny toy poodle is VERY particular. even to the point of knowing which flavor he wants when I hold up the bags!  I bought the lamb liver. chicken and venison and venison but he loves all of the flavors. even the fish.  I like the fact that they are all natural and I'd recommend them in a heartbeat.

17147,B003VVL8NS,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,Bob Dog My Thoughts,10/10,1286323200,Delightful Revival of an Old Favorite (if wrapper is all wrong),I definitely remember buying Turkish Taffy in all four flavors (Vanilla. Bananna. Chocolate. and yes. Strawberry) for $0.05 at our local drugstore when I was a wee lad. I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of). and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla). and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard. rounded or blunt object. such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach. or more likley. they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know. this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks. particularly the small ones. that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna. etc.). and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends. and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous. freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically. the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion. although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People. please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box). there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original. authentic foil. Really.

These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry. Raspberry Lemonade. Natural Lemonade. and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless. I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either. for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light Natural Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />Natural Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms. natural (good grief. just look at the ingredients list!). this. for my taste. is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural. it does taste remarkably like real lemonade. However. I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting. slight bad aftertaste. you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better. but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible. strong. bitter. fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah. I know. I don't have to buy it.  They don't have to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.)
17267,B000GPXRRW,A84NJWFUFNERK,Lost Lake,3/3,1287187200,No better creamer out there,I am addicted to this stuff. Price wise. I can buy this at WalMart for $3.50 a package. and using coupons I can get that down to $2.50 a bottle. So now I just buy 6 or so at WalMart when I start running low. I have bought a hundred of these and they are always in good condition with no lumps and alway filled completely. What can I say about a creamer except I love the taste!
17274,B000GPXRRW,A2R66KKV68BQ1T,fisherman,0/0,1320883200,coffee made better,I normally drink my coffee black; but I discovered this combination at a station store.  This Coffee-mate flavor works great with Torani sugar-free caramel syrup to satisfy this coffee drinker's sweet-tooth with coffee.
17292,B000EVIDUY,AV416RROMXFO9,bitcrunch,1/1,1311292800,YUM,These are the best brownies I've ever had.  Including the ones I used to make from scratch back when I could still eat wheat.<br /><br />I serve them to my family and friends all the time. they're a staple in my cabinet.  I bring them to parties. potlucks. and to work. and get compliments constantly.  No one cares that they're gluten-free. except me.
17304,B000EVIDUY,A1RCQ6WRMXE0ZN,GF Jungle,1/1,1164844800,Our favorite brownies,My husband who doesn't have to eat gluten free even loves these brownies.  He is picky and he prefers this over Pamela's.  Our 2 kids and myself have to eat gluten free and this is our favorite store bought mix for brownies.  It is very good with some vanilla ice cream.
17311,B000EVIDUY,A3VRZ95YZWQKP8,K. Millspaugh,0/0,1341878400,Brownie Mix  Gluten Free,This is. without a doubt. the best gluten free brownie product available.  For some reason. I'm having trouble finding GF Pantry products in my area so am grateful to be able to have a case shipped.  I highly recommend this product. Even my non GF friends think they are the best.
17331,B000EVIDUY,AL37D8J2SUVFW,bargainhunter,0/0,1264377600,Amazing!,These are soooooooo delicious!  I just baked these this evening and they were a huge hit.  We all agreed that they taste just as good if not better than some of the best wheat flour brownie mixes out there.  They were moist and very rich with a crunchy (but not hard. just right) top. I cut back a little on the margarine.  It calls for 7 tablespoons of butter but instead I used 4 tablespoons of Earth Balance with 3 tablespoons of applesauce.  Also. I baked them in cupcake liners because I like to freeze them and take them out as needed.  It tasted perfect this way but I can't comment on how this modification compares to the original recipe since I haven't tried it the other way.  I will be sure to stock my pantry with this mix!
17350,B000EVIDUY,A1GC7U9O6ALO4E,Suzyota,0/0,1220054400,yummmm,These are just about the most sinfully delish brownies I have ever had..I made them with applesauce substitution and no one noticed they were fat free.....gluten free pantry makes the best mixes
17372,B000H1VBNC,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,O. Brown Ms. O. Khannah-Brown,1/1,1175472000,Nice Green Tea Blend. Fine Flavor,****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea. Japanese green tea. Chinese green tea. Assam green tea. Darjeeling green tea. and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste. and doesn't appear to be as strong in its [...] effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea. even more so than green tea. containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas. White tea is not oxidized. but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still. it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea. with some extra-healthful white tea added. it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different. and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />****
17374,B000UJW0W2,A17ED9J0J0UJ9G,A. Gehlke Cat Mom,2/2,1305676800,Regret buying,When I bought this mat I initially thought it was fine but it actuality is too small and at the beginning my cats didn't like stepping on it either.  Because of it' small size. I end up with daily litter on either side of this mat.  Disappointed and now looking for a replacement that catches more of the litter.
17380,B000UJW0W2,ADZ7THBLDGHQN,Rick and Carol R and C,0/0,1344211200,Great product,My kitty is a little messy so I needed one of these. All the local pet supply stores do not carry these any more. I was happy I found this seller on Amazon.com. Mpw my rugs can continue to be saved.  Product is as advertized. Very durable. I even wash it in the washing machine on cold water. : )
17407,B000Y2LYCC,A11F2W8A8GUCZ3,Charlene M. Morgan cmorganus,0/0,1338508800,Yummy & portable!,Slips easily into bag & is a great snack on-the-run.  But be aware. it contains two servings & plan accordingly.  Love the Auto Ship & it gets cheaper the longer you stay with it!  Good deal!
17421,B0045Z6K50,A3NPDCU412WIN9,angieP,0/0,1323820800,favorite k-cup,Newman's own K-cups are the best i have tasted in about a year and a half of owning a Keurig. They brew strong but not bitter and don't  have the plastic/chemical taste of some k-cup blends. Great product.
17437,B0045Z6K50,A2A19HW9BQAL4R,Janet Gibson,0/0,1316908800,Newman's Own,This was the first time I ordered K Cups from Amazon. arrived quickly and I really liked the Medium roast Organic Blend By Newman. I liked the Decaf also and will drink it but only if I do not have Timothy's decaf I liked it better. jgibson
17443,B0045Z6K50,A2BXD9E5I6L3D4,Jefe,0/0,1313798400,Excellent but pricey,This one is really tasty. well blended. flavorful; all in all a great choice. Just a little too pricey for my blood. so I've moved to the coffee people brand. However. I don't think anyone will be disappointed in the cup of coffee these k cups make.
17463,B0045Z6K50,A1RUKBP9U9NEHK,Cal Bear,0/1,1334016000,Flavor stays in my mouth... waaaay after drinking it,I know this is a weird review. but the fact that I noticed it enough to write about it means I'm not making it up. I just went through a Costco sized box of Tully's bold. and that was great. So I decided to try this box. The main thing I noticed is that I have to scrub the hell out of my mouth and tongue after drinking it. because the flavor really. really stays around. I never noticed having to do this with Tully's. It's a gross. smoky taste. It's like having smoker's breath without smoking.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish this box...
17486,B0045Z6K50,A10PEXB6XAQ5XF,Michael Gallagher,3/3,1301356800,Good Cup of Morning Joe,If you're looking for what I consider a true bold cup of coffee. I think you are going to be disappointed and may want to try <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ>Emerils Gourmet Coffee. Emeril's Big Easy Bold. K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>. but this one does just fine for me with no bitter aftertaste.  I enjoy this one more so than most breakfast blends. and if you like this kind of coffee you might. too.<br /><br />To put it in perspective. I seem to alternate between the bold and what I consider a regular cup of coffee with <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ>Emerils Gourmet Coffee. Emeril's Big Easy Bold. K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>. <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y>Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) for Keurig Brewers. 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>. <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y>Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) for Keurig Brewers. 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>. and (believe it or not) <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK>Coffee People. Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>.  Divergent. yes. but alternating between different levels of taste depending upon the time of day (or attitude. I guess).<br /><br />Bottom line is if you enjoy any of the other brands I mention above. give this one a try - I don't think you will be disappointed.
17490,B0045Z6K50,A3D9IQGX9A88RM,Joshua,1/1,1342742400,This is the only K Cup we buy!,As far as Keurig coffee goes. you have like. a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong. smooth coffee. you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold. for me. is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word strong or dark etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup. you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning. and it wakes me up.  I brew it in the afternoon. and it gives me that last-half-of-the-day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.  If you like strong coffee. you won't be disappointed!
17497,B0045Z6K50,A3T5S5CEEBMVTT,Michael J. Craveiro Mike,1/1,1330473600,Definitely not my favorite,I have tried quite a few K-Cup products and this one left me longing for something else. It kind of has a burnt taste to it. I have tried Newman's coffee via a McDonald's and it did not taste like this. Overall I was disappointed and have moved on to the likes of Wolfgang Puck. These tend to be a little more smooth.
17504,B0045Z6K50,A1KET8O1NAW8MW,Charles Pompe,1/1,1323302400,Good. Not great,Good flavor and bold accents.  Very good but just doesn't<br />Grab me. I tend to rprefer very bold and strong coffee.
17509,B0045Z6K50,A2RO3TAQZ08G5U,Peg,2/3,1281484800,Woulda Shoulda Coulda,I shoula bought it at Costco for much less and next time I will.  Everything else. the product. the delivery. etc was top rated as usual.
17512,B0045Z6K50,A220R3YGCKPTBH,Anthony Stevens,0/0,1350691200,not too strong not too weak,What can I say except the coffee is not too strong and not too weak. No Bitterness. Overall a pleasant indulgence. Strong enough to stand up to plain or flavored creamers. Have tried a wide variety of brands now and this is one of my favorites. Another favorite is Sumatran Reserve.
17514,B0045Z6K50,A38WPIU8HZDZ,T. Allen,0/0,1350345600,Newmans own,Excellent coffee. Good flavor and the 80 count is the best value for you money. Definitely recommend it if you're not a fan of weak coffee
17536,B0045Z6K50,ATCLGTOJ402R5,LAK,0/0,1335571200,I agree,I agree with San Diego.  I return to Newman's Own time after time after trying several others (and there are some other good ones out there. Deidrich's being one). As for Sam's Club. yes. Newman's is less expensive there. but we now live two-three hours to the nearest store. so Amazon is a good second choice as I would spend the difference in gas alone.
17544,B0045Z6K50,A4XF0Z4VW0QBP,jimmygoroar,0/0,1333411200,my favorite kcup option,this is hands down my favorite kcup option out there.  not too mild. not too bold. a nice solid body to this coffee.  cheaper here than you can find at the store. and has arrived without issue everytime i order another box.
17553,B000CMIYWM,A2RJSDN6FXLMAL,Manu Singh,5/5,1337472000,Inaccurate Product Description,This product says that it contains Kava Kava to help with it's calm tea. but there is no Kava in it.  This is confirmed by the tea box set as well as Yogi Tea website.  I just thought I would make anyone else aware in case they were looking for a little supplemental Kava for their tea. but don't want the other Yogi tea with Kava in it.
17561,B000CMIYWM,A2F126HIJSE436,G. Kalb,0/0,1339286400,Tastes good. is healthy. and reasonably priced!,Excellent tea for the money. Love the taste and it's all organic. Makes excellent ice tea as well. Try their other flavors too. they are just as good.
17574,B0000GH6UQ,AS3VBCEIICR0E,B. Barrie,1/1,1297209600,yum,A friend. who grew up in El Salvador. made some hot chocolate one night.  We all wanted know what ingredients he'd used - we loved the drink!  This was not the Quik of childhood.<br />I pop a piece into a large mug of skim milk - into the microwave for a bit/'til heated through.  Mix w/ a small egg whisk and enjoy.
17576,B0000GH6UQ,A23JODKYLWHBKE,Benjamin C. Auerbach OnigiriMarathon,2/3,1173312000,A different kind of hot chocolate,When it came to hot chocolate my beverage used to be swiss miss.  But after one cold morning of moving a hot tub I was rewarded with Abuelita.  This hot cocoa has tastes of cinnamon and other spices.  I like to add a bit of cayenne or chili powder to it. and it is just delicious.
17577,B0000GH6UQ,A3QWCUA9PHJ1D0,Jimmianne,0/0,1348012800,Not Good,I found this product disappointing. It did not dissolve quickly and left a gritty residue. It is very high in sugar - almost 70 grams per tab and has saturated fat listed as one of the ingredients.
17578,B0000GH6UQ,A3F159CDZM6Y2P,Erin Robinson,0/0,1328745600,Excellent chocolate.,I have never used this to make a hot chocolate drink. but it is my favorite chocolate to use in cookies.  Chopped into chunks and mixed in the dough. it stands in for normal chocolate chips beautifully.  The slightly grainy texture comes through the baking perfectly intact and creates a wonderful contrast with the chewy cookie.  Try it!  It's wonderful.
17585,B0000GH6UQ,A3BQ9SJGD2B2S2,Matthew Menard,1/2,1229558400,Quicker Mexican Hot Chocolate,I have been making hot chocolate w Abuelita for years. I have found that if I heat a tablet(in its paper) in the microwave. i can spoon in a softer mostly melted mix that does not require a blender or diminish the flavor. You may want to start at about 30 secs and warm more as needed.
17598,B000U9YQ56,AM995K8543MCO,Shannon,0/0,1319932800,nice,i love the taste of lavender but if you use to much it can be soapy tasting and thats just really bad..
17626,B000CMIYWC,A2K90J2GLB0B8D,Michael Michaud,1/6,1259625600,Packaging problems,I have been drinking the tea for about a year now. The product is fine.<br />My complaint is with the recent change on the individual tea bag envelope.<br />The new lavendar colored envelopes are impossible to open without the aid of scissors (or my teeth).<br />The previous two-tone envelopes tore open easily.<br />Please revert back.
17638,B000IHXML4,A2Z9VE09ZBS4YE,trevor,0/0,1286409600,not good enough,i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. THis bone was not the solution. There is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. I threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again.
17660,B000PHHW22,A3SYTS2ULA5O24,Scarlett Witherall The Princess,1/1,1331251200,Cute.,Not the best quality. a few pieces seemed to be slighly out dated. Overall though. it was a good buy. Most of the pieces were fresh and it brought back some memories and that to me is what really made this a great value. The two ladies that recieved this thought it was great. and told me stories about the fourties that made me laugh. so I would suggest this if you are looking to give it as a gift to someone in say their seventies or eighties like I did.
17672,B002Z04RNY,AM3NMEX2NSXZO,Kai Tubbs Kai,0/0,1274227200,5 Stars and Six thumbs up,Purchased these for my neice and she loves them four big thumbs and two little ones up and a big ol' smile of approval. These are a great treat for any child (even the picky ones)
17704,B000R32F6M,A14EK7CK43XIIE,YS Sheu ss,0/1,1317081600,It has a nice vanilla aroma,It smells good. tastes like black tea. and it is decaffeinated.  I didn't really taste the creamy sweet flavor of vanilla.  In other words. the tea tastes like normal black tea if not for the vanilla aroma.  I think I'll go back to green tea based tea.
17709,B0051OQ23E,A1LBU1GH9H5F0P,Y. Fung ambivalence,3/3,1120176000,Best cookie in the world!,If you love the taste of caramel and the crisp crunch of a thin cookie that doesn't fill you up. there's no better alternative. I can eat this all day!
17714,B003YBJ9JA,A3KK9KN5EJUN92,stlmommy09,0/0,1311206400,My daughter loves it,I bought this at a store in the area to see if my daughter would like it. not only does she like it. she LOVES it.  She has already drank alot of the bottle.  I'm so happy that she likes since its veggies and juice in one cup.  The reason for leaving this review is because I am on Amazon looking for juice in bulk to see if its cheaper.
17752,B000Z978SS,A3L5SK2RX2JBEE,STEPHEN E. DUBUIS Stephen E. du Buis,2/3,1317081600,Sweet like sugar. just less so.,I like this product because it tastes just like sugar.  It is non-clumping so it flows very freely.  It doesn't attract water like sugar does so it stays dry even in very humid air.  Some have said that it has a cooling effect like xylitol. which is sometimes undesirable. but if it does. it is very mild to the point that I was not able to perceive it.  To my taste. it is about a half as sweet as sugar so it takes more but I've detected no digestive upset whatsoever. which is not true for many other sugar substitutes.
17772,B001EQ4LAE,A2UZI6M8HAZRMH,imalemur221,0/0,1286841600,Great brownie mix!,My daughter is a celiac and cannot have any gluten.  This is an easy to use mix that taste great!  Especially warm with a scoop of ice cream on top!

17836,B0001FQVCA,A2FOV3T02SWT80,Tom&Jen,1/1,1316995200,Nutella -Happiness in a plastic jar.,This review may sound immature. possibly overly dramatic.  this is the only product review I have ever written. normally read them but dont write them.  For this product though - it is different.  It is an absolute privledge to write a review for Nutella.  It is the best thing I have ever tasted - no joke.  Nutella is happiness in a plastic jar.
17845,B0001FQVCA,A13VUTTS8FX006,Sadie,0/0,1342310400,Delicious,Perfect for crepes! It's not a peanut butter taste- it's actually hazelnut which is more delicious. We put on bread for breakfast.
17849,B0001FQVCA,A1J65EXRZ14U0U,Timothy Driskell,0/0,1303603200,love it,I eat Nutella almost every morning. I love and my kids love it. It seems to go well with most things. YUMMY!
17854,B004CHAAGG,A14SRQG83SQ80C,Robert E. Lawler,0/0,1334016000,Candy,Received this purchased boxed of 5lbs of candy within just a few days or ordering it on-line.<br />The price was exceptional compared to THE VERMONT STORE.<br />They had the very same candy. but. sold for much more and it was just 2.5lbs NOT 5lbs.
17855,B004L5EVSC,A2C6XWQQIPXB6B,BDubb Bweir,0/0,1343606400,Monin Blackberry Sangria,Thank You for all the info on the product.I was looking all over the place trying to find a place that had Blackberry Sangria. Amazon was the only one who carried it. It makes a great drink Thanks again.
17868,B001SB60UO,A3K8MOJPD6WRBD,Vickie L. Thornton,0/0,1346371200,Seal Sama. Sugar free Teriyaki sause,I love this product.  Being sugar free is wonderful and best of all. it is thick and taste very good.  I have used it over all the veggies both in cooking and freshly steamed.  I could use any product as I don't have a medical necessity - but I use it because of the high quality and taste above all other things I have tried.  Saving sugar calories is a bonus.  Also it is so convenient to just look it up on Amazon and order it without fear of who is handling the deal or any reprisal there after.<br />If you haven't tried it - give it a try - it makes the veggies oh so good - lol
17870,B001EO653M,A1L1KN09U55WBC,saad,4/4,1320969600,Info,There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate. I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag. other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet.
17876,B001EO653M,A6SM104267C1C,C. J. Postelli The Good Aunt,2/2,1257638400,Great Hot Chocolate w/a bit of spice,This makes an excellent hot chocolate.  I also make my own gourmet hot chocolate mix and I use a bit of this to kick up some of the mix.
17878,B001EO653M,A2HTJPKXV4VWP6,A Reader,1/1,1230940800,Yum. yum.,This is. hands down. the absolute best hot chocolate ever. First had it years ago in a little cafe in Va. Have been ordering it online ever since. Have also given it to friends & family as a gift and everyone raves about it. A wonderful taste of chocolate mixed with just the right spices. Try it once and you'll be hooked.
17881,B001EO653M,AEC521J743EDT,Annie Lastar,2/3,1251417600,A taste of chocolate heaven,A wonderful taste surprise that has spoiled me for all other hot chocolate drinks there ever were.<br />MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a rich. creamy. spice surprise that is not your mama's hot chocolate. If you are a hot chocolate drinker don't miss this.
17888,B001EO653M,A2FYZZ7V6B2EOF,mudewsa,0/0,1330905600,my relaxation,i love this spicy chocolate. it's perfect for anytime. the best way to make it. is to heat your milk on the stove and add the chocolate as it is warming. i also add some whipped cream to my cup with a sprinkle of chili powder on the top. love to curl up and just relax with a warm cup.
17916,B001EO653M,A3HK2RRJHLYVA2,Jennifer B. Smith,2/4,1220659200,Yummy Mocafe,I found this product in a coffee shop in Chincoteague. VA  And was blown away by it's taste.  Energizing. but not too over the top.  And I received it quickly.
17924,B008ZRKZSM,A2LM6EH3UWCNQC,victoria bell,1/1,1341014400,Yay! I &lt;3 Peanut Butter. and now I can actually have it!,So... my preferred breakfast is 9 or 12 grain toast with peanut butter. But at the end of the week that's a LOT of calories and fat. So I started having cereal or oatmeal and I started losing some of the 10 pounds or so that I've put on in the last couple of years.<br />No matter how much I exercised or ate carefully. that peanut butter was doing me in.  Now I mix a bit of PB2 every morning and save hundreds of calories per week-- and I still get to have my preferred breakfast.<br />The taste? Not going to lie- it isn't exactly the same. But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore-- just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute-- long enough for my bread to be toasted- so no big deal.<br />I'm lazy and always hungry-- but this absolutely works for me.<br />I'm so delighted to have discovered it.
17925,B008ZRKZSM,A2KJ5E4L1877OY,Elizabeth Perez,1/1,1340755200,PB2 is Amazing!!,PB2 is amazing!!! I was a little worried about trying it and I must say I was so pleasantly surprised. We have been using it every night in smoothies (peanut butter/banana) and it is so good. I've even tried it on a sandwich. The taste is pleasant. It tastes more like an actual peanut. I would definately recommend.
17929,B008ZRKZSM,A3V5JGFSR6IXAD,CF Loser,1/1,1338681600,Chocolate peanut butter shake,I love this stuff!  I put it in a chocolate protein mix and voila! Chocolate peanut butter shake!  I also is great with a banana thrown in.
17936,B008ZRKZSM,ARJE4G6E9L83J,Leslie P. Peebles,1/1,1334275200,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!,I am a peanut butter lover. but not a fan of the high calories and fat. As an extreme health junkie. I understand the notion behind moderation. but I admit that it's a bit hard to obey when it comes to peanut butter. Because of this. I haven't eaten peanut butter in a long time (about 3 years!)<br /><br />About 2 months ago. PB2 entered my life and I could NOT have been any happier with this product. It's so amazingly yummy and perfect! I use it in powder form for my smoothies or I add water and some cinnamon and use it as a spread for crackers. I also use it for other foods like my baked tofu or sauteed shrimp. I love that you can adjust the consistency depending on the amount of water you add. Sometimes I can make it really thick by adding a little bit of water or more smooth with more water. I love that flexibility. I will be using this product for the rest of my life. as long as its still in production!
17937,B008ZRKZSM,A2LZ0V0MS6XQYI,stacyo,1/1,1334188800,I really wanted to love this product...,I was so hopeful that _finally_ a lower fat. great tasting peanut butter was available. But when it arrived it was a huge let down. Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately. it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok. the color a little pale. but all that aside. the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried.
17940,B008ZRKZSM,A3L5J6A4EIT2YV,Soher Susu Morsi,1/1,1333238400,For the health conscious peanut butter lovers!,Excellent product! I use it to make smoothies & peanut sauce for my Asian inspired dishes! I highly recommend this as a healthy alternative to regular peanut butter. The only downfall. it's a bit pricey. However. well worth it.
17941,B008ZRKZSM,A1L5Z1PAO859G6,Jolynn,1/1,1332374400,SUPER FOR WEIGHT LOSS,I have always wanted peanut butter to have alot less calories. I LOVE peanut butter and this tastes GREAT and I'm helping my weight loss at the same time. I  think this is super and anyone wanting to try this you should.
17944,B008ZRKZSM,A2YWQAFCHIO779,VR33,1/1,1329955200,Worth a try!,From reading all the amazing reviews. I expected it to taste better than it did. I love regular peanut butter. so I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. I think if you manage your expectations about taste. this is a good purchase to ease your PB tooth! It works best mixed with some regular PB and in recipes (versus eating it plain or on a sandwich). Def worth a try!
17960,B008ZRKZSM,AG6GL0Q8EWZ6Q,Memawh MemawH,1/1,1322179200,Great Product,Wasn't sure how easy this product would be to locate. was so happy to find it at Amazon. This is a delicious product great for smoothies or sandwiches. the taste is amazingly smooth and peanutty great texture. I would highly recommend it for people like myself that is watching their calories and salt and sugar intake. Amazon is an excellent resource for hard to find products and their service is outstanding.
17961,B008ZRKZSM,AAJBGQ91IX2RL,Robert  Mulcahy,1/1,1322179200,Baking,Used this product for baking. Finally could make great tasting peanut butter recipes with out all the fat & calories.
17964,B008ZRKZSM,A35K8CMK6B8IZ8,Randibeth,1/1,1321315200,perfect sub for high cal peanut butter,i LOVE peanut butter but my waistline does not ; )<br />when i heard about this i ordered a bunch immediately.  it is really good and i don't think i'll go back to regular pb ever!!  will be buying again and again
17965,B008ZRKZSM,A32GD054S1RR2T,Lisa C. Chasse,1/1,1321228800,My opinion,I love the product. It really taste awesome on toast. I am thrilled it is all natural. I brought some to school and had all the teachers try this for lunch in the teachers room. It was a huge hit.
17978,B008ZRKZSM,A12Z9EGP870AI5,Dee,1/1,1314921600,No more feeling guilty,I am on Weight Watchers and I love peanut butter.  Now. I can have more of it without feeling guilty because there is virtually no fat in this product.  Tastes better than the regular stuff too.  Amazing!
17999,B008ZRKZSM,AOFMKFQLJCAK9,Reader,1/1,1266796800,PB2,I love this product.  If you love PB but never purchase a jar because you could eat an entire jar in a day or 2. this product is for you.  I loved FitzNuts PB until I bought PB2.  It is superior.  I have it on apples or cabbage.  I don't overeat it because you have to mix it up - takes seconds - with water.  I have even used it in recipes that call for 1/4 cup PB.  It works fine.<br />Just remember. it is not PB.  If you are a die-hard PB Connoisseur. this may not be for you but if you love PB but want something with less calories and fat. PB2 is for you!
18017,B008ZRKZSM,A1FFZLT663X7OO,Kim,0/0,1348012800,Great in protein shakes!,I added this to my <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WLY4L8>Sun Warrior Warrior Blend Raw Plant-Based Complete Protein Powder ~ Vanilla ~ 2.2 lbs Bag</a> protein shake. and it is amazing!  Has *almost* a Reeses Peanut Butter cup taste.  Highly recommended!
18023,B008ZRKZSM,A21QS27OBPVWTL,Jason,58/59,1294099200,Excellent. except for Amazon's pricing mistake.,Excellent. mixes well in a protein shake and tastes just like a jar of peanut butter!<br />The only problem with ordering it from Amazon is they have an obvious pricing mistake. I can get this from other websites for $3.99 a jar. even if your an amazon prime member and get free shipping here. you will still save a lot ordering it elsewhere.<br />You can even get it from the manufactures website for much cheaper.<br />I called the company and the suggested retail price is approx. $4.00 per jar.
18044,B008ZRKZSM,A363C53T0YCN1Q,prettyface,0/0,1343865600,Guiltless,I really like the flavor. not exactly like real peanut butter but still tasty. And I don't feel bad about eating it like I do when I eat 10 grams of fat on regular peanut butter. I do agree with the previous review. price is high especially since it doesn't last as long as the regular PB. Although there always seems to be a higher price on unique products like this one. I bought both the original PB and Chocolate PB. I like original better. I'll buy it again.
18068,B008ZRKZSM,A30627EVT9WEF8,Beth B,0/0,1339632000,Amazing,I am amazed at this product.  I didn't really expect it to be as good as it is.  Now. if they could only come up with a way for it to be crunchy. it would be perfect!  It's good as is (blended with water) and also as an addition to recipes calling for peanut butter.  This is an excellent product and a great way to enjoy peanut butter without the fat.
18085,B008ZRKZSM,A2HDK6H1UDXASX,Olga Figueroa,0/0,1335139200,Love the lowfat peanut butter,I really love this product!  It taste so good without all the fat and heart burn.  I like to mix it with strawberry jelly. equal parts and spread on my toast.  It has only 1.5 g of fat while peanut butter has 17g/ serving.  It is a guilty pleasure with little fat and calories.
18104,B008ZRKZSM,A2TRQJOOXP89J2,Joanne M. Barrett,0/0,1328918400,Just like peanut butter,I love the product I use it over my Frozen Yocurt for a lower cal. desert.  Also have made chocolate candie with no cal. with some and cocoa  Very Yummy
18106,B008ZRKZSM,A11W06IKQ8WMM1,Mrs. Olsen,0/0,1328572800,You can't taste the difference in smoothies!,This is my new favorite product!  I make smoothies with vanilla flavored almond milk. 1/2 banana. peanut butter. and chocolate Amazing Meal <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038B1ET4>Amazing Grass Amazing Meal. Organic Chocolate Infusion Powder. Gluten Free. 10-Count Box</a>.  Today. I used PB2 instead of regular peanut butter and my smoothie tasted exactly the same!<br /><br />This is a great way to add peanut butter flavor without all the fat and calories.
18126,B008ZRKZSM,A1Y5T06R1UARCP,Robert Cooper,0/0,1325721600,Great taste and texture!,This is by far the best choice for a low fat option for peanut butter. The idea of a powdered PB seems odd at first. but once reconstituted with water. it actually has creamy texture. Tastewise. I prefer this over any other natural PB on the market.
18135,B008ZRKZSM,A3I8UA8E4R4P37,J. Martin,11/13,1329955200,It tasted like salted play doh,I usually never give bad reviews to products but this is so bad. I have peanut butter daily. I love it so much. I got this to mix into smoothies but it is far too salty to use that way. It taste nothing like peanut butter. It is just gross.
18142,B008ZRKZSM,A1ESBBJ4UFMWY7,letsgoblue,1/2,1320451200,Pretty good,This product is not ready to use.  If you're willing to mix it up each time. it's a decent product.  The peanut butter taste is solid - it's just missing the fat. My 15 year old son doesn't notice the difference at all when it's in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. and he doesn't seem to miss the fat.  He eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch and switched to PB2 at the suggestion of a nutritionist.  He lost half a pound a week since he switched. obviously combined with an overall healthy diet.  I recommend it for kids. not sure if adults will be fooled.
18143,B008ZRKZSM,A1KCULTG8DPCJ5,sigandann,1/2,1319846400,PB2,Oh my goodness!!! This is the best!!! It has passed all the tastes tests in our house and beyond.

18157,B008ZRKZSM,AYQXVKGCQ1L1Z,Joanne,7/35,1252886400,this stuff is nasty!,someone gave me the jar of PB2.  I thought it was awful...yuck.  thank goodness I didn't actually pay money for it.  It was nasty!!
18170,B008ZRKZSM,A11YOTONCPRQ9S,SH,3/3,1313452800,Way. way overpriced!,This is available at nearly every gas station gift store throughout Georgia for $3.99.  I buy it at Plantation House gas station.  Plenty of others sell it too.
18195,B008ZRKZSM,A1I6O6YH6TFVID,Alison,2/2,1321833600,Powdered peanut butter,PB2 turned out to be a pretty good alternative to peanut butter. Although its definitely not as sweet it still tastes good on PB and jelly sandwiches and overall I thought it was pretty good. Its no Jiff. but if you are trying to cut back on calories it's a great substitute.
18197,B008ZRKZSM,AWJ1HL1NB63F2,Kiki,2/2,1320451200,PB2 terrific for Weight Watchers,I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established. Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show. I was curious. ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water. the recommended serving is 1 point. regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in. the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter. thanks to whom ever developed this product.for someone like myself. trying to get healthier.well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me. and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories. GO FOR IT.
18198,B008ZRKZSM,AWQYVSJGDYMH,Brian Hill,2/2,1319500800,Awesome product. just wish it were cheaper,It's really hard to believe how good this tastes for just 45 calories. To put that into perspective. 3 Tbsp of normal peanut butter is ~ 280 calories. The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...]. and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.<br /><br />The only downside to it. if there is one. is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime. that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving. which is pretty steep for peanut butter. However. if you are on a diet. this is a very calorically efficient way to get some solid flavor and a few grams of decent quality protein.
18200,B008ZRKZSM,A2X5ILPZADJX6A,S. Thompson,2/2,1318896000,Impressed so far,Just mixed this with water to create a paste to put on celery.  Very good substitute for regular peanut butter!  Love getting a nutty taste without all those fat calories!
18219,B008ZRKZSM,AV0OB90U6I1QQ,Barbara B. Williams,2/2,1273104000,had to doctor it up a bit but now I love it,When I 1st tried this. I really didn't like it just by itself. But then in stead of putting just all water. I put 1tsp of sugar free coffee syrup and 2tsp of water and it made it taste so much better. This stuff is wonderful to add to recipes with out adding a ton of fat. Great stuff!<br />An additional note: you can buy it cheaper at bellplantation.com
18220,B008ZRKZSM,A1LW5P8Q1QHQWN,Derek E. Smith,2/2,1271721600,Great Stuff,I've used this powder for a few years now. It is great in smoothies and protein shakes. I've mixed it w/water and used it on toast. sandwiches and graham crackers. It's worth the try if you are a PB lover but want to save the fat/calories.<br />FYI: Bell Plantation also sells a Chocolate PB2 but I don't like the flavor of it at all.
18233,B001VNP4A6,A3RQDGQS9UH4Z5,KR,2/2,1339804800,BUG INFESTED,This product had live insect larva inside the nuts.  The nuts broke to pieces when squeezed with the fingers.  I do not recommend this product.  I have filed a claim for my refund as Frontier has not returned my messages.
18242,B001VNP4A6,A1R06BFDS1P5HV,M. Payne,0/0,1315094400,Terrific Bargain,I've wanted to buy whole nutmeg ever since I saw Rachel Ray using it.  I never even knew nutmeg came like this!  After seeing it at our bulk health store for $27per pound. I decided I was not going to be grinding fresh nutmeg;-) Amazon to the rescue.  Same product- half the cost.  Happy consumer!
18243,B003O5QMPK,A295DH2AFUOQL1,Tea_Lover,1/1,1286236800,Black Tea with a great Apricot taste,If you like me wear and drink black. then this tea is for you. I for the most part keep cautions of fruity teas. I like my tea solid and strong. However this tea had this boldness with a twist of Apricot. which I enjoyed. It is great to break-up a routine of always just black and have some additional flavor to it. and this tea is the one.
18265,B000SATIGO,A1Q1GVY7XA4XO7,Paul Brazelton,5/5,1285545600,Acceptable for tea. excellent for kombucha,This is a good tea. for an incredible price.  However. unless you drink tea on a daily basis. it is probably not what you're looking for.  It comes in a very large quantity that will not stay fresh forever.<br /><br />That said. I brew kombucha in five gallon batches.  This tea makes an excellent kombucha. and I use it quickly enough to justify the quantity.
18270,B000SATIGO,A3CPX9XWN4ZAFK,wefishallday,3/3,1327363200,DELICIOUS,Just received and made last night.  Very good tasting.<br />This 16oz bag is a lot of tea - more than I thought. Glad I have though.<br />Nice packaging -- but will put in tins because of the amount to keep it fresh longer.
18275,B000SATIGO,A2YJBKIPMFOZ8G,Alaska Guy,1/1,1323216000,Always Great Tea,This tea is a very great substitute for coffee. I found it about five years ago as a recommendation from a friend and have been drinking it since. It has a great flavor and versatility. I like mine strong with a couple teaspoons of honey. organic sugar is great as well. It makes a good cup of iced tea and it does get milky when cold so just be aware of that. I recommend this tea to most anyone. If you have this first thing in the morning. be sure to eat something with it.
18293,B000SATIGO,A3ATZGRMWXXV3Q,Brian B. James BrianJ,1/2,1313020800,Very weak. not what one would expect from Assam.,Quote Assam tea is known for its body. briskness. malty flavor. and strong. bright color.<br /><br />This offering is pretty abysmal. it is lacking in every department. maybe it was mislabeled. I am not sure what I am going to do with it!!
18294,B000SATIGO,A2VBJCXA84E2V2,Junebug,1/2,1294358400,Delicious and malty,I love this tea. Full bodied and malty. The packaging has a ziploc top to keep it fresh. Very nice tea for a heavy tea drinker.

18342,B0053T1688,A2WMTMNHWTYXMI,"Cherie Miller Wisdom Creek Press, LLC",0/0,1313884800,My Maggie Lives for Her Treatie-Time,My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening. after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime. it turns into Treatie-Time. Both of my girls. Lucille and Maggie. are allowed two treats. or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to earn their treatie. but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health. as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies. etc. Therefore. I've explored using organic treats. and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the girls were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore. when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters. I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past. but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats. but if the girls don't eat them. it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition. I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters. one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps. I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important. especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my grand-dog Dutchy. the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet. which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon. I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like. instead of a biscuit. And. I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break. but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two. that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces. which seems pricey. But. since it's a luxury item. I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats. especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their treatie-time.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!

I'm the only one who uses it. so the two boxes last a long time. and I'm almost out. so I just ordered more. I have other sea salts for other uses. I just realized lately that this one makes an awesome salt to coat the rim of my margarita glass....also healthy. made with organic fruit juices and 100% agave tequila. Life is good :)
18409,B001XVW3DC,A5FAD44S8EFW7,Mosan,1/1,1283299200,Maldon Salt Rocks!,OK. we tend to think salt is salt is salt. however. I had the great fortune to go to a wonderful restaurant in Barcelona. called Osmosis (check it out if you are in BCN and reserve a table. you won't regret it); as a starter. we were given Catalan bread with a local olive oil and three different types of salt - Baltic. Australian and Maldon.  Maldon was the fave of all of three of us - it has an amazing balance and you don't feel you've consumed too much salt. which couldn't be said for the other salts we sampled. I'm buying this 'coz my teenage daughter. who was at the restaurant with me. enjoyed the salt so much (and we are a virtually salt-free family) she feels we need to have this as a staple in our home!

The plants look fine. but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die. and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead!
18495,B000LKTSZM,AFQRD8UY20DJ7,amdg,1/1,1311811200,Disappointingly thick and crunchy,What I like about wafers is the lightweight effect. Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers. with many exceedingly thin layers. however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition. the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air. so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor. they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either. so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again.

18548,B002OFTFVY,A2R43ZD4FPKFIW,J. Giese Sasuke619,0/0,1339200000,Fantastic cleansing tea!,There are a number of health benefits with cleansing teas. I was reading recently about how effective lemon was for cleansing as well. so I did a search and found this tea on Amazon.com. Tastes SOOOO much better than the traditional cleansing tea sold by this company. I would highly recommend as it is healthy. and tastes great with a little honey! Give it a shot. it is worth it.
18549,B002OFTFVY,A2TKKLZTJV4NLV,A. Fisher,2/5,1300320000,Worst taste ever!,This detox tea tastes so bad that I had to force it down! I thought that it would be a good thing to do a natural detox. but I could hardly get through one box. and had to gulp it down quickly to try to not taste or smell it. It also stained my teeth! I would NEVER take this tea again!
18551,B003AK1IPI,A2NUQ4IFZ6SVNS,I. Gale,0/0,1268092800,Great for gifts and for use in your own kitchen!,I purchased a set of these salts to give as holiday gifts last year.  Everyone who received one of the blends continues to rave about it!  One evening a friend of mine brought over a black bean dip that she made from the recipe on the Artistic Taste website. it was absolutely delicious! After that. I ended up buying a set of the salts for my own kitchen.  Being a vegetarian. I am always looking for creative ways to enhance the flavor of the food I cook - mostly so my meat loving friends will stop complaining :-).  These salts really bring out the flavor of my food!
18557,B003ANJ9SI,A1J703O1VVLZE3,N. Johnson,6/6,1257984000,Great for sensitive systems,When we got my dog. she barely ate. She didn't even like treats. We finally got her to eat. but the regular (more affordable) brands didn't sit well with her system. My vet recommended this or to cook her food on our own. Obviously. cooking food for a dog gets a bit time-consuming. but this Pinnacle food really was great for my dog. She finally started to gain weight. (She was so skinny when we got her from the shelter.)<br /><br />My dog doesn't seem to have the farting problem the other reviewer said.<br /><br />I guess every dog's system is different and you just have to find the one that's right for your dog. this one works great for ours :)
18560,B003ANJ9SI,A2EWHU3RB2Z3YR,Kay,1/1,1335052800,My picky dog enjoys eating it,My dog. a Great Pyrenees. has a few food allergies (rice. chicken. eggs. soy. nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and. after a few months. he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime. it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.
18575,B002UL6M0E,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,L. M. Keefer,4/4,1322006400,Great Gift for the Holidays,I love giving and receiving these Lindor Truffles Assorted Gift Boxes for the holidays.  They are delicious. bite-sized gourmet chocolates that are individually wrapped.  The wrapping looks like miniature gifts with the sparkly and festive colors that look pretty around the holidays.  They look almost like miniature Christmas tree bulbs.  With the assorted flavors. everyone can find one they like at least.  And it's fun to sample the different flavors.  Dark chocolate truffles are included and everyone knows now that dark chocolate is good for you.  (Chocolate is a vegetable. after all--chocolate is a bean.) These seem to have popular appeal--even my sons and their friends like them. The host/hostess can put these out for a party. and save some for their family.  They keep well in the wrapping and are a perfect after-dinner mini dessert.  I find one is enough for a tasty treat.  If you like chocolate. you should enjoy these bite-sized chocolate treats.
18576,B002UL6M0E,A2WZXTSX9IS0OJ,109,2/2,1329350400,Product Looks Cheap (Not Like Picture!),I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend's family in December. I was meeting them for the first time over New Year's. Presentation matters for things like that! I thought it would make an elegant. classical gift; the picture looks all elegant. prettily-packed with a  bow.<br /><br />Well. the box I received looked nothing like the box in the picture. It came in a cheap-looking blue cardboard box with the same inside wrapping you'd find in a McDonald's toy. Worst of all. some of the candies had jack-o-lantern wrapping. That's fine in October. but by New Year's. it looks like old Halloween candy! I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.<br /><br />If you're ordering the box for yourself. by all means. go for it. The quality of the candies is just fine. But if you're ordering it to give as a gift. watch out! I think they just ship you the oldest (sometimes out-of-season) box they have. Together with cheap packaging. it makes even this expensive gift look careless.
18577,B002UL6M0E,A6IC0EZ95IFPW,Marge,2/2,1315872000,O M G !!!!!!!,If you like chocolate.....this is the only way to go.  The best chocolate in all  kinds of flavors.  The soft insides are to die for.  Love. love. love them.  I wouldnt buy them in the dead of summer tho.  The package comes with a small ice pack but it's barely enough to keep them from  melting in excessive heat.  Prices are good too.

18648,B00008JOL0,A3R9XUPGNQBAYO,Jane's Place,1/1,1341446400,I love these!,My dogs love the flavor of these.  I have tried both the chicken and peanut butter and they go nuts.  Though I will admit the peanut butter has a less-intense smell than the chicken for human noses.  I can see the difference in the dogs' coats almost immediately!  I highly recommend any Zuke's products.
18649,B00008JOL0,A3CSMZHHBRR78G,Rayray,1/1,1340841600,good,My 5 month old german shepherd/rotty loves it. Its kind of like licorice. easy to break apart but does not fall apart. Too bad it was gone in less than a week. lol
18651,B00008JOL0,AR0XHWS2E4RH1,Mary A. Mattox buttonpie,1/1,1335830400,My PUPPY loves these!  They aren't just for older dogs,I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit. they smell good to me too. haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically. and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life - there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China. and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.
18656,B00008JOL0,A3HPCRD9RX351S,Spudman,1/1,1299628800,Hip Hip Hooray for Zuke's,We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another.
18662,B00008JOL0,A8L8RG07ATZS3,L. Gossett,1/1,1170720000,It Works!,We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him. but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action. and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed. so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine). but he's doing great...running up and down stairs. playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action. but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.
18668,B00008JOL0,AS5VIFYZBZTSA,3chis&amp;adobe,0/0,1346716800,Great product,I thought I would try these as a last attempt at getting my dogs to take Glucosamine willingly- It worked even for my 3 lb chihuahua who won't eat any treats!!! I have 3 chihuahuas and a doberman and they all love these!! I will warn you- they smell horrible. but I have found the worse a treat smells the more the pups like them!! lol. I will be buying these again!

I pack a few for our hikes and they seem to give our 10 year old LAB that extra boost that he needs!  I can see the difference in his energy when we run out of them so I try my best to keep them stocked.  They seem to help him!  Amazon is the best price around.  His favorite is the Peanut Butter!
18698,B00008JOL0,A3MGVBGYQAZ7PA,Granny9,0/0,1317168000,Great for all dogs!,Our older dog has arthritis in his right hip.  These had good recommendations so I purchased for him.  He loves them!  Our retriever is younger but I've given them to him also just as a preventative.
18733,B000FFRU3U,A1C4IVZA42ZWT2,M. Barbarow,1/1,1236988800,Tastes OK,I bought this product because of the convenience to take anywhere. Price is great. but the taste was pretty bland. I was definitely full after eating this. but the taste wasn't what I expected. Try for yourself!
18762,B001534R00,A1UBHWCJYZ62T8,Corwin G. Lemon,1/1,1295222400,Weight Loss vs. Energy Drink,If you are looking for a product that is going to help you lose weight. then perhaps look elsewhere. This drink has a lot of good ingredients in it. but like nearly everything out there on the market. it chiefly relies on thermogenics. with the main active of caffeine. Caffeine's effectiveness is affected by the fact that your body builds a tolerance to it. so as a weightloss program. the effectiveness of this product decreases over time (and you're only talking maybe 2 weeks here. depending on how often you take it).<br /><br />If. however. you are looking for an energy drink. I'd HIGHLY recommend Celsius. I started drinking this stuff a few years back before its distribution was up. and I've not been disappointed. It will definitely ramp you up. and because its very low sugar. you don't have the associated crash you get with drinks like Monster and Rockstar. Plus. the Ginger is a nice touch. I typically have big energy dips after meals. but it I drink one of these before or during a meal (like lunch). I don't experience the dip. My educated guess is that the ginger (which aids in digestion) is a big part of this. and it's an ingredient you don't find in other drinks.<br /><br />Tastes. vary from person to person. but I find Celsius's flavor strangely addictive. I drink the Wild Berry and the Sparkling Orange.<br /><br />Overall. this product gets my highest praises. and the shipping on it is lightning fast (like. 2 days to get to my door on regular shipping). Just know what you are putting into your body. and realize there is a fairly heavy dose of caffeine in this stuff (200 mg).
18763,B001534R00,A3VWQ3BZJ5TUH1,S. Provo smokin' sue's jerky,1/1,1277337600,Love this stuff!,I really love this stuff!  It tasted kind of weird at first but I got used to it real quick and now I look forward to drinking them.  I bought 1 case each of berry. orange and coke and like them equally.  I had been getting up at 4:30 am to make myself walk a couple of miles on the treadmill but now I take one of these with me and by mile 2 I just don't want to quit walking.  I started this about 2 weeks ago and have lost 5 lbs so far. and that's even with partying in Reno for 3 days.<br /><br />I feel great. full of energy!  I'm up to 4 miles on the treadmill in about an hour. I will drink another celsius around lunch time and it keeps me going for the rest of the afternoon.  I highly recommend this drink.
18772,B001534R00,A1C7CWZSXVRVKJ,Jimbo,0/0,1304380800,Celsius does what it says for me.,I bought some of this stuff at Costco. Then I drank about 3/4 of an 8oz can before I went to Ballys.  Wow what a difference it made for me.  Up to now. I always would take an cytomax drink with me because I would get the sugar shakes and/or have an energy lag or crash during my workout that the extra carbs in the drink would mitigate.  Anyway. I did not use one this day and I felt so energized that I swore that this product would be taken off the market for being too good.  I am 62 and I felt like this was a drink from the fountain of youth.  I did not get a low sugar crash even though I worked out longer and harder then I have for ages.  (I usually work out 2 or 3 times a week). While I was riding high during my workout I thought that I would pay an energy price later.  Nope! I was just energized the rest of the day and was able to sleep fine when I went to bed at night.  This stuff worked for me.
18787,B001PO7FIU,A1KK66VC8S9OMP,K. Hedges,91/92,1300924800,UPDATED: RECIEVED RANCID OIL,I recieved this oil last week and it is rancid. It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Amazon when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Amazon. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back. until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address. but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future. but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Amazon will not take back food items.<br /><br />As far as the oil. the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world. I plan to try them all out now. from the La Tourangelle website. Companies that go above and beyond will always get my business because they actually care about their product. Thank you La Tourangelle!
18799,B001PO7FIU,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,Margaret Picky,5/5,1328400000,Excellent quality oil with a delicate color. flavor. and fragrance,La Tourangelle Avocado Oil has a beautiful pale green color and a wonderful but delicate fragrance and flavor of avocados.  It is not at all bitter.  Avocado oil is pressed from the flesh of the avocado. not the seed.<br /><br />It is especially good drizzled on fresh-baked bread or pizza.  It is nice on a salad although if there are other strong flavors for it to compete with such as balsamic vinegar. onions. or cheese. consider using a less expensive oil with a more competitive flavor such as first-press olive oil and save this for when you can better appreciate its unique sensory qualities.  There is a recipe on the label for a citrus dressing with equal parts of this oil and citrus juice with a little honey. salt. and pepper which complements the flavor of the oil rather than overpowers it as a dressing with vinegar does.<br /><br />Avocado oil also has a medium-high smoke point. higher than that of olive oil. so it is safer to use for cooking on the stove top although there are less expensive oils just as suitable for this purpose.<br /><br />Avocado oil is also an excellent oil for use on the skin and the scent is pleasant enough that I will dab a little on my elbows and knuckles when using it in the kitchen.<br /><br />The oil is packaged in a can to protect it from light and the lid fits tightly. although I have found that it will drip from the spout and collect on top of the can.  Twisting the can at the end of the pour (as with a bottle of wine) helps prevent this.  It can be stored at a reasonable room temperature but it would be better off in the refrigerator in warm climates or instead of over the oven.<br /><br />I purchased my La Tourangelle Avocado Oil at a organic grocery store chain (known for high prices) because other customers have reported that they have received rancid cans from Amazon. probably from sitting in a hot warehouse.  Let's hope Amazon addresses this issue and also provides appropriate packaging to protect the attractive can during shipping as the price is significantly lower here.
18801,B001PO7FIU,A33QIOA2EYW0LC,Tee,4/4,1328832000,Awesome price and quality...no dent cans,I wonder if someone started listening to the reviews on here of dented cans? Mine was shipped in a box with air-filled bags inside of another box with a ton more air-filled bags. No dents.<br /><br />I purchased this oil for two reasons. One. homemade healthy mayonnaise. Two. high smoking point. I used it last night to deep fry some soft corn tortillas to make hard taco shells. Worked great. No gross after taste like you get with canola. I also deep fried some flour tortillas for my husband (I have a wheat allergy). and he LOVED them. The great part is I can deep fry and not have to feel guilty about serving up rancid. omega-6 filled food. Very happy.
18823,B001PO7FIU,A1OLIXUEH0IHKJ,amorfortuna2,1/1,1317513600,The best.,I love this avocado oil- rich. easy to pour. great tasting.  I buy avocado oil because of the omega-3 health benefits and because I read that it's one of the best oils to stand up to high heat. so I use it for cooking fish and burgers. etc  and still use olive oil for vegetables at low to medium heat.
18824,B001PO7FIU,A32GAAXZLV656Y,crystal,1/1,1314576000,bliss of avacodo oil,This avocado oil is one of the most multitaskful useful products ive ever used... Great for skin. hair. and cooking. A must-have product!

18849,B0007ZPY2C,A3GTHBGPYBTB1J,B. Valentine I am out to prove I have nothin...,2/2,1169769600,Straight from Jamaica,I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica. so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other Jamaica grown products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside. just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees. you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

18857,B0007ZPY2C,AMRGQ0SDOOMLQ,PNWHiker,0/1,1199750400,Nothing special,I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point. our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.
18876,B000F4H5FY,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,E. Hernandez,0/0,1341619200,Royal fireworks indeed,Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors. Tea Bags. 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) at $17.14 is a STEAL.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Twinings tea. then perhaps you ought to start tasting REAL tea - the type the Royal Family awakens to. the type everyone who enjoys tea outside the U.S. enjoys at tea time.<br /><br />Twinings. around since the beginning of the 18th century. literally saved my life. While I shall not go into that story. I will tell you what you can expect: a decent. dazzling cup of tea that will. I guarantee. make you basically drop coffee forever.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the meal known as 'tea' since I was a boy. My parents avoided it for some reason but I always had my Twinings. Since it got too complex hereabouts. I just order tea bags these days instead of a good old-fashioned brew-up with my favorite antique English teapot.<br /><br />It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast. Irish Breakfast. Earl Grey and Lady Grey. For you ignorant slobs. Irish breakfast is the finest. blackest and strongest tea you can get. English is a bit dialed back but it is just as hearty. These beg for cream and sugar. but it is no sin to have it black. The Greys are meant to be taken with lemon and you'll suffer if you try to pour cream or milk into either of them!<br /><br />So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box. from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that. You can visit their site and buy direct; you can examine <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RXQ2CY>The Queen</a> closely and watch for the scene that reveals the Queen Mum's preferred tea.<br /><br />My second favorite. Irish breakfast tea being my first love. is the incomparable <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MOWL8M>Twinings English Afternoon Tea. Tea Bags. 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a>. blended from premium Keemun and Ceylon (just you try to get good Keemun at a reasonable price).<br /><br />In the event it interests you. Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention. the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named FLOW-THROUGH) that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags. unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings good cheer. the genuine cup that cheers.
18896,B003FSPWXY,AIQDUKFB4X38M,VonMalcolm,0/0,1349136000,Decent Meal Starter,This stroganoff doesn't have a robust flavor. but with a little help (spices. cheese. etc.) it can help make for a good meal.  I haven't made it with a meat base. which would probably help the flavor. -but I added cauliflower. okra. kale. Parmesan and Cajun spices and it turned out pretty darn good. Some other creations have turned out decent as well (-but a few others not so much!).
18904,B003SC0Q4C,A20GVR1RTE3DVU,CE Lilly Pad,1/1,1333584000,Wow!,Bought this flavor and brand for the first time. I have powered Stevia that I have been using to add sweetness to certain things and was surprised and my liking Stevia. I love ginger and love strong flavors. This ginger drink made me cough because the fumes got in my nose and throat my first sip but I did not have ice to make it less strong. If you love strong ginger flavor like I do this is a good sign and if its natural then the flavor is fine. I liked it and will buy it again and want to try the other flavors.
18923,B000F4H5FE,A1DU3OP9MTYG9S,TheEditor,2/2,1293580800,The Crowning Green Tea,Green Tea is amazing! I was first exposed to it while stationed in Okinawa many years ago. At first I did not like the taste because I was used to that cheap orange pekoe Lipton junk I grew up with. But after a day or two. I was hooked. Twinnings has captured that classic Green Tea energy. This tea is both relaxing and energizing. which makes it difficult to both describe and explain. However. when you try a tin. you will know what I mean. We now buy all our teas on Amazon because they have made it most affordable and very. very easy. Kudos to both Amazon and Twinnings...a winning combination!

Secondly that it works much much faster.  Before I'd put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results.  NOT SO WITH THE HOT SHOT!!  Put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reduced.<br /><br />This clear gel is much thicker than the Combat product.  A small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will need.<br /><br />The only downside to this product that I've come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses.  A couple of times I've pushed so hard to get it started. that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once (made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel).  In the future I'm going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each use.<br /><br />Another nice advantage is that the gel is clear.  The other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch. an amber color.  At times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner.  This product is less noticeable.<br /><br />The tip is long enough to be able to push the product into crevices.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
18999,B000F4H5FO,A224M5U25WRUS4,trev155,0/0,1168560000,King (or is it Queen?!) of Teas!,The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey<br /><br />(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:<br /><br />Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl. this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey. *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings. you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example. some other companies market a blend called Pouchkine or Afternoon Earl Grey which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably. the cornflowers).

I don't allow regular cheetos in the house because of what's in them and this one is allowed because of what's not. When you find artificial preservatives/flavor enhancers in food that's not good for anyone. and if someone has a learning disability those preservatives can make those kind of symptoms worse.  If you can pronounce it. you probably shouldn't be eating it.  This a  very tasty and much healthier crunchy snack that can be enjoyed by anyone.

Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days. long ago!  Only gripes: the partially-hydrogenated ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way. the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

The aftertaste they are complaining about with this soda is the complex Birch oil aftertaste (in any real old recipe). I used to live in Quarryville. Pennsylvania and my neighbor showed me and my family how to make Birch brew with the cleaned roots. and the aftertaste is the same here. We live in a society with everything watered down to the point it all tastes like nothing with sugar added.  This is the best commercial root beer I have tasted sugar or not.

19101,B000LQNK96,A2THVBUFHI0MOX,BC BC,8/10,1214179200,Positive on Noodle - Negative on crushed Delivery.,Price - I generally get this at an Asian market store so I have to say if you can't get it locally. then having it delivered seems like a great idea unless Amazon throws out a deal which makes it better.  I jumped on a deal with mixed results.<br /><br />Taste - this is one of my picks for this type of noodle ( Udon )thicker type.  It is on the spicy side.  Yes. have to agree it is seafood but a blended taste.  The dried seaweed / dried little fish disks ( like those imitation crab legs made of ground fish sticks )gives it more appeal.<br /><br />Delivery - I write this because you'll get noodle that are crushed on both sides.  I cringe at the thought of the other box I haven't opened yet.  Basically. your product condition is your selling point.  The problem is somehow in delivery or I suspect before boxing. the noodles are crushed so you end up something along the lines of a pill capsule shape.  Every one opened so far and these are along the edge of the box not the center yet.  When the significant other opened one and said said it was crushed. I thought well. time to post this so no one else is surprised.

19172,B001E5E20O,A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,Kaleidocherry,3/3,1224979200,Slightly different from standard Earl Grey,This tea has an interesting scent in the can.  It's like bergamot overlaid with jasmine or some other unusual flower.  As a brewed tea it's all right but sniffing the dry tea was unpleasant.  I think we will stick with Republic of Tea or Yorkshire Gold.

Niedt,0/0,1225584000,Rishi Tea - Great Earl Grey,Opening the second. tightly sealed. metal lid on the organic Earl Grey by Rishi Tea. the aromatic fragrance of fresh tea and bergamot citrus which characterize this blend filled the air.  The resulting brew did not disappoint; it was smooth and rich with a citrus tang.  I followed the directions exactly. pouring rapidly boiling water over a tablespoon of leaves placed in my infuser. and allowing it to steep for four minutes. The cup of tea was enhanced by the awareness that. in addition to enjoying the fine flavor. I was supporting an ethnic Chinese family by using an organic. Fair Trade Certified product.  It was a win-win situation - great tea and ecological balance.  (The package was even correct in promising that the leaves could withstand a second steep!)

19317,B002ACU9XY,A1QP17D4X705C,"L.D, Wright",4/4,1340409600,True coffee taste,My husband has been Decaf for 20 years.  So for 20 years he has searched for a Decaf that tastes like REAL coffee.  We use a Senseo Supreme (chrome look) coffee pod machine with 16 strength settings depending on pod holder. LED brew strenth. and cup size selections you use on the machine.<br /><br />After a 20 year search the Baronet 100% Columbian medium roast brought a smile back to his face.  I use regular full roasts and I prefer the Baronet Izzy medium roast and also like the Baronet French Vannila pods. (more of a 'chick' blend)  But do not let that fool you.  If you want a bold coffee the dark or bold Baronet brands that our younger friends prefer are 'truck driver' approved.  We keep them on hand for guests so buy the variety pack or a simple Dark Roast.<br /><br />These pods will work in your Senseo however if you buy the pods in the foil packs that come in the box (stay fresher) they are larger and you may need to use the 2 pod holder with a single pod if you have the black machine.  However. one pod will 'mash' down ok in the one pod holder of the Supreme Senseo machine.  Yes. that wonderfull foam froth is still there. Pods that come loose. 18 to a package. are the same size as the Senseo pods.

One day we were shopping in the other desert near Palm Springs and I saw a stand up sign for bubble tea at the food court.  We walked the entire length of the shopping mall so I could buy her a bubble tea. and the STAND WAS CLOSED !!  When I saw that Amazon (my favorite place) had bubble tea kits. I ordered one of each.  I sent the kits to my sister in Desert Hot Springs so she could make and take the bubble tea to Aunt Ruth.  Thank you for allowing me to fulfill another item on her bucket list !!

19371,B001EO5YB6,A2PATWWZAXHQYA,Farnoosh Brock,8/8,1207699200,Good tea. captivating aroma. light body,I had already tasted Citron Oolong a few years ago in Barefoot coffee shop in Palo Alto. CA. It is a delicious tea. My friends even enjoyed it. It is not a heavy oolong tea. or even the traditional oolong such as Iron goddess of mercy or Jade oolong. both of which are my ultimate favorites. Also. know this: Rishi makes the best oolong tea so do not skimp on your tea :)! Be sure not to overbrew. and follow instructions on how much to use. Also use filtered water to boil. it will improve the taste over tap water. I love using my brita water in the zojirushi which has hot water ready to go at all times at my house.

We ordered two bags and no problem. Our rat terrier and my daughter's standard schnauzer love this food. They rejected several other brands and flavors before we found this food.

19455,B000BXX20G,A3R2WD4YOFMSRU,Tyra Baginski,1/1,1270944000,Great Tea!,Revolution's White Pear Tea is my most often repeat/requested tea by guests. People just love it. with or without half & half. The pear flavor is pleasantly accurate- natural taste. Very appealing! But when adding this tea to your collection. don't forget Teaosophy's Black Kerala (an absolute 5 star black). Teaosophy's Darjeeling Green and/or Two Leaves and A Bud's Tamayokucha Green. Finish it with a good quality monkey picked oolong and you will have the best of the beloved Camellia sinensis plant!
19456,B000BXX20G,A13HRSMJ5TOWEZ,IrishFire,0/0,1350518400,This Tea is Lovely,I'm a fan!  This tea is not bitter. and forgives a wide range of temps and steep times.  In fact. my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills. by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out. so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The green flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash. though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious. tastes like real pear. and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea. and you like pears. give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a resealable freshness bag. though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way. and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea. which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag. and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas. but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests. that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags. and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which. as I mentioned. I am very fond of). but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!
19471,B003AVR176,A15OCOGU45XXIW,Sara Curley Barberee,26/28,1293753600,Be Very Careful,After I tasted a bottle of Ocean Spray Cranbery product that was labeled 100% juice' in big letters and the word cranberry underneath I realized that it was way too sweet to be 100% cranberry juice.  When I finally looked at the tiny dark red strip at the bottom of the label. I found that it was combined with grape. apple. and other juices.  I called the 1-800 customer info line and asked if I could order the 100% cranberry juice from the website. the customer service representative told me that Ocean Spray doesn't make that product.  When I asked for the percentage of cranberry juicr in the product. she said that she did not have that information.  When I asked where I could find out. she said she didn't know.  Truth in advertising?  Their commercials show funny men standing in cranberry bogs.  Give me a break.  And if you are needing the cranberry juice for your health. be VERY careful.

Yes. the rolls are less expensive. but they do not have the same consistency or mouth feel as the mints of the same flavor that are sold in tins.  Also. the mints in tins do seem to last longer. so I wonder if these rolls (though convenient) are even a better bargain.  I would not purchase these again; rather. I will spring for a few extra dollars and continue to purchase the Newman's Own Mints in tins.
19498,B001397X3O,AUDQIJOG4JI87,Georgia on my mind,0/0,1269129600,Love these.....but a comment about last order.....,I recently (December '10) reordered these mints (I can't find them where I live. so I order them on a fairly regular basis) & it seems that something was missing in this batch.....the cinnamon flavor! So far. every roll has been nothing but sugar.....has anyone else had this 'problem'????<br /><br />  I first tried these a couple of months ago when I saw them at a Whole Foods store. I was instantly hooked! They are so good. I had to find a steady supply of them (I don't have a Whole Foods where I live) & was so glad Amazon.com had them. I have ordered them twice & they never last long-everyone that tries them loves them. I've tried the other mints that Newman's Own makes. but the Cinnamon mints are by far my favorite. I love the texture. the 'just-right' cinnamon flavor & the fact that I'm supporting a company that does so many good things.
19542,B000084ETV,A105BOR5D5S7CJ,ARL,0/0,1235606400,After feeding for 5 years. we're done,We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly. never had stomach upset. and got raves from the vet for their muscle. weight. and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags. but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie. who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues. began to have horrible gas. softer stools. and really loud. liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag. thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well. our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms. and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown. and our Aussie's stomach noises. soft stools. and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours. and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change. made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise. a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova. California Natural. and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.

Canidae may cost more than better-known brands. but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food. but it's true she has basically no smell. as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy. happy. clean. and puppy-like.
19593,B000084ETV,A2VZIJHABHMIQW,P. R. Schlosser REAL DOG LOVER,6/7,1218153600,Canidae made my dogs VERY SICK,New food and or changed formula's need to be introduced to animals slowly. Very slowly. However. I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs. 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted. the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile. I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way. what WAS wrong with the old formula????
19603,B000084ETV,A2B5DO16H6OQGJ,tonksmom,3/3,1231113600,My Dogs Love Canidae!!!!!,My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently. I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44 bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food.
19622,B000084ETV,A2ZIQANFTS7AX1,Huck Finn,1/1,1318982400,Food is Great. Delivery was BAD!,I have been feeding Canidae for a long time. and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes. I figured I needed to start buying online.  The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores. and it is a great food overall.  The only issues I have had are with the delivery.  One of the bags I bought was broke open. so when I took the bag out of the shipping box. dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th. and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th. which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.  Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous. but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly.
19630,B000084ETV,A1V3QP9L9DVQWL,ElanGrey,1/1,1316044800,Canidae All Life Stage dog food (dry),Excellent price for this dog food--as well as prompt.easy delivery to my front doorstep!Certainly makes hauling large bags like this a lot easier.This is the only food I feed my pets--and the price is by far the best around:both locally in store here--AND thorugh other pet supply mail order services.I recommend it.
19642,B000084ETV,A33YBKXF13A81D,Koeeaddi shmuelman,1/1,1219795200,New formula (Aug. 2008) is no good,This was a fine food until some time in early August. 2008. I bought two bags. this formula for my old. 140 lb dog. and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag. and I switched him to Innova. the diarrhea cleared up immediately. so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog. to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.
19649,B000084ETV,A2QDVYO7VCQ3VX,J. Jang,2/3,1222819200,Company sold out. No different from regular grocery dog food.,I was a huge fan of canidae. but beginning about a month ago. the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials. smaller bags. and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes. the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams. eureka. etc.
19695,B0030VBRIU,A3FIV3X7H4VLI7,mandm,0/0,1310601600,great food,I got this food for my little one in all the flavors.  I have to say the chicken is her favorite.  The pouch is great for traveling. and is a good portion size.  The consistency is a little chunky. just right for mine with 4 teeth.  One pouch and some finger foods is perfect for her.
19705,B0030VBRIU,A2MF0C4E7GYCI,VW VW,0/0,1305331200,My son loves this,My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time. but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain. but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic. wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line.
19707,B0030VBRIU,A3LFOYGPCS5EOA,J. McElliott,0/0,1304380800,Happy Salmon Eating Baby,I was worried about it before I served it to my 12 month old... but after a tentative first session (there is a pretty strong salmon smell. and he seems opposed to strong scents). he's since eaten this package w/o problem. and finishes it every time!  We're pretty pleased with this meal - great texture and I feel good that he's getting some salmon in his diet.  We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch. but since it only happened once. I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package. but definitely I keep an eye for now.  It might have been one bad package in the stack... so it's still probably advisable to not serve this if you're going to be away from home :).
19713,B0030VBRIU,A1HW28P8ONVBH2,SM&A,1/2,1305676800,did not meet my expectations,My baby and I both loved the stage 1 Happy Baby pouches that we tried. so I had high hopes for this as well. To my dismay. it smelled like cat food and was gritty. I expected there to be more morsels of food.  but this was just mush. My son took a few bites and refused to eat any more.
19715,B0030VBRIU,A1G0U51YRASVP5,Shannon Eisel,1/2,1298246400,Not so hot,My baby loves Happy Baby's Chick Chick meal. so we tried the salmon. It is the first food that my 11 month old has ever spit back at me. I tried to feed him this four different days to see if he would get used to it. or change his mind. No luck. It's too bad that you can only purchase them in lots of 16.... lots of leftover salmon here.
19738,B0030VBRIU,A3DLCJQO7827TL,GU Customer and Mom GRU,5/5,1276992000,Might be good for you but very blah!,While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out. it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah. bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition. since it's a stage 3 food. I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables. however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating.
19751,B0030VBRIU,A2QV1V06YJSQKQ,Renee Frank,3/3,1280188800,Baby loved it!,I bought this for my grandson.  I used it for the in between stage from strained food to small finger food. He really liked this. He loves sweet potatoes so this was great!
19756,B0030VBRIU,A3GZHTNXM0QP01,K. McCaslin katiemcc,2/2,1338076800,Baby hates new recipe...,Not sure why they decided to mess with a good thing. We've cancelled our subscriptions to both the Chick Chick and Salmon HappyBaby pouches. A huge disappointment to our family as these were two go to meals in our household for our 14 month old. Please bring back the old formula. HappyBaby!
19762,B0030VBRIU,A14814911LYINA,G. Rumph,2/2,1289001600,Great Product,My daughter loves this food. This is her favorite of all the HappyBaby Organic Baby Food. I make all of her fruits and vegetables but decided not to continue this with the meats. She did great transitioning from the food I make at home to this packaged product so it must taste pretty fresh.
19769,B0030VBRIU,A1PZ9580938SVM,kcv,1/1,1332288000,Bring back the old formula!!,Was so disappointed to discover that HappyBaby changed Super Salmon!  My little girl LOVED the old formula. and it had more protein and calories than this new version.  The new version also has more sugar and sodium than the previous version. and it has a completely different taste and texture - she won't touch it.  We will not be buying it again.
19771,B0030VBRIU,AW249T3BHIMCV,mamabear,1/1,1329523200,Not a fan,The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content. the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product.
19781,B0030VBRIU,A1S6HK2R1KUC5E,data1701,1/1,1318291200,Triplets love this!,This is very smooth and easy to feed to my triplets.  They love it.  I like that is has great vegetables in it also.
19798,B0030VBRIU,A3A0DJF0OK1JUM,mojobear,1/1,1277078400,Love these pouches!,These pouches were very easy to take with us and the baby just LOVED it! No leftovers here. I really like that they come in two protein varieties - chicken and a turkey! Great options and easy to take with you!!
19799,B0030VBRIU,A16L79U8FID0GW,Gabriela Pareja M.,1/1,1274918400,Excelent food for allergic baby!!!,My 15 months baby girl has allergy to cow's milk proteins.<br /><br />I can guarantee that this food is one of the few brands that do not contain potential allergens. And also. contain a higher nutritional value to other foods sold in the market.<br />My baby prefers warm. For this I put a few minutes in hot water.<br /><br />Amaranth Ratatuille y Chick chick are her favorites!
19829,B00390T5JA,AFW6YYTKD4S8C,Wild Thing,1/2,1321056000,Easy to use. less complicated than it looks,It came adequately packaged. Lots of padding to protect it during shipping. Getting it out of the box and setting it up for first time use was not a problem.<br /><br />I've been wanting to get of these since I used one at a doctors lounge. It's very convenient and makes very good coffee.<br /><br />I thought of getting the CBTL Contata or Kaldi because they had a 220 volt version but they are both plasticky compared to this. The selection of capsules was limited compared to the number of K-cups.<br /><br />If you're buying it for overseas use. please make sure you get a stepdown transformer appropriate for 2000 to 3000 watts even though the unit is rated at 1400 watts.<br /><br />This is easy to clean. requires minimal maintenance and is easy to learn how to use. I have 2 of these. one in the office and at home.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's just me but I think the reservoir needs to be a bit bigger. I've been refilling it quite often.
19839,B00390T5JA,A3LWSVRLOINT1M,Indy,15/15,1311120000,Keurig Brewer,Like this product. but. wish the brewer made the larger cup size as the higher priced one.  It is a good brewer though.  Have had it for about a month or so.  If you want the largest mug size. I advise to pay the extra money.  I only use for a late<br />evening cup.  I use my regular coffee maker for mornings.  The K-Cups are pricy.  You need to shop around for best price or use refillable Solofill.  See my review on that.
19846,B00390T5JA,A3C6T903HRU0TQ,Addie Hamilton,5/5,1325289600,VERY DISAPPOINTING,We have this model about a year now.  It hasn't worked right from the beginning.  We often had trouble closing the top.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Other times it works like a charm.  When it works like a charm. it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says. DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine.for the K-cup that couldn't be used. and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out. they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.
19851,B00390T5JA,A1TF9EYT8FEPZP,C. E. Dalli Cardillo,3/3,1325980800,Happy with it. but remember to DESCALE the unit!,I have had this model for a little over a year and am quite happy with it.  It functions well and like any Keurig product is easy to use.  I purchased the ecobrew filters since I prefer to grind my own coffee and it is far less expensive.  Recently however I was getting very little water despite pushing the button for the larger cup.  I had not descaled my machine as I only use water that has come through the Zero Water filter system and the fact that the descale light never came on.  I decided to descale anyway and after I did it is back to its normal performance level.  Lesson learned - DESCALE AS RECOMMENDED EVEN IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON!
19862,B00390T5JA,AB5M1G8ZRP9XJ,Vince,2/2,1324857600,Dissapointed,this review is coming from a person who enjoys coffee more than the average morning coffee drinker. I requested a Keurig machine for Christmas. I thought single serve would be better than it is. I like the concept of a diverse coffee selection just for you. when you want it. I was disappointed with the plastic after taste and smell as well as watery flavor. the k cups do not have instruction of cup size. Not a good experience for me. keurig has discussed on their site that they are working on an alternate packaging that would also be recyclable. Until then I'll make it in the pot.
19871,B00390T5JA,A15U64VGUV6RBF,S. Carlson,1/1,1337040000,When you're not in the mood for a full pot,Single cup brewers seem to be the wave of the home coffee making future. And nobody seems to do it better than Keurig. This machine is simple to operate. requires very little cleaning. and just brews a very good cup of coffee. And with the plethora of K-Cup options out there (teas. hot chocolates. etc.) your hot beverages options are next to limitless. This unit doesn't include any K-cups. so just make sure to order some along with it. or look at the EkoBrew reusable K-Cup as an option (see my other reviews).
19874,B00390T5JA,A8IT0DA46W3I6,Patricia J. Washington,1/1,1334016000,My Special Review,Now this is the way everyone should drink coffee. I am so please with this product. Coffee even taste better.
19907,B00390T5JA,AB70TXTFI1FJ9,Jen,0/0,1331942400,great tasting coffee and great for single coffee drinker households,First. I found this product for about $80-90 through dealnews.com (I think I bought it at newegg.com) and I've seen it for similar prices when on sale and even less than what I purchased it for at the time.  I love this unit.  It is soooo much better than coffee maker coffee and very easy and fool-proof.  It is expensive to buy k-cups. but cheaper than buying coffee at DD or somewhere else (saves on time too).  Plus I am going to try to get the reusable k-cups to make it cheaper and more friendly to the environment.  I do like how you can select either a small or large cup with this unit and I like how the water tank is dishwasher safe.  I wouldn't get anything smaller than this unit because you will be filling up the water tank constantly even with a single user household like mine.  I would say I get about 4-5 cups from this unit until having to refill.
19910,B00390T5JA,A3IOFDFR6EVS9P,Hot Dog King,0/0,1330214400,Great coffee maker,We purchase 2 of these coffee makers. They were gifts to our Mom and Dad. They work great.no problem. The prices was great.
19933,B0042GUIV4,A2NRNO4MDXRR3N,Tom Farrell,0/0,1333843200,Best Chocolate,See's. in my opinion. makes absolutely the best chocolate in the United States. I sure wish they would make it eligible for Amazon Prime. I'd get a subscription for 2lbs a month lol.
19935,B0042GUIV4,A2U439EVGP8RG3,AndreStefan,0/0,1327449600,See's gets 5 stars. but shipping charge gets ONE star.,By far. the best chocolate in the USA. Better than Godiva. I think. but others may disagree. I LOVE See's Candies. BUT the shipping cost is almost the same as the pound of truffles.  I know shipping chocolate may be difficult during hot or cold times. but geez. something has to be done about this..... Maybe buy multiple See's products for shipping discounts? we don't have See's stores in the East. just little stands in malls during the holiday season with few choices. I WANT MY SEE'S KEY LIME WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES.  Your best bet is to search amazon's grocery and gourmet food site and find discounts. During the winter holidays. I got terrific truffles at a deep discount. regularly $100 for $20 plus free shipping.
19942,B000NPZUBG,A8ABIF43211KA,S. Holsey,0/0,1349222400,I'm a Horehound addict,I love these things. cant stop eating them. Not much else to write regarding a piece of candy. I shared a couple bags with family members and they love them too. Excellent flavor.
19949,B0013M1DC8,A1Y39T2CT36YL0,Resips,6/6,1253577600,Wonderful seasoning salt - give it a try.,I use this porcini salt in many savory dishes - cooked entrees and salads. Delicious. You don't have to use a lot for it to make a big difference. Just a small sprinkle will do the job. It seems expensive for such a little jar but the impact from just a small sprinkle is worth the cost.
19953,B001IZA22W,A10U4D5LGW7D8O,Victoria Walton,1/1,1311292800,Excellent tea!,This is a very good tea--it tastes somewhat like an infusion of green tea with a peppermint leaves. It comes from Chile and it reminds me of Yerba Mate. It is natural and has many health benefits--mostly detoxifying the system. All the women in my family drink it and they swear it keeps their system in tip top shape and bc of that. their skin is supple and beautiful. Some of them are between 55-72 and their complexions are flawless. I developed some age spots on my face and have started drinking it on a daily basis.<br />The package contains 12 boxes. It was wrapped well and it arrived on time. The price is extremely reasonable for this product. Thanks!
19960,B003752LCU,AEQFOHOVS3XV6,Arieh R. Whisenhunt,6/6,1271289600,Another great shipment of flowers,I have to say that once again I'm impressed with Spring in the Air.  The order was shipped almost at the speed of light and I got their beautiful flowers faster than I expected.  Fortunately the vases I ordered to put them in arrived at the same time.  Price is right. service is fantastic and delivery is number one.  They are my first choice now for flowers.
19966,B001G0NKVO,A3CG93783LP0FO,Yarii,3/3,1303344000,Good for constipated kitties,One of my cats has had a chronic constipation problem most of her life.  The Friskies Indoor Selects Classic Chicken Entree is her favorite flavor of all.  Since this has brown rice and spinach as some of the ingredients it has helped keep Stinky a little more regular.  My vet believes all cats should get *some* wet food per day - he gave his approval on this brand over some of the others. even though it's a grocery store brand.  Occasionally I still have to help her along with an 1/8 tsp. of Miralax mixed into this. but she doesn't even notice the Miralax. she still laps this up and begs for more.
19978,B007AIUD2K,A2KFKEME4A9ATW,C. Petra PETRAFYD,0/0,1348790400,Aloe vera gel. Honey. High Frutose Corn Syrup...,My 2nd adventure for health into ingesting Aloe.  My first taste had me realizing this was way too sweet to be a health drink.  Upon examination the very small font list of ingredients. I found; 1st Aloe Gel. 2nd Honey(surprising). 3rd High Fructose Corn Syrup... yep... 15 grams of sugars per cup 160ml the bottle that is the size of a small bought water bottle is 500ml... I easily gulped it down before my full study was complete. Down the end of ingredients there is artificial green grape flavor...we all need that...to match the green bottle I guess.<br />  After I mixed it 50/50 with filtered water I was able to actually taste other than sweet and it was not bad with a bit of pulp that I liked as in pulp orange juice.  I added some pure Aloe Juice to get it closer to the health drink I stupidly assumed associated with Aloe... and will make it thru the case I ordered.<br /><br /> I suppose if your looking for a better after school replacement drink than say.. Mt Dew. for one of the many new obese children it may suffice...but keep a tongue depressor handy for surely down the road they will be falling down and shaking at this sugar level as well.
19979,B002C50X1M,A1KKE6VX8VPWZK,J. J. Marino Geekasaurus Rex,10/11,1272067200,Fantastic gourmet chip - this flavor is one of the best.,I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting. unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.
19991,B002C50X1M,A2W7L2F36SOBFD,OnQ 4U,0/0,1315785600,Great Tasting. just wish they were thicker cut.,These are very good chips. The Asian Sweet & Spicy--not too sweet. not too spicy. or salty--perfectly balanced seasoning. We received very fresh packages.  I just like thicker cut potato chips especially being kettle cooked. but that will not deter me from ordering again.
19998,B002C50X1M,A17TPOSAG43GSM,Herrick,0/0,1303171200,Pretty good. but prefer other jalapeno chips,I was expecting some serious flavor as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had. it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short. which is a plus. and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less. as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do. stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.
20001,B002C50X1M,A2WV4N0X29CIFN,leecash2fly,0/0,1294099200,Great Chips,I recently bought these chips.  Came home and only three bags were left in the box.  My whole family loves them.  They have great flavor and better and healthier than more chips. I'm ordering a few more boxes today
20006,B002C50X1M,A28CUV51TCMFVQ,Karen Frances,0/0,1274918400,just the right size package; great chips,Very nice chips; just the right size to serve with a sandwich and watch my calories.
20008,B002C50X1M,AGS1GGTC4ZK4V,Orton Redux,0/0,1260489600,Superior chips - wow!,This is a re-post of the review I left for the 5 oz bags ... Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon - and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil. ending in a surprisingly smoky note.
20014,B002C50X1M,A1KX9LI4I9LU8H,Kathleen C. Lockhart kcl,1/2,1271203200,Excellent chips!,Love these chips.  Good for a quick snack and I don't fee TOO guilty eating them since they have less fat and salt than regular chips.  Highly recommended.

20018,B002C50X1M,A1DTQYJG91K12I,Blizz Lizz,0/1,1302998400,Too many rotten chips!,I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them. I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look. and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company. I finally found a phone number and called them. only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is. the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality. so stay away from these chips!
20021,B002C50X1M,A3RAN1B9KD553H,Denise M. Muiter,0/2,1256774400,Misleading Allergen Info,I bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients... but also specifically because they are gluten free.  I have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten... or Milk.  I was so upset when I received these to find out that they contain Milk!  I do not see this information anywhere on the product page.

20063,B008749N8Q,AGGDI4VWPPZ6J,L. Miller,2/6,1346889600,The bars are fine.  This deal is not.,I have severe diet restrictions.  All you who would like to be thin. I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal). no dairy. no nuts. no chocolate. no caffeine. no decaf. limit wheat flour. no red meat. no heavy meals. no empty stomach. and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area. finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts. and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds. and of course they're popular. so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.  They add $1.47 for shipping. but even so. that's a much better price than Amazon's offering here. If you like these. or have a lot of kids and family who do. you may want to check out that source.
20068,B000NY8OLU,A2KJ7K6MG4PIDK,Gail,0/0,1350518400,A staple in my kitchen!,I have been using this for literally decades. having found it first in the military commissaries I shopped in. I can't imagine making whipped cream without it. Leftover whipped cream is usable for a couple days if you put Whipit in the partially whipped cream. I have filled sponge cakes with flavored whipped cream (like a jelly roll style dessert). topped chocolate pots de creme for a party and had still-attractive edible leftovers (yay!). and at the holidays I can whip all the cream for pies at once instead of again the next day for the leftover pie. NOTE: It does give the whipped cream a bit denser consistency. but I actually like that. Partially whip 1 c. heavy cream + 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp vanilla extract. When volume starts to increase. sprinkle 1/4 c. to 1/3 c. powdered sugar and a packet of Whipit over it. Continue whipping JUST until max volume. If you notice volume decreasing. stop immediately!

There is only one limb instead of the 3-4 shown.<br />Thus it is not worth as much as the one in the photo.  Not such a good buy.  It WAS in good shape and<br />seems to like my home.  Will see if it lasts long enough to grow the missing branches.
20184,B0019QG5CG,A2HH1GI4CC7MGT,Joan F.,0/1,1294963200,A Perfect Gift,I was a little worried about buying a bonsai tree. sight unseen. especially since it was to be a Christmas gift for a very good friend. Needless worry! The bonsai tree was perfect; its branches were a deep green. it was planted in a black ceramic bonsai dish and included a rock. It had been packaged very well so that the soil was still damp and no branches injured during transport. The company included a sheet of very helpful instructions and a free bottle of liquid fertilizer. It's always nice to do business with a company that cares about its products. and this company certainly does.
20195,B000F42ECI,A1LCQU63F4SRLJ,Bob Condon Bob Condon,0/0,1308960000,Good Irish Breakfast Tea. but pricey.,This tea is definitely worth trying as you may find that it's your favorite.  I've tried Irish Breakfast from most online Tea Shops to try to find one that is superior.<br /><br />Taylor's has some fine teas. but I didn't find this variety superior enough to keep buying it.  I do buy their Yorkshire Gold. which is much stronger and great for when I need that.  I found that I enjoy Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast Tea just as much or more than this brand at around half the price or a little less.

20243,B001BDDTB2,A2NA4NHE5QRLZ7,marymuse,1/1,1227830400,four paws up!!!!!,With six cats in the house. let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program. My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them. but everyone from the year old cat. to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat. who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.<br /><br />The food looks like real food. not the loaf-type food so often seen in canned cat food. and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up. and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food. because that helps my eldest cat. who is missing several teeth. eat it just fine.<br /><br />I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!
20257,B001BDDTB2,A2NCIHGERK01RM,Patricia Gott,0/0,1256169600,wouldn't buy again,My cats ate it but they didn't seem to like it to well.Wouldn't buy it again.
20262,B001BDDTB2,A1Q7A78VSQ5GQ4,Nice Lady a reasonable person,0/0,1229990400,A Feast For the Most Finnicky Furry Feline,This food is a delight to give to one of the most important members of the family.  She's a bit choosy & will walk away readily from many foods. So. it is really something to watch her just gobble this down!<br /><br />The smaller sized can is nice as well for it insures that she'll eat the whole thing-down to the carrots. With the larger cans. she'll leave a third or more sitting there and it goes to waste.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine may cost a bit more. but nutritionally it is a very good meal for the kitty and she likes it. so none goes uneaten!  So. in the long run. it is a good value.<br /><br />On inspection of the cat food. it is composed of very good ingredients and is a high quality product.<br /><br />Our kitty loves it and gobbles it down at one sitting!
20264,B001BDDTB2,A1ZKGSDVP057L9,Mariane Matera,0/0,1229817600,My Cats Like It Okay. But It's Too Watery For Me,My cats all eat this. but I find it messy to serve. especially the chicken pot pie cans which seem to be 50 percent liquid. When you pull off the pop top. you can't help but get splashed by it. And it seems like you're not getting that much food for your money since it's so much liquid. The Chinese chicken is not as liquidy.<br /><br />I have no idea how to compare this to other brands price-wise because it is not sold in my state. I've never seen it in stores.
20286,B001BDDTB2,A306153FTKS9PL,Turtle502,0/0,1228694400,Good quality. but ultimately it depends on the cat's personality,I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days. and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately. my cat likes broth. and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth. my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However. this depends on your cat. What I found. however. is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural. and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However. it contains carrots. and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables. because they are naturally carnivores. so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually sesame. It has a slightly odd aroma. which doesn't seem to bother my cat. and plenty of sauce. which my cat enjoys. However. the meat in this flavor is shredded. which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie. but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective. these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus. especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture. which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen. I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately. though. it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation. since my cat will not eat the Chinese Sesame Chicken. I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor. multi-pack design.
20297,B001BDDTB2,AZFHSPEZUPGD2,Carol M,0/0,1228435200,Looks and smells high-quality. kitty likes it,My cat. who is of average pickiness. loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing. even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken. finely diced carrots. and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier. but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy. but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots. which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten. so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand. and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans. as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!
20301,B001BDDTB2,A1RLP0R1N8H8C4,Kitten Kisser,0/0,1228348800,Just like homemade!,We used to make our own cat food & this is a excellent substitute!  It looks & smells wonderful!  Get out your fork for the Chinese chicken or your spoon for the Chicken Pot Pie & dig in!<br />We have six cats & all six of them loved this!<br />The Chinese chicken is shredded white meat & a little bit of carrots in broth.  Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!<br />The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a broth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the broth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males. Door Knob Head. had crystals & blood in his urine.  The vet said it could get really expensive if the first round of treatment didn't work.  It didn't work.  Cats can eventually die from blockage if left untreated.  I researched the condition & got him to drink tons of water.  It fushed him out & he's doing great for many years!  My life would have been a lot easier if I knew about the Chicken Pot Pie.  It would have been the perfect way to get more liquids into him!<br />Each 4 pack box comes with a coupon for $1 off your purchase & if you fill out your info. on that very same coupon. they will mail you another coupon for $1.00 off a future purchase.  Not too shabby!  Yeah. this stuff is pretty darn expensive.  A fine example of you get what you pay for.<br />My only complaint is I would like the option of purchasing one or the other. as in no variety pack.<br />I highly recommend this for your kitties!  Six kitties tested. two kitty parents approve....
20302,B001BDDTB2,A1ST9PG26FSN2H,Thomas Paul,0/0,1228262400,The fish is better,The quality of the Petite Cuisine cat food is not the problem.  There is no question that the food is high quality.  There are no meat by-products and if you know what by-products are you will be happy about that. The problem is that my cats don't seem to like it nearly as much as the fish flavors.  The four cans have only two varieties and my cats weren't thrilled with either one.  In fact. two of my cats don't like these at all.  The sesame chicken is made up of thin strips of chicken which two of my four cats seem to think is tasty enough.  The chicken pot pie is liked by only one cat.  I think the other cats don't like it because it has too much liquid.  The liquid isn't a gravy but rather a watery broth and there is just too much of it.<br /><br />So before you buy this 24 pack size. you will definitely want to try the 4 pack to see if your cats like it.  If they do then this size pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so it is worth it. If they don't then you only lost a few dollars.
20307,B001BDDTB2,ADEZOPMPKK146,Will,0/0,1228262400,Kitty Yum Yum :0),My cat. PONCHO. loves this food. He's one of those especially finicky cats too. The food is not overprocessed and sure to please the most particular of cats. Overall. a gourmet cat food at a reasonable price. Meow.
20368,B001BDDTB2,AQLL2R1PPR46X,grumpyrainbow,1/2,1227139200,Great food for you kitties,This is great food and all my cats love it.  It's the perfect size for an adult cat to eat.  It looks like 'real' food and doesn't have all the junk normal cat food has.  I have also found that it does not make my cats sick when they eat it.  It's pricey. but when you consider how much better it is I think it's worth it for your pets.
20407,B001BDDTB2,A2DV48TSVVVO6V,Jesus is my Savior,0/2,1227657600,My cat gave these five stars...,My cat loved the chicken pot pie.  I was very skeptical. but she even ate the carrots!  Amazing.
20418,B001BDDTB2,A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,E. A. Jones movie buff,3/3,1228262400,good food. but may not please picky cats,After trying all the flavors I found that 2 of my cats love this food.  The 3rd cat. notoriously picky. will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them. but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in regular store bought food. which means you get more actual food.  Good for us. but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also. the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this.
20424,B001BDDTB2,AXA1OCK4146L9,Jay Levitt Real entrepreneurs breed butterfl...,2/2,1250380800,Slurp. It's gone.,I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13-year-old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food. and while he wouldn't touch any other brand. he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian. but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken/fish than anything I've seen - actual. identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well. and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors. but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.<br /><br />But: check out Joe's post about menadione.
20443,B001BDDTB2,A2YOPXZ6US5CPU,Nancleans,1/1,1325289600,Great food,This is our picky cats favorite food. I used to find it in some stores. but no longer. So glad Amazon carries the full line of Petite Cusine.
20456,B001BDDTB2,A2QDBOHV00NOR2,Wendy Johnston podlogic,1/1,1233878400,Cat's love it,I got this after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition. Feed your pet Right. The article identified protein rich. nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types. but LOVE the red snapper. tuna and shrimp. tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food. even if they are picky. like mine.
20460,B001BDDTB2,A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,JC Chupack,1/1,1229904000,Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict,My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine. I decided to give it a try with him. After all. they have some veggie content. which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First. I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does. but he's addicted. so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second. I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can. I don't care how much he likes it. I'm not serving it. Third. it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM. my cat usually begs for it. sniffs it. and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally. he will wolf it down immediately. So. consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food. and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box. in Chicken Pot Pie flavor. as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the soupy broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day. I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours. he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So. he was clearly hungry. but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So. I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later. I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding. and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry. and he ignored it steadily. Clearly. my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin. Snapper. Tuna & Sole. Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats. 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them. unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky. and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor. but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.
20461,B001BDDTB2,A10WN5CZWR6YKM,D. Reicosky artzebo,1/1,1229644800,petite cuisine. variety pack.,i do not like the smell of cat food.  this says it is people food for cats. and it looks just like ground up fish with alot of juice.  the cans are the little cans. same size as the fancy feast cans.  the real testament is from my cat.  she is oh so particular. even turning down many types of fancy feast and other things.  this petite cuisine however. she is madly in love with it.  she starts as soon as we get up. about 6am. she prances all around the kitchen meowing for her petite cuisine.  once she has eaten. we don't see her for the rest of the day. she goes off to sleep.  this is the first food in her life that she has felt compelled to make a fuss for.  i think it has to be a winner!
20469,B001BDDTB2,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,Stanley Runk Runkdapunk,1/1,1229212800,More Like 3 and a Half Stars I Suppose,Well. it's difficult to review something like this coz after all. I didn't eat any of it.  But I have three judges at home and as it stands. it's two to one on this food.  One cat likes it and the other wants nothing to do with it.  The dog loves it though!<br />It comes in those little tin cans like Fancy Feast. and you get an decent enough amount I suppose.  It seems a tad pricey. but that's for you to decide.<br />So there you have it-Approved by one dog and one cat.  But bear in mind the third cat is a VERY picky eater.
20473,B001BDDTB2,A18QNMVRG08DU5,a reader,1/1,1229040000,My cats like this,My cats seem to enjoy this food as much as their erstwhile favorite. Wellness wet food.  They are pretty fussy so I am pleased.  I also like the fact that the the ingredients seem to be nourishing (no by-products) although since some reviewers have mentioned a possibly dangerous ingredient. I think I will do a little more research before ordering this again.
20478,B001BDDTB2,A35VI0H5AFHOJ5,Sharon Isch,1/1,1228608000,3 cats give 5 stars to 5 out of 6 flavors but  should I?,This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors. I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of menadione sodium sulfite in pet food shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer. especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact. as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07. I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors.  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz. probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast. which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So. what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds. supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food. neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house. but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats. Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile. I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.
20482,B001BDDTB2,A1BEKAQQGP8CMF,Seth R,1/1,1228089600,Source of protein and hearty enough to serve as one meal,First of all. your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods. because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin. snapper. tuna. and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes. you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I>chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine. which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.
20487,B001BDDTB2,A250AXLRBVYKB4,Nathan Beauchamp ConsumerAdvocate,1/1,1227916800,Healthy food for cats,My two cats loved these Petite Cuisine chicken flavors. and that's where the rubber meets the road in cat food. Happily. the food itself is very healthy and does not contain garbage byproducts. It's not human food but it's darn close. My cats preferred the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2>Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin. Snapper. Tuna & Sole. Tuna & Shrimp)</a> which I also received. but they certainly didn't turn up their noses at the chicken flavor!<br /><br />My sole complaint is that the chicken-pot-pie variety is very watery. My cats did not seem to mind though.<br /><br />If you want a premium. healthy cat food that is full of the good stuff. this is a great option.

Each individual pop had Oriental Trading and a 1-800 phone  printed on the wrapper. I intended it as a gift and it was absolutely unsuitable. Had to return.
20494,B004X8TFZ6,ASHO96ZB8AL1Z,Lindsey R. Whitney,0/0,1315785600,Very tiny!,I know. I should have read the whole description before ordering these. but I thought they were the bite size cookies. and instead they are VERY MINI cookies. like smaller than MnM's.  It makes them a little hard to eat. and they are a huge mess for kids. but they taste good!
20510,B003PFUNU4,A16RINADS09S4E,stephanieinohio,1/1,1334188800,Very happy I purchased these!,April 12. 2012<br /><br />I am very happy that I decided to purchase these.  The shipping was super fast.  It said estimated shipping was going to be about 1.5 weeks but it took only four days!  The packaging was great and the products are pretty large; I live alone and I know they'll last me for quite some time.<br /><br />I have been on a low-card no sugar diet for about a month now with great results.  I'm allowed water. coffee (with minimal amounts of extras) and unsweetened tea (it's tolerable but it's much better with sugar).  However. the only thing I've really been missing is my McDonald's Vanilla Iced Coffee (Bummer).  I have been trying to find a way to recreate my own this past month but those non-dairy creamers have about 10 grams of carbs per 4 tsp - not happening!  I am not a huge fan these days of artificial sweetners but I was looking for something with low sugars/zero sugars and low carbohydrates.  I'm not using it in excess. only about one cup of coffee per day so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />I only opened one so far as I just got them in the mail today.  I'm trying to be patient and only open one at a time so they keep well.  I am hoping to use the raspberry for my iced tea and the others for coffee.  At the moment I'm only making hot coffee but I should be getting a Ninja food processor/blender in a couple of days and I'm hoping to blend up some amazing creations.<br /><br />It states to use about 1 oz per serving but I opened the Classic Caramel (I have read that many hate this one) but it's tolerable. it's probably not going to be my favorite but I like it enough to drink it. I only used 4 tsp of syrup in a travel mug.  It's not overly sweet as the originals may be but it's not bad and it's a great substitution!<br /><br />I'll update my feedback once I've opened a few more which should be a while. I'm also hoping I like all of them enough to make a repurchase in several months when these are gone.  I went to the Torani website and found tons of recipes so I'm hoping I can make something delicious!  I'm glad I didn't place myself on the auto ship because I don't think that I'll go through them fast enough but I will definitely be considering a repurchase!<br /><br />Does anyone know the nutritional info on the full-sugar ones?  I'd be interested to know!
20519,B003PFUNU4,A2C08D08AEQ98C,Leah1030 Leah1030,1/1,1289952000,Huge size and flavorful!,I ordered this variety pack and was shocked when they arrived at the door and each one is the size of a bottle of wine. Wow! It's going to take me a year to go through them all---unless I gift a couple of them. I was drinking a cup of coffee with cream and sugar substitute. prepared perfectly to my taste. Then decided to add a couple of spoonfuls of the Hazelnut. and wow it woke up the flavor of the coffee. It made the coffee so much more robust. The biggest problem will be picking a flavor to use. I've also seen these used as flavor in homemade ice cream. That's next on my list to try!
20529,B003PFUNU4,A13CNIUUEHG1UQ,Deb,0/0,1338768000,DELICIOUS!,YUM-M-M-M-M-MY!  Whether used in a protein shake or in morning coffee. this variety pack brings a smile to my face and comfort to my tummy.  Love the selection and love the price!
20539,B003PFUNU4,A11IXJ8M1JO296,mkayreagan marykay,0/0,1326672000,6 Great Flavors,I like every one of these syrups and the price is right. I really didn't want the raspberry but its very good. Served flavored cappuccinos to my Bible study group and they loved them too. especially the Irish Cream. My favorite is Hazelnut followed by Vanilla. Hard to find Torani where I live so. so I'm happy I can reorder on Amazon. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste as long as you don't overdo it on the quantity you use per beverage. It's great in yogurt too!
20546,B003PFUNU4,A3LZ304YAQPU2S,Heather A. Gunnerson,0/0,1298764800,Love!,We save lots of money using these instead of flavored coffee creamer from the grocery store. I love the raspberry for Italian sodas and in whipped cream for a great fresh berry topping. Chocolate is my least favorite because I'm a chocolate snob but I have made some decadent raspberry mochas with it. Great value- a small bottle is over $5 at my grocery store!
20551,B003PFUNU4,A2NVA630MHB4CE,RowiesMama,0/0,1284422400,I like this but...,This is a good variety. the Chocolate is as bad as everyone says it is. but the other flavors are great and gives my family and friends variety when over for a latte or steamer. My favorite is the hazelnut and i stick to it most of the time. its a good buy.
20552,B003PFUNU4,AXE5IJE72616G,Beach Books,2/4,1285891200,Torani SF Great Flavors.,Found out about this stuff on TheWorldAccordingToEggface and everything she uses this stuff in really tastes better.  I use it in protein shakes and protein sugar free low fat homemade ice cream.  It just adds a touch of flavor with no calories. sugar or fat. My favorite shake is using coffee. protein powder. dash of Any Torani Syrup. fat free milk and ice.  Yummo!!!  Thank you Torani. Thank you Eggface!!
20555,B003PFUNU4,A2V1KXRZRVXDED,SoldiersSweety,0/1,1303776000,Delicious,I love the sugar free. calorie/fat free syrups for my coffee.  I even put the Raspberry and Vanilla flavors in my diet soda.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's still a bit on the expensive side and I would really like to create my own variety pack and select the flavors I love most!  The variety pack is cheaper than buying the bottles individually. so I will just take what I get!
20572,B001PJQW70,A2613WC72IR7L1,Annie,0/0,1283040000,Tasty Treat for Dogs with Grain Allergies,My dog absolutely loves these treats.  He's allergic to wheat. corn. soy. chicken. pork and fish. so there aren't a lot of options to choose from. but he really and truly loves these.

20598,B004U8Z436,A1PHE5CJYOL22K,Kepaji,0/0,1314403200,Best Litter Ever Used,We have had cats for many years and this litter is the best by far of all the brands we tried.<br />I have found one trick to keeping this fom sticking to litterbox bags is to keep the plastic bag smooth on the bottom of box and litter clumps perfect every time.
20625,B0018CJYPG,AID54894HY443,Alan Schwartz,1/1,1335398400,Great For Dog With Allergies,My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy. and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill. and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly. and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?
20628,B0018CJYPG,A1GBEC0IZ5XJIE,Ben Olsen,1/1,1332806400,Looks like good stuff!,The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb. chickens. etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.
20632,B0018CJYPG,A3GLQSR6MTHXGL,Donna Kelly,1/1,1325808000,premium edge dog food,I've got 2 dogs and they love this food.  I also like when I order this dog food they ship it free to my house.
20634,B0018CJYPG,ANY74IVWZPZ3,L. Boileau Laura,1/1,1324252800,My dogs are doing great on this dog food!,Amazon has an excellent price on all the Premium Edge dog foods. I chose this brand after reviewing it on the dog food anaylsis websites. It has excellent quality ingredients. and best thing is my dogs LOVE it!!
20648,B0018CJYPG,A2JGWDPGYD5X0N,Ann Joy,1/4,1329955200,Not so great..Expiration date soon..,I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs. because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites. and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food. but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this. since one of my dogs will eat just about anything. while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good. so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And. I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11. 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon. even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little. but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing. and there is not even a smell that says eat me. I am food.  Could be cardboard. judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return. since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old. or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But. This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive. not as healthy. but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs. mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge. which they give  a paws down to!
20658,B00126AO48,AW1X82RDC2M3B,Mrs. Frisky,0/0,1236902400,Great Bacon!!,Terrific Bacon!  They offer many varieties. but this peppered version seems tastiest.  Great. prompt service from Burger's Smokehouse - and pricing that I appreciate:  shipping charges are included in the quoted price.  No extras to consider!
20666,B000MP84MO,A3FWJFPC486L99,E. Roehl,0/0,1342656000,Really good coffee,Kona blends are my favorite. but they are hard to find. supposedly due to a bad crop in Hawai'i.  I am just glad that I can find this anywhere and the price is decent.
20685,B003ZNXCKE,AXRZNVBDMHDKD,D. Rogers,1/1,1314835200,More of a treat,Good product. but more of a treat for my dogs.  It took them just a matter of minutes to have the SmartBone gone.  Maybe good for dogs that are not big chewers.  I was hoping for something more digestible but as sturdy as rawhides
20717,B0001IVR8A,AP9EMN6V9SCON,Joseph's Mommy Want to maintain a &34;green...,1/2,1230422400,DELICIOUS!,I was absolutely thrilled to be able order these as unique stocking stuffers this year. But. was I the only one who saw the movie Serendipity in my family? These packets of Frozen Hot Chocolate are just as delicious as everyone (in the other reviews) says they are. (Which makes me doubly happy that I ordered them!) Before they even arrived. I thought how silly I was to only order one set and went back and ordered more. My son and I just had to try it out before we gave these away for the holidays. It is even great mixed with ice cream. My only complaint is that the shipping is quite steep for these lightweight packets. Otherwise. I am a very happy customer!
20723,B0001IVR8A,A16EQ0G9Q79LLN,K. Trollope Net Lurker,2/4,1189641600,The Absolute Bomb for Chocolate Lovers,I purchased 2 of these as gifts for online friends who love chocolate - they absolutely love them.
20732,B0062MAJPG,AO1HIVTUCQZQ2,Mon,1/1,1323907200,Great for mochas and hot chocolate!,I looked everywhere for this when I heard this flavor was coming out.  I get the peppermint mochas at Starbucks during the holidays so I was very excited when I got the Tassimo email that this flavor was available for the holidays.  Of course when I went to buy it. the Tassimo site had these on backorder and even Amazon.com didn't have them available.  I finally found some at my local Bed. Bath. & Beyond and bought every package they had (only 3).  These are sooo delicious and I plan to look for more so I can stock up and have them even after the holidays are over.  This can be made with other variations as well.  I made it as a mocha with the chocolate and espresso discs but then also added a milk disc to it.  It was delicious and more of a latte with the chocolate peppermint flavor.  I used it as a hot chocolate for my kids by leaving out the espresso disc and only using the chocolate peppermint one included in this package and a milk disc from a different package I had.  It was so good and the kids loved it.  If you like the peppermint mochas at Starbucks. then get this limited edition set. This is one of my favorites now and I wish they offered it year round.
20755,B000SDMFC0,A13MF5C95TLFIG,TrailRunR WayneS,3/3,1249948800,Just good coffee...,I like this coffee. it has a little more bite than the super creama but all in all a good drink. It may be a little more suited to milk base drinks. When it is all said and done Lavazza comes throuth again with their 100% Arabica blend. Super Creama is still my favorite of the Lavazza brand. but this may be my second choice.
20769,B000SDMFC0,A205R84NP7VL4A,Jacko,0/0,1342051200,FOR $30.00 THERE IS NOT COMPLAIN FOR ME !,THIS WILL EASILY BEAT ANY STARTBUCKS COFFEE OUT THERE.<br /><br />TRUE BARGAIN IF YOU ASK ME ! GET A BAG ! AND TREAT YOURSELF RIGHT !

They are reliable. and have a round. pleasing flavor. Not burnt. not acidic. I like them more than the other Lavazza options in 2.2 lb bags.<br /><br />I use these beans with a superautomatic espresso machine. Nice crema. Nice flavor. The crema lasts for more than 5 minutes.

Although I won't do Ghost Chili Hot.<br />I really enjoy it because it is hot enough for me but not too much.<br />It has great taste as well. Not too vinegary as some other hot sauces are.<br /><br />For the size of the bottle. this is a pretty decent price too.<br />Was received in a timely manner too.<br />Will be re-purchasing when this bottle runs out.
20830,B001EPPYME,ANTWFMQSZLEJF,CLP C,0/1,1233964800,Not impressed!,I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process. but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.
20836,B0052U2I3A,A2KS9M3J12XFYQ,Quinbould knowledgebuff,2/5,1324080000,Awful aftertaste,I love white chocolate.  This one didn't taste anything like white chocolate usually tastes.  It had a flowery mixed with off milk taste that I found offensive and had difficulty getting out of my mouth.  It was expensive so I managed to get it edible by melting the block and mixing it with a substantial potion of pure cocoa butter and pure vanilla.  I can not recommend this product at all.  I was shocked considering that Callebaut does make good chocolate. but not this one.
20840,B002GWH5OY,A1GXONX1GZ5X5J,Aaron J Dykstra,0/0,1259020800,Mild and flavorful,I ordered this in mid October 2009.  The bags were dated February 2009.<br /><br />A friend of mine had visited this region of Guatemala and had brought me back some of the coffee beans from his trip.  I was astounded by how the coffee lacked the bitterness you can find in most other coffees.  There also seems to be some hints of cherries or some other nutty/fruity flavor.  I have used multiple grind settings when using this (drip coffee maker) and found that it tolerates a very fine grind well.  The looser grinds and small amounts of the coffee can leave this weak though.<br /><br />Highly recommend this coffee.
20841,B005LKRCSM,A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J,Sue Katz Honey Bee,0/0,1342137600,Check ingredients listed first. then be prepared to clean the canister,The listed ingredients at Amazon are correct but incomplete. Item also contains beef base (FIRST ingredient) & MSG (THIRD ingredient). neither of which we will eat in our household. Those ingredients were omitted on the product page by accident. they say. Really?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Moreover. the package we received contained crusted seasoning on the container. and the package was dusty & yucky. I literally had to wash the canister & use a bit of elbow grease before even reading the ingredient list! This is a food item. for gosh-sakes. Should have repackaged and refused delivery right then & there.<br /><br />A bad experience with Amazon with this one. that's for certain. Would have never purchased in-store. much less handled or brought into my home. I can't believe Amazon is shipping food products in this condition. I'll definitely reconsider my purchase of grocery items here.

However. they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges.  These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles.  We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes. but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.

Several folks have commented on the price; remember that there are a number of vendors selling this product on Amazon. and many of them do overcharge. both for the item as well as the shipping.  Amazon's own price is EXCELLENT compared to my local supermarket.<br /><br />This cereal is not too sweet. and quite filling.  I'm on Weight Watchers. and the points value is quite reasonable.  The added raisins. dates. and nuts contribute to the texture. which I find very satisfying (a little chewy. a little crunch ... ).<br /><br />Really good stuff!

It's very light and refreshing. and decaf so you can drink it any time of day.  Plus. buying it 6 boxes at a time saves you money. and it's good enough to drink that much of it. :)

I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.

Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store. but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups. so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon.

They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a lite version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing. but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do.

Also. his breath has been noticeably fresher since he has been having these. So far. best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs. Can't vouch on the benefit of nutritional value of these. but the vet says our mini is in great shape ...right where he is suppose to be.
21081,B002QWP89S,A30COJ9SQH4SVZ,playboyesquiere playboyesquiere,0/0,1345507200,not bad,So far so good. My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot.
21085,B002QWP89S,A33HGS0F6NVBRA,C. Kinerd,23/23,1232409600,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,I have been using Greenies for years. including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However. we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath. teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as well earned treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4. 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula. the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me. your dogs will love them.
21115,B002QWP89S,A3M4QZCQV0GOUY,Barbara L. Lutnick Bonnie,0/0,1343692800,doggy chews,If you need to keep your dogs mouth and gums clean and healthy. this will easily do the job.  My dog looks forward to this treat!
21116,B002QWP89S,A1UM2Y9A9TCJXU,Michael Sena,0/0,1343520000,Just Okay. nothing else,Updates: One Day. One Week. Two Weeks. One Month. Three Months. Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today. even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund. a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy. and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky. but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide. I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up. but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure. some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age. but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product. but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from. but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a U and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less heavy.  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either. other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me. because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work. though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.

We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.

The picture shows a count of 96 bones. but I only got a box of 45.  I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz. so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones. but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad. but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift. so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs. a Chihuahua. MinPin and Shichon love them!

If your dog doesn't take to it right away. have some patience. My own dog took it in strides at first--she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her breath (which is never very minty fresh). but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way.

As expensive as they are. I feel my animals are well worth it.  This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However. I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people - put the product in a pouch and call it a day.

Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her breath is nicer. too. since we started giving her Greenies.<br /><br />We give her one every day or so and she will carry it around 'protecting' it for an hour or so before settling down and devouring it. We tried other brands but she will only accept the best. She is terrified of thunderstorms and will come out from under the bed only if we offer her her favorite treat: a Greenie.

21359,B002QWP89S,A2D3JYUBKYXABF,Channelle,0/0,1307145600,Absolutely fabulous,I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth. and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie. my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day. but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said. Almost three. And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. No. I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four. one being the best and four being the worst. her teeth were a perfect one. which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight. so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh. her teeth are white and tartar free. and she's a very happy dog.

21385,B002QWP89S,ARCLASA61DB6M,J. S. Thomas,0/0,1298851200,My Lab's favorite bedtime treat,I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously. if he could skip. he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat. Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay. but I like how they freshen his breath. clean his teeth. & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits. but none I've tried so far have that tail-wagging drool factor which. to be honest. makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)

My dog had been eating canned food and her teeth looked terrible.  I tried a couple of teeth whitening treats and toys. but Bailey would have nothing to do with them.  Then I found Greenies and she loves them.  Once she left a couple puddles of saliva on the floor as I was getting out a greenie for her. she was salivating so much.  Her teeth look so much better now and her breath is great.

21487,B002QWP89S,ASALOFU6V48J3,MES,0/0,1258070400,GRRRRRREAT!,I have no personal experience with Greenies but my dog loves them.  Her rating is grrrreat!
21490,B002QWP89S,A158Y8GYX115I3,dog fanatic dog fanatic,0/0,1255737600,My dog would do anything for Greenies,My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him. never made him sick. and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day. I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies. I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.
21493,B002QWP89S,A1ENZK86F1VE8P,Kimberly Hart Southern Belle,0/0,1254268800,My doggie hates everything but loves these!,My doggie goes crazy when he hears the box being opened. He has sensitive teeth and doesnt like hard stuff. These are perfect. I started using these after getting his teeth cleaned. I give him one every 2-3 days. Keeping his teeth clean.

21507,B002QWP89S,AUXA0DN06MFBF,M. Kathleen Romanovich mynxr,0/0,1234310400,Papillions Love Greenies!,Our Papillions love Greenies!  They help keep the tartar under control.  This breed is notorious for bad tartar build up on their teeth and having to have dentals twice a year.  With using the Greenies daily. they only have to have a dental once a year.  This saves us over $400/year.
21526,B002QWP89S,A3NIW2COUTH4R3,M. Nygaard,2/2,1321142400,Full of worms,When we opened the box. we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot.
21536,B002QWP89S,A2974R9BTPZPOJ,DoKi,0/1,1264809600,Just as pictured,Nice to have a box to store the greenies. but the lid doesn't really fit back on once you open it. it's really flimsy plastic.  Inside is a ziploc bag of greenies.
21563,B002QWP89S,A22JW7FCT9ASWE,Allie,24/47,1253318400,Be careful with wheat gluten,I'll admit. I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the 1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky. so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation. and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So. I have not seen a problem with this product. but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as gluten intolerancein humans. but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough. but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.
21566,B002QWP89S,A2W94QQDJY47R7,lilyponds,1/6,1309132800,Greenies Made My Dog SICK,Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time. I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece. it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick. you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!
21582,B002QWP89S,A74SHV5ZD3RLT,R. Ellis Bobby,2/2,1271548800,Great product and free shipping to AK.  Can't beat that!,I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular. ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing. they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny. it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet. they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older. he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them. ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time. he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours. he'll love them.
21614,B002BCD2GO,A3P1T03UHU5QZB,Y. Howard,44/45,1265587200,Heavenly,After reading how good Agave Nectar is for you and a number of excellent reviews. I decided to take the plunge and order Madhava's Agave Nectar Light in the 46 oz. bottles. pack of two.  Not having a clue as to how good or bad this product was going to taste. I was very nervous and wondered if I had made a wise decision or big mistake.  I couldn't wait to try it and was delightfully surprised.  In tea. it tastes sweeter than sugar.  In smoothies. it's sensational.  Even a spoonful is wonderful.  My husband loves it in his oatmeal and I like to mix it with dehydrated coconut and raw cacao nibs for a real treat.  I could not be more pleased with my discovery!
21652,B002BCD2GO,A1PV8FNUPIA3LX,DAVID D BRELAND,0/0,1350691200,Great Sweetener,Hard to find this size in my local retailers...  Price is similar to what I was paying for a much smaller size.

21699,B0025UCAO2,A21PYTVY69GE4G,TheSheri,3/4,1285459200,Easy Peasy!,It's great to have these little packets.  As I eat in a galley for my three meals. I don't want to lug around a heavy bottle of ranch dressing with me.  Now I can just take a small packet.  Hooray!
21706,B0009WJ7IA,A3TLCSTMCZ0XX6,Kris Kris,0/0,1320969600,Tasty and good for you,Our dog enjoys these better than any other hard biscuit we've tried.  They are no longer available locally. so we tried another decent brand and he just looks at us like Hey. where are my CA Naturals??  So. I'll get them from Amazon.
21712,B005DVVB9K,R2HLGNHVIDQ0G1,Susan K. Schoonover Sue Yingling,4/7,1319587200,Issues Resolved In Second Basket,I received this gift basket Monday which was an unseasonably warm late October day here in Colorado.  My family and I tried the chocolate covered peanuts that same evening and though delicious they were melted together in one lump!  Same experience with the chocolate coated pretzels.  The chocolate covered raisins also tasted great and fortunately had stayed intact with no ill effects from being too warm.  There's a variety of truffles. covered marshmallows. graham crackers etc included I have not yet opened or tasted.  All the  treats appear to be of very high quality though the quantities are quite small which may be a good thing for those of us watching our waistlines.  The actual basket the treats come in is a little cheap looking but I did decide to keep it to make up my own gift basket for someone in the future.  At a cost of around $40 I don't consider this item to be an exceptional value.<br />PS  I took a star off this gift basket since the more I look at it the less impressed I am.  For some strange reasons a rice krispie type bar with a bit of chocolate was placed in a box for flan. some truffles were placed in one of those single serve size cereal boxes for sugar pops and some dark chocolate pieces were in a Royal Jello box.  I don't really think I would want to give as a gift something with this odd packaging.<br />UPDATE:  ig4U contacted me and sent me another basket to review.  This second basket did NOT contain melted chocolates or strange recycled packages.  Based on the second basket I received this item would make an attractive. respectable gift for a chocolate lover.
21721,B001SAVXMK,A29W700R7V91WU,Jeanie tweetybird,0/0,1349827200,Hard To Fine,I bought about 18 of Emeril's Vegetable Stock. I can't fine it at all around where I live. Also don't save a dollar and buy the cheaper one's you will be sorry. Emeril's stock doesn't have much fat in the stock broth.
21723,B001EPQA5O,A3RBGEV4IHL1XM,Giant Panda,0/0,1337040000,Tastes great. but no expiration date,My 4 jars were shipped in lots of bubble wrap. it took me a while to open.  Anyways. it is real artichoke spread. made in Italy.  Claims all natural ingredients and no preservatives.  My first shock is the size of the jars.  4.5 oz ain't much - think baby food.  The other thing I didn't like is that nowhere on any of the jars could I find an expiration date!!  Looks like Amazon took individual jars not labeled for resale from a large box.  Maybe it is OK to sell stuff in Italy without a date. but I am sure some law is being violated selling it here in the US.  Anyways. I opened a jar and it tastes OK. so I'm keeping it this time. but have doubts about re-ordering in the future.<br /><br />My recommendation for Amazon: if you want to get into the online food-selling business. please make sure that not only the products are labeled properly. but the expiration date is noted on the product page.
21729,B001DDH1W8,A22XHFR4VX2EZH,Gordon R. Carmichael furclan,0/0,1316131200,Nice. but not what I expected.,This garlic-flavored oil is nice. but does not have the strength of garlic I had hoped for. As a bread-dipping oil. it just does not produce that tang of garlic I prefer. If you like only the merest hint of garlic. this may be for you.
21738,B000KV61FC,A1SLLKDKCZ5IPL,C. Guariglia,2/2,1221091200,Buried Treasure Forever!,The idea is basically a good one. however. my large Papillon (all 20 lbs of her) could not figure this one out-no matter how hard she tried.  Food is a HUGE motivate her but unless I helped her. eventually she would just carry this toy around and just give up.  I will say that the Tug-A-Jug had ME trained!
21739,B000KV61FC,A36DVV6R3PSIQA,D. TAYLOR animal mom,2/2,1219017600,My Pugs love this!,I bought two of these for my Pug puppies.  Wasn't sure if first if they would get the hang of it but it took no time at all.  Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories). I fill these with Cheerio's (or some frozen sliced carrrots or peas) and a few larger milkbones and they go nuts.  The larger milkbones are added just to make it a little tougher.  It's a great learning toy or busy toy - hence the name.  All I have to ask my little Puggies is. do you want your bottle and that's all they need.  We couldn't live without it.  Oh and I've had ours for probably a year and a half and we're not even close to needing to replace them.
21743,B000KV61FC,A3EVQBMHOO8PT4,Kendra Rice,2/2,1186272000,Tug-a-jug is a hit!,My dogs love this toy!! Of course. they love it more when there are treats in it but they love to play with it even when it's empty! Though if you have more than one dog. I would suggest one for each. The bottle is made from 'bullet proof' material and is really hard and could cause some damage if it's being swung around and fought over. Over all though. I am really happy with this purchase. It's great to watch the dogs figure this out!!
21745,B000KV61FC,ARE2M3POLXNNG,Cyndia,2/2,1180051200,great way to feed!,I love this toy for my shih tzu! at first he was confused by it but now it takes him 30 min - hr to get all his kibbles out of the thing. I dont even use his food bowl anymore..<br /><br />he even runs around with it around the house...
21748,B000KV61FC,AEU40RYOIEKFV,ChiNovice,1/1,1345248000,ATTENTION: This toy is DANGEROUS for your dog!,Our dog chewed through ate the vanilla infused rope.  Ropes do not show on x-rays and ultra sound.  The dog was vomiting up to 15 times a day.  Day 3 - our dog could not walk any more. Luckily our vet convinced us to do exploratory surgery and found the rope knot in our dog's intestines.  It is a very hard knot that will tear the intestines.  If not for this surgery. our dog would had died from the obstruction.
21755,B000KV61FC,A219MIY6TLFCPP,Leela's mom,1/1,1338508800,Great busy toy!,I got this toy on Amazon recommendations.  This toy has been true to form.  It has kept my 5 month old puppy engaged while I am busy preparing dinner.  I put her dog food in it and she love it. Great toy!!
21756,B000KV61FC,A2P0M5NZJD2H5N,kniymc,1/1,1338508800,keeps 'em busy!,My dog (cocker spaniel) has separation anxiety and one of the tactics i use to distract him from my leaving the house is his busy buddy tug-a jug toys.  His first one lasted about a year. and we used it every day. sometimes two to three times.  The threads on the bottom of the screw-off bottle eventually all broke off (i believe there is a picture of what it did on the item description already) and we needed another one.  So i bought 2.  It is a good toy that i will continue to give my dog. as it effectively keeps him busy and engaged.
21760,B000KV61FC,A14OJWHQDXKACI,kurt faulhaber,1/1,1332892800,Smart Siberian Husky,At first this was a great toy. lasted forever.  but then the smart husky figured out how to unscrew the cap. it was all over then.
21770,B000KV61FC,A1A3H0YT9UO7V8,Sofiya,1/1,1327276800,excellent,The toy keeps the dog busy for a long while. He loves it. He likes to play with it even without the treats sometimes.
21774,B000KV61FC,ALRH15WRTMQGT,beliz,1/1,1325635200,Very Good,My 90lbs pure Lab gets his one meal in this. He works on it till he eats the last piece of his kibble. This toy makes him tired. which we need if we are not at home :)
21805,B000KV61FC,AWL6I61JUHCY2,Brad C,1/1,1300233600,My dog loves this thing,My dog Sawyer even as a puppy took right to it.  He drains it pretty quickly. but we fill it with kibble thats different than his standard so its not too many treats.  Its fun to watch him play with it as well. since you can see him focus and think about it.  I recommend this to someone with a puppy that loves to think and do things.
21810,B000KV61FC,A1K3AX86G7NM8K,Christine L. Bridges,1/1,1298505600,Keeps dog busy,Dog broke the hard plastic the first day by slamming it around by the rope so we have to tape it up everytime we refill. Dog does enjoy. carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent breakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him.
21823,B000KV61FC,A21XJ41S13ARMS,MG,1/1,1288483200,Good entertainment,My puppy is a big time chewer. We give him his dinner in this a few times a week and it keeps him (and us) entertained. We do take it away from him as soon as he's done with all the food though. because I can tell the rubber end wont stand up if we let him go to town on it. Still other toys don't last a day and we're getting good use out of this.
21828,B000KV61FC,A1TB29GN113T77,Melissa with a cocker spaniel,1/1,1279670400,My dog's favorite way to eat!,As other people have noticed this isn't something that you should leave your dog alone with all day.  Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs. my sister had a 4lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the medium/large size toy.  My dogs are a 25lb cocker and a 35lb mix so I cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs.  If the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it.  Also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so I don't mind.
21836,B000KV61FC,A1QX27BPPGMUWV,Jennifer L. Piette Dachshund Mama,1/1,1264204800,Hours of fun!,My dachshund dog. Barney. ABSOLUTEY LOVES THIS TOY.  He loves for us to put dog food kibble in it. and then he entertains himself for hours.  He is very crafty in that he knows exactly how to get the cookies out of the jug.  He rolls it until he can get it against a solid surface and then he flips it upside down and gets the cookies out.  This toy is great. because I have two dogs. and they usually are always fighting to share toys. but the other dachshund. Cooper. doesn't like this toy. so Barney can have it all to himself.  Strongly recommend this toy!
21849,B000KV61FC,A19TKARML7720I,indybelle,1/1,1262563200,Tug-a-jug gets my dog's approval,I bought this for my one year old sheltie for Christmas and he LOVES it.  I put the Premier buddy berrys inside and they work quite well. as he can smell them through the holes in the toy. He's learned to stand it up and knock it over to get the treats to come out.  It's his new favorite toy and he drags it around everywhere.  It keeps him occupied for quite a while.
21856,B000KV61FC,A2HPF56C5C13I1,Nina nal001,1/1,1256256000,Well Made - But My Dogs Had Zero Interest,My corgi's are food obsessed and love their Kongs.  I was hoping that this toy would keep them occupied.  But. even though I put some high value treats in it. my dogs had no interest.  From my corgis' POV. this is a * item. but I gave it *** because it seems well made.
21870,B000KV61FC,A2QHCF0OYJ2N33,Jackie,1/1,1246233600,Pretty good occupier,Even though my dog chewed off the rubber rope. he still loves it. Great toy.
21887,B000KV61FC,A1YXK5KQ17DQM8,S. Bria,1/1,1231459200,Paws Up for this Toy!,While one of my goldens has no time for this toy (she is a princess who doesn't like to work for her food). my male LOVES his tug-a-jug! He will work at it for an hour until all the kibble is dispensed. You can actually see the wheels turning as he figures it out. and he is pooped when he's done. Great for body and brain. Only caveat: use this toy on carpet-- it is really noisy on a bare floor!
21888,B000KV61FC,AAW1F34LB5KY6,m39,1/1,1231200000,Fritzi Luv's It!,The Tug A Jug is a great dog toy.our mini doxie Fritzi needs a 12 step program cause he is on the Jug all the time. It has become his favorite toy and spend hours trying to get every last bit of treat out of it. He is exhasted as its quite the work out and needs a nap after wards. The only problem was the Tug part of it.it lasted about five minutes as he chewed right through that.but really you dont need it as you can put in larger treats mixed in with little ones and it works just fine.
21891,B000KV61FC,A1JUO3LV5UK4N0,firefly,1/1,1221609600,I love this toy...,I bought this toy for my dog to keep him busy while I run out the door to work.  He used to get upset when I left. but now he knows he will get this to play with.  He figured out really quickly how to use it and it keeps him entertained for at least 10-15 minutes while I escape.  It is very easy to clean.  One thing I wanted to point out is that the small is rather large.  My collie is huge and he uses the small.  I think the large would be too big for him.  I just put about a quarter of a cup in it although the small holds about 2 cups.  I guess if you wanted to feed a very large dog an huge meal you might need a large. but then it might be too heavey for the dog to play with.
21897,B000KV61FC,A2TXHG9O3F3S0I,J. Malit Jake's Mom,1/1,1206576000,Amazing feeding tool!,This is a wonderful toy and feeding tool. This keeps my 33-lb/4-month-old puppy busy for a good 20 minutes and after he's eaten all the food. he can chew on the rope. It's easy to clean. which is a BIG plus! This is a wonderful alternative to the Buster Cube. I also have the small Twist and Treat and both are great toys to keep him occupied.
21905,B000KV61FC,A27ZFVCM1TG86I,Ruth,1/1,1196899200,The Forever Toy,My dog is a mixed breed Corgi/Beagle/Terrier.  We have spend hundreds of dollars on toys for him in his 11mths. of life.  He even bit through his 3 Kong's.  This is the only toy that has lasted.  He ripped the rope off after a few days. but this toy is still perfect.  He gets bored eating out of his bowl so now he plays with this and it's the only way he eats his food.  We put his alloted kibble and some smelly treats and he can play with it all day.  I was worried at first. because he was chewing the plastic bottle.  Then I saw that it was made of bullet proof plastic and he's only scratched it.  I wish they would make more indistructable toys because this is really his only one.
21912,B000KV61FC,A23K1SOLRMB2I3,Miguel,3/4,1233964800,Lasted 5 minutes. item not as pictured,My dog chewed up the rope that stops up the bottle into dangerously large pieces in a manner of minutes.  Note that in the Medium/Large photos for this item the stopper appears to be an actual purple and white rope. but the item I received had the solid purple soft rubber rope that appears in the Small photos.  This design is completely unsuited for even moderately powerful chewers.  I never would have bought this item had the photographs been accurate.
21956,B000KV61FC,A58F10T4OE58C,S. Montgomery green dad,5/5,1199923200,Great toy but frustrates my dog,This toy keeps our Boston Terrier entertained for a long time.  We don't give it to her all the time to keep it new and interesting.  It is not easy to get the food out of the toy. which really frustrates her.  She'll start barking at it and going at it harder.  Other reviewers said their dogs got the hang of it quickly and were able to beat the system. but I don't see that happening with our dog.  It is still a bit of randomness with how the food comes out. so what worked for the dog one time. might not the next.  You can make it harder or easier depending on the size and shape of food you use.
21978,B000KV61FC,A2HC5L2GQ31VLP,E. Donaldson,0/0,1310688000,Amazing,I just got this toy for my 1.5 yo German Shepherd. He's a big chewer. and true to the breed's intelligence. and I have been looking for something to keep him occupied when I have to leave the house. This is it. I put a hand full of training treats in it. and it keeps him occupied for over an hour. I am slightly worried about the durability. but so far it's stood up to full grown GSD which is the true test for any toy in my mind. Well worth the money for any smart/curious dog.
21980,B000KV61FC,A3III07Y9VJI8Q,leslie,0/0,1310688000,Good for tiny treats or kibble,This is a nice change of pace for my dog from the kongs. Lately. everyone has been making their treats smaller and easier to get out of the kongs. so I'll definitely be using this more. I have a 55 lb border x who is a chewer with separation anxiety. This is a nice addition to the collection.
22004,B000KV61FC,A1RFDHX5W6HB74,W. Kepner,0/0,1296259200,OK toy if you remove the rope for safety..,Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand. I work at a vet). Its an expensive. invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope. but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes. bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy. yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking. but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers. as I don't think this would stand up to pits. rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble.
22011,B000KV61FC,AL8WV8BE0ISZQ,Rott Lover,0/0,1294531200,Can be dangerous,I have purchased many Premier brand products and liked them. especially the Busy Buddy dog toys.  However. the Tug-a-jug is not one of them.  The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged.  My dog stopped playing with it due to that.  The  tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it. it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture. walls. etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.  Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!  I did buy it in 2009 but my dog hardly ever played with it so I am not sure how long they would last if a dog played with it frequently.  Premier has so many other wonderful dog toys to chose from.
22031,B000KV61FC,A12RIBH3FE09MH,Temple Naff harleyridingirl,0/0,1282608000,great dog toy,I got this toy for my two pomeranians and the boy just loves it. He has a high food drive anyway but just put some good smelling treats in this and he will play with it until they all come out. It's easy to load with just a few but if you put their whole day's food in it you have to hold you hand over the rubber ball so they won't spill out.
22041,B000KV61FC,A1Z7VYGEN8GC88,LudaChris,0/0,1279843200,Strong chewers whipped it in an hour,My dog just got mad they couldn't get the treats out and ripped the rope right out.<br />He's a pretty strong chewer but not extraordinary. He's only a 70 lb coonhound.<br />Just an FYI to ya'll. I thought it was a little difficult for them to get treats but maybe my dogs aren't the smartest.<br />Anyway. the search continues for the perfect dog toy.
22050,B000KV61FC,A39IVA3LNXAED8,Valerie S. Crider Loves Animals 1959,0/0,1271203200,Great purchase!,Was reccommended by the Vet and ordered it right away.  Dog loves it and keeps her busy for hours.
22091,B000KV61FC,ARN85DCNU1YE4,Diane Dogmama,0/0,1230854400,Quite the workout - but maybe a bit too difficult,<span class=tiny> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer. so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit. so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug. so I didn't buy those.
22094,B000KV61FC,A9B2T9WEUIWHE,S. Starr,0/0,1222387200,Not bad but could've been better,It's a good concept. but the rope part of the tug a jug is not as durable as I thought.  My Corgi/Australian Shepherd puppy cleanly separated the rope into 2 pieces so now it's just a jug.
22100,B000KV61FC,A31OFS7ZGB5S5T,Bohemian Wifey,0/0,1209859200,Rope was chewed in one day.,Our pit mix loves to chew especially when bored.  We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard. sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something. maybe then this toy would work for our boy.
22103,B000KV61FC,A2NZAFS0OQAZNX,Michael K. Diamond,0/0,1206748800,busy buddy,I loved the tug a jug it keeps our puppy busy during meal times.  He figured it out on the first day but still enjoys it.  We don't use it every day but save it for those times when we want to keep him busy during special meals.  I would highly recommend this for bored. destructive dogs.
22123,B000KV61FC,AJNJI8L53U59F,Addy,1/2,1336435200,Good in theory. not in practice,I got this because everyone says it's great for your dog to play with when he's alone. My dog has several treat dispensing toys to keep him busy: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B11L46>Atomic Treat Ball Interactive Dog Toy. 3-Inch</a> . <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG>Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball . 5 Inches . Colors may vary</a>. and Kong Puppy Kong Toy Medium. He does really well with all of them. the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him. though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky. the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way. but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work. you have to tip the jug to get anything out and. well. my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work.
22140,B000KV61FC,A1GT5JFPQPT8AC,Louis Gamerman,1/2,1265155200,Too heavy and only for food motivatewd dogs,I bought this based on a friend's recommendation. but was disappointed.<br /><br />Although I checked the sizing chart. the item seemed too big and heavy for my dog. I recommend going one size down from what they recommend.<br /><br />Also - although my dog loves playing with her stuff-a-ball toy. she will barely go near this thing. So - the one doesn't necessarily imply like for this item.<br /><br />I suspect this would work best for a dog with strong food motivation. My doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />As a toy. it's not much fun. unless a dog really wants food badly and is willing to put a lot of work into it.
22142,B000KV61FC,A13Q38GXKS1XXV,J. Morgan,1/2,1262908800,Short Lived,The Tug-A-Jug is a cleverly designed toy that does a good job of entertaining/occupying a dog. but my 85 pound Weimaraner destroyed the largest model inside of a few hours. It's also noisy for indoor use.
22143,B000KV61FC,A3I4F0I0XJ6VR8,Jo Marine Wife & Teacher,1/2,1261180800,Terrible!,This was a waste of money!  The plastic rope cracked and broke within a couple of days.  Our little pup barely touched it.
22159,B000KV61FC,A2JGWDPGYD5X0N,Ann Joy,5/9,1210118400,Three Dogs...No want...,I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However. none of my three dogs had any interest in them. even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer. one is a medium chewer. and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also. it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple. and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week. and I keep giving them the toys. but no luck.  I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot. and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle. for nothing...<br />  Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs. and not me!  I paid quite a bit for 2 of them. and I<br />need to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?
22164,B000KV61FC,A242HDAB0EFGYN,Ashley,0/1,1336348800,Destructible,I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him.  I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews.  He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys.  For this reason I thought he would love this toy.  Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two.
22182,B000KV61FC,A3QYH2BD88R9ZY,BuddyDog,0/1,1325030400,Clever Idea. BUT ....,The rope idea doesn't really work ( well it works 1 time). It actually impedes the dispensing of the treats after your dog yanks it out - now the treats are stuck inside until the human pushes the rope back in.<br /><br />Would NOT purchase again!
22230,B000KV61FC,A1VFIBK330IT2B,mengster,1/3,1342656000,waste of money!!!,my dog loved it at first but an hour later the plastic bottle cracked!! maybe this toy should be kept indoors only :(
22236,B000KV61FC,A2NYSVILSHKOML,dee63,0/2,1342396800,Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug,Pretty cool idea.  Lab loved it for a while...then it broke when it got tossed onto the driveway - bye. bye. toy!
22240,B000KV61FC,A3UD2RQCVBAJJG,Barbara Feliciano,0/2,1230249600,Don't Buy,This toy did not last. I have a boxer and he chewed the rope off the jar.
22241,B000KV61FC,A3985TKM4B1B3X,TW,1/4,1245801600,$10 thrown away,My dog destroyed the rubber cord in 5 minutes (worse yet. swallowed it). got very nervous trying to get the treats out and almost attacked my other dog for trying to get it from her (which she never before did). I had to take her toy away and wish i could get my money back. $10 is not a cheap tog toy. so it could be at least durable. I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave. but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested. And that would cost much more... Better stick to Kong toys. the only ones so far my chewing dog cannot destroy it!
22254,B000KV61FC,AZJXAQJZD7ZX8,Henstina27 Gail,2/2,1319846400,THE toy to keep your dog busy,We got this toy to keep my 6 month puppy busy when we went to work. It's a great toy for dogs that inhale their food and need some stimulation so they keep out of trouble. My dog is not a light chewer so I was worried that he would chew this to pieces but after a couple of months this toy remains intact. LOVE IT!
22271,B000KV61FC,A1TWDGF3B8MUL3,E. Weisbauer Emily,2/2,1254700800,Awesome toy but maybe not appropriate for apartment dwellers,My bloodhound mix loves. loves. loves this toy. She walks around carrying it from the rope until she can settle into her favorite corner to go to work. The only problem is that we live in an apartment building with hardwood floors.  The hard plastic hitting the floor is definitely LOUD and our dog likes to throw it up the air for added effect. which creates an even louder THUD.  I would definitely recommend this toy but if you have neighbors downstairs. they might hate you.
22273,B000KV61FC,A21V2KRG4Y74PQ,Thoughtful reviewer,2/2,1240790400,Fantastic way to feed your dog,I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom. pour the kibble in. and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot. you probably don't need the big one.
22308,B0041GHV8I,A1XMB52F1KZ4PK,Allison C,0/0,1329609600,What Peas Are Supposed to Be,This is an amazing product. I've spent so much time trying to find a decent baby food. but I was so disappointed. Some products simply looked inedible and I'd never want to give them to my baby. Then I came across NurtureMe. The peas actually look like peas! Imagine that. They pop with a bright green color and smell just like fresh peas. My baby loves them and so do I. I've tested Sprout. Happy Baby. and Earths Best. but Nutureme is the only baby food I use.
22321,B002FTLXYG,AJK58JRZ0Y63G,Robin Phillips,1/1,1335916800,What a money saver,We own an Australian Shepard who WAS getting ear infections frequently and always scratching. This started about two years ago. I finally took her to a new vet. (my old vet NEVER mentioned food allergies. hmmmm). Vet said chronic ear infections are usually due to food allergies and that we could try their food at $100.00 a 20lb bag. YIKES! We found NL Lamaderm at Wal-mart. We noticed after just a few days that Sheila stopped scratching. Needless to say really. the change of food.(which. by the way. she gobbled up).caused really bad gas. But after a few weeks that stopped too. No ear infections. no scratching. We are thrilled with this product. We pay less than $25.00 for a 20lb bag at Wal-Mart. Thank you NLPP for providing us with the key to a healthier dog.
22322,B0029JG4DM,A2TO2BN3P4C00L,Music Fan Jeff,4/4,1255046400,so-so flavor. too much fiber for me,I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors. but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad. but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people. this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them). but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour. white rice. white bread. etc) rather than whole grain foods. then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me. however. the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits. vegetables. and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy). but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product. I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.
22325,B000LKWUAM,A1ZHBI0FDO3031,ennui Patrick,0/0,1306108800,Tastes Good. Drink it all and it makes you VERY nervous,I Love the Blue Sky Energy Drink. Wild Berry Flavor. but was used to drinking the 8 oz size that I would buy at the grocery store. so I was very surprised to receive a whopping 16 oz size via Amazon. Since I was used to drinking the 8 oz size with no problem. I gave it no thought to drink the 16 oz. BOY was that a mistake. Not only did it make me VERY nervous. but it was entirely too much 'energy' for my system at once. From then on I only drank half a can at a time and I was fine. They should put a warning on this stuff. DO NOT DRINK A WHOLE CAN.
22328,B0035MV1VC,A1FATHSMFRH2LS,amy amy,4/5,1286150400,Mmmm...great in oatmeal!,I eat steel cut oatmeal almost every morning and I was so happy to discover this sweetener.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and not too sweet.  I'd much rather use agave than something artificial or pre-sweetened.  I'm sure it would also be delicious on pancakes or maybe even ice cream!  YUM!
22335,B000LRKNH2,A3HBU7LC2MR8C8,Road Warrior,0/0,1318636800,Superior brand of Bulgur,This is bulgur seems to provide better flavor and texture. We use the Fine grade for both tabbouleh and kufta. The Coarse grade makes delicious bulgur pilaf.
22369,B001HTJ49G,A3T41GU2DV65RX,Jasmin M. Davis Jas,4/4,1259539200,Best Pretzels!,My husband and I were looking for a good snack and these fit the bill for us. More fiber than your normal pretzel. lots of flavor and has a decent amount of protein too. These are terrific! Its been part of our diet for over a year and we have lost about 60 pounds each. We make our own hummus and eat these with it. or I eat them with a wedge of laughing cow cheese or peanut butter.
22392,B001HTJ49G,A3699F5IARONN1,Candice H. Greene,0/0,1325894400,Spelt pretzels with mustard - YUMMY!,We buy the organic spelt pretzels by Newman's Own. This company sends them fast and so nicely - packed and separated in individual slots so they don't break or pop open. The pretzels themselves are yummy. Lately we've been dipping into different mustard flavors - a great snack! A good variety of non-salted ones mixed with some salty ones. a good balance. They taste better than your average pretzel on the market and they are healthier for you. I recommend the spelt pretzels!
22416,B001HTJ49G,A17KNP1347GV5D,Jinna,0/0,1249430400,Great Pretzels,I love the Newman's pretzels. both the wheat and the spelt versions.  Not too salty and very crisp.
22421,B001HTJ49G,AVSN0J4VQ5HLG,Susie Q Susie Q,0/0,1226793600,yummy pretzels!,I bought these for my husband for healthy snacking in the evening.and they are great! High in fiber and protein. but low in calories per serving.  Even my 5 year old (who does not eat anything!)will eat these pretzels.<br />They are crispy. and slightly nutty tasting. I will always have a case on hand.
22449,B002DHDJ74,A2Q5C8S3DTM3PW,paula,0/0,1308268800,This is the best gum!  I'm soo sad I can't find it in stores around here any more!,This is the best gum!  I'm soo sad I can't find it in stores around here any more!
22451,B001EO7E0K,A39SC9Q4QSVRG8,Christian Mrosko,1/1,1330819200,Not What I Expected,Not the sweet clam taste I was expecting. The product is sort of grayish and dirty looking. not fleshy pink as I expected. The average very small clam size is about 3/8 inch with many in pieces or crushed like mush. Occasional pieces of hard elements such as shell bits or something else that is hard. Somewhat of an off flavor. sort of fishy or sea weedy. A product of China which I was suspect of at the start as I think their quality control often suffers with many products and I was right. I would not recommend this product.
22454,B001EO7E0K,AQXJM6TILVEDY,SRRT,0/1,1303344000,Light scent and very pleasant,Another great Roland product!  I cannot say I've been let down by this brand.  Like the mussels. these. too. are packed in water and are already pre-cooked.  A little rinsing may be necessary. but there's no pungent or fishy odor; the water will run clear after light agitation in a strainer... or you can just pour into and dump out water from the can before using.  There's hardly any grit to be found in the clams themselves (as sometimes happens with the shelled critters like these. mussels. scallops. etc.).  Add them to whatever you want (I've stirred them in with a homemade marinara sauce and a few spices) or eat them separately.  My one concern was that they'd end up being rubbery. as clam bits tend to be. but these are very small. pretty much yanked whole out of the shell. and quite tender yet firm.  I'm thinking that perhaps they get rubbery if overcooked. but I haven't had that experience yet.  Highly recommended.
22458,B0013A0NKS,A1SQ4IGWJQDEYU,Two Cents twocents,4/5,1294531200,I love the Stevita brand!,I have found the Stevita brand to be the best with the least after taste because they use a natural process of amino acids to strip the Stevia leaves.  I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda. but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.<br /><br />I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners. such as the exotoxic aspartame- NutraSweet (the most poisonous). Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn't pass through the blood brain barrier). Splendia. Sucralose. etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes. what would you call a company who has developed anti-nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame. which is unbelievably being labeled as organic. Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product. especially food. that is made in China. although it is nearly impossible to do these days. particularily if you shop at Wal-mart (the great Wal of China).  By the way. aspartame is a terrific ant killer and Sweet n low is rat poison.  I am surprised that they aren't used in chemotherapy.  I reckon these chemicals aren't expensive enough to use in medicine.
22463,B0013A0NKS,A1BT3TD2FVRK0K,hello kitty,1/1,1231286400,good product,i got this on sale for a great price.  i really like this brand and company. stevita. because they grow their own stevia organically (even though it's not certified organic) in brazil. and not china!!!  (i'm afraid of even certified organic foods from china).  the only reason i give it 4 stars is because it has a bit more of an aftertaste than other brands. but the quality of this brand is much better.
22469,B0013A0NKS,A1OW05IFB843RN,audchild Donna,0/0,1309305600,Toffee taste is great...but...,The toffee taste is very good.  It's buttery and rich. like English Toffee.  But. the stevia is very bitter.  I don't understand why the sweetener is so bitter.  I will stick with my Xylitol and know that I am helping my oral health with it's use.
22495,B00016AU3K,A3D88252ANRJ9Z,Mark Greer,1/3,1291852800,Tested it's Effects: None,On an empty stomach. in a controlled environment. with plenty of water. I felt no physical change to stress levels. at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted). this product is bunk.<br /><br />But it tastes good. and maybe it could have a little placebo effect.
22498,B001GQJGMK,AG1JWQCP2UKI7,KGS,2/2,1293235200,Can't tell what you'll receive,This item is listed and is identified as BLACKBERRY tea. although the image is clearly a box of BLUEBERRY tea.<br /><br />When I pointed out this conflicting data. AMAZON advised that they didn't see a problem.<br />Now I don't know about you. but I want to KNOW if I would receive blackberry or blueberry tea.  They are not the same thing.<br /><br />Sometimes Amazon's stupidity simply amazes me.
22499,B001EPPD84,A385H0TC4YZ1KC,Michelle Hamilton,0/0,1304467200,GREAT favor....,I purchased this for a wedding cake I recently made. My client LOVED the flavor. It isn't too overpowering and has just the right scent.<br /><br />I will certainly be buying this everytime I need more. By the way...a little goes a long way!
22505,B00060OG8Q,A3UHH9Z4GDB2YQ,Gary Strothenke,0/0,1188345600,Great beverage,I work 12 hour days and lived on coffee and Gatorade .... Until I tried VitaminWater Essential.  It has replaced forever my other cold beverages.  Soda and other soft drinks were just too sicky-sweet to drink all day long. I found the Essential orange flavor just right. It has a long way to go to replace my coffee (hehehe). but I do recommend it to anyone.<br />PS: I've tried many of their other flavors - they don't do it for me. Essential is my favorite.
22510,B001E6EEE2,A3N5KI8UTFHNW7,D. MILLER Online Shopper,2/3,1294790400,Good. but way too pricey!!!!,I love Cocoa Krispies and it was nice to find them in bulk via online. When I bought this item. it was a very good price. I no longer order from here because price went up almost 3 times from when I first ordered. I don't recommend anyone buy at this price. Walmart has in stores for less than $3 a box same size.
22524,B004746V26,A2GGSC2W2LQHX,Kenneth Smith,0/0,1347667200,Great for passionfruit lovers,Nothing compares to fresh passionfruit but this concentrate is the next best thing.  I use it sparingly (mixed ~1 to 8 with sparkling water or tonic water) and don't need any sugar. though it is tart on its own.  I've tried a number of other passionfruit concentrates and this is the best I've found.
22538,B002BCE9JS,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,Gabriela Perez Oy! So many books. . . .,6/8,1249603200,pretty tasty. but I'd like more kick,I ordered this in spite of a negative experience I'd had with the Kung Pao Bowl. I'm glad I did. The texture of these noodles is much better. lighter and yet hearty enough to quench my appetite.<br /><br />When you open this up. you unpack the soft noodles. pour hot water over them. and let them soften a wee bit in that hot water. Then you drain the water. add new hot water and the contents of both seasoning/topping packets. then nuke the bowl for a couple of minutes.<br /><br />What you end up with is a nice bowl of soup. chockablock with noodles. sliced scallions and bok choy. and a light beefy flavor with just a hint of sweetness. I'd like it to be spicier. but that's just me. I'm big on spice and ginger and would have made this nose-clearingly intense if it were up to me! :-)<br /><br />Anyway. this one is a keeper. I will try other Annie Chun soups. since I now know I love her steamed rice and her pho soup.
22546,B002BCE9JS,A2PWU12LUD5ECB,Skullruler,0/0,1326844800,my fav from annie chun,tastes very nice!!! =D try it yourself - i must say the other annie chun stuff is pretty gross.. but this one is a gem.
22551,B002BCE9JS,AECLIG64JQJPM,The Daughter of a King,0/0,1301788800,Close!,Bein an avid Pho indulger I had to try Annie Chun's version. I'm in the middle of no where. no local Pho restaurants here.<br /><br />Being freeze dried and not fresh I have to say it came a little close to the smell and taste of authentic pho. It was however missing the thin strips of steak. all the veggies. and of course the fresh noodles. It definitely quenched my desire for Pho. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. It's a good substitute. but would never truly be the real deal. I say go for it!
22560,B002BCE9JS,A2MMFICDPQNIZ8,A. Garg dad FACE,0/1,1291939200,Best Soup Bowls that I've tried. but expensive,This product from Annie Chun is very good. For a soup-in-a-bowl package. it has well packaged ingredients including soft noodles.dehydrated veggies. and a flavor pack.  I found that it really became a whole meal when I added egg. shrimp. etc. It was delicious!  Only drawback is the price: its more than $2.00/ per bowl.  I have tried other soup bowls from Amazon which have been about 70% less: they were also nowhere near as good/ tasty as this product! If you can afford it. this is a great product.
22565,B000CQ25QE,A2NFTR4SRUNZK3,Jolene Como,2/2,1209254400,healthy and yummy,some might find it too chewy and nutty.  even fully cooked it tastes healthy. and some might not like that.  the sauce is perfect though. and i like being reminded that its good for me.

I take an 8oz block of cream cheese and spread about 3 tablespoons of the Thai Chili on top and serve with Triscuit crackers. It has been very popular at my home parties. Plus the cream cheese cuts down on the spicy heat.

22619,B00170NWEI,A32DCJHKUG1KAL,D. Huang,9/9,1295049600,very fresh and clean,Compared to a number of other brands I have tried. especially ones that aren't loose leaf. the taste of this green tea is simply great. Bright green color. fresh aroma. and a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />As the directions indicate. be careful not to steep the tea for too long and in overly hot water. When I leave the leaves in hot water for over 4 minutes. the color of the tea is no longer a clean green. but rather a yellowish green and it doesn't taste as good. Correctly prepared. it is one of the best green teas I have ever had.<br /><br />I usually bring water to just under a boil and steep the leaves for about 2 minutes. If the water does boil. I pour in some room temperature water and then mix in the boiling water. Using the same leaves. the first cup tastes awesome. the second tastes significantly weaker. and after that I don't really like the flavor anymore.<br />Also. use filtered water of some sort for the water if you can! It tastes much better than using tap water.
22633,B00170NWEI,AL09BT63XHN1L,teamaster,3/5,1263772800,yes!,This tea is vacuum packed for freshness (a foil bag inside the tin). as all sencha should be. The taste is pure. green. and luscious. [...] I would give this 5 stars. but when I bought this it was 12 dollars and now it's 14.

What I was familiar with was a wonderful product. with a delightful popping texture. a strong. salty bite. and a lovely presentation.<br /><br />What I got. to my vast embarrassment and disgust. was a fetid. sweet taste and a runny. slightly greenish goo the color and texture of goose plop.<br /><br />I actually thought the stuff had maybe gone bad. Then I noticed the ingredient list.<br /><br />Really? Lemon Juice? Xanthan Gum? What on earth are these ingredients doing in a jar of caviar?<br /><br />I know this stuff is not exactly high end. but come on! It was previously a very nice product!<br /><br />I was gonna toss it. but the hostess ended up giving it to her cat. Do not know if he ate it or not.<br /><br />Bitterly disappointed in this. Seriously. it's not edible. It's absolutely disgusting. both in looks and in taste.

Black Beans 'N Rice. 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

I have a cup in the afternoon. and if I'm tired on Friday night. I have a cup before I go out. For the last two years I've been fulfilling my strong tea cravings with Twining's Irish Breakfast Tea- it's strong and has a robust flavor. I never new what I was missing out on until I bought a box of Barry's Tea at World Market last week. Barry's has the most full. satisfying flavor that I've ever experienced in a tea. I can't describe just how wonderful this tea is. If you're a tea drinker. pick up some Barry's Tea ASAP- you won't be disappointed!

Mandrake (all same seller) & Belladona (different seller). I have never ordered from this company & was a little nervous ordering over ocean. however my order came very quickly. was very well packaged. and the bottles are of good study quality. Price is also good for the 4oz & I didn't have to pay shipping w/ my order.<br /><br />I have had long term sleep issues and got these to help & they do seem to be helping - these are used in combo w/ Passion  Flower & 5HTP. which is a combo that I have created for my specific needs. I do put them all in a glass and add just a smidge of water to help them go down.<br /><br />I will buy more from this company - I like the variety they offer & the practices advertised.
22751,B00158UTDY,A2CLQTXFWRJNU4,globehk,0/0,1257120000,Different Grits,The pieces of grits are much larger than average sized grits. but the flavor is better. as these are true yellow corn grits. and not bleached out hominy grits. I have since trying this brand purchased some regular sized non-bleached organic yellow corn grits and like them much better. Also. this brand is quite expensive. even considering that you get the reuseable baggy. when compared to the price of the finer ground organic grits I purchased elsewhere. which only cost $1.79/lb. as opposed to the price of these grits and getting less than a pound.

I looked for it in the international section of every local grocery store and some asian groceries with no luck when I found it on Amazon and ordered it.  It is lemony but more complex then lemon juice and has a wonderful color.  It is amazing on fish. eggs. salad. avacado. even popcorn instead of salt.  I'm going to try it on everything. and then I'm going to order some more.

I had received the cheese version in a large bag from a family member as a gift. but this bag is significantly smaller. I think they bought it at a store like Big Lots for less.

I first discovered them at my health club in New Hampshire. where they charge $2.50 for one stick. so buying them from Amazon made sense. cutting the cost by a buck.

22867,B0012AL3VM,AMR7T2WFHHZJD,T. Bates,4/4,1250899200,Not too thrilled,I had some quinoa pasta at a relative's house and loved it. I eat kamut-spelt bread because of allergies. So I thought this combo for pasta would be good. especially since most quinoa seems to come with corn. The pasta is twisted very tight. making it thick. so it takes much longer to boil. I tried it in an alfreda sauce dish and didn't like it. :^( I much prefer spelt noodles or even rice. which are lighter weight. These things are heavy. Maybe if they are used differently? I don't know what to do with them. since Amazon sells them in bulk.

We made most of the batch for a family breakfast on Father's Day.  Everyone raved how good the pancakes were!. where did we get the mix?. what's the name of it?. and so on.  The blueberries in the mix are small blueberries. but they really had a lot of flavor--they weren't little tiny blue flecks like in some mixes.  The flavor was fantastic all around. and everyone really enjoyed them!  I will definitely be getting everyone a few of these for Christmas!

22895,B004ZIER34,A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH,The Three Woods mommy2lile,0/0,1324512000,Good Enough to Make Me Order More!,Finally! A delicious coffee has been created that doesn't send my stomach for a ride on the acid roller coaster. I am able to enjoy several cups of this wonderfully aromatic coffee without any trouble - a first for me. It was such a hit with me that I ended up ordering the Mocha Java flavor. Not exactly the best Mocha Java ever. but definitely easy on the digestive tract. Add a bit of French Vanilla creamer and you are set! Price-wise. you are definitely paying for good quality coffee so it makes the slightly higher price tag worth it. My order of Whole Bean (2.5lbs) was just over $20.00. (Shipping is free with Prime). It will last you a good while - even if you are a heavy coffee drinker like I am. I wish I would have stayed with the smooth flavor french roast. but you live and learn. Please note - I drink my coffee straight black. I made the Puroast Low Acid Coffee with 1TBS of ground coffee per cup. Yep. I like it strong. My husband has severe acid reflux and was able to enjoy a cup of coffee without any trouble. He didn't try more than one regular cup (about 6ozs) for fear that he would have problems later. Generally coffee causes gas pain. burping. etc. with him so he avoids it.

22904,B004ZIER34,A2K89R0B20LYHB,Christine,0/0,1321574400,Tastes like mild everyday coffee,This coffee tastes pretty good. I find that coffee sometimes hurts my stomach. and this low acid version didn't give me that usual burning feeling after drinking it that I get from my usual brand. I think there is some flavor trade-off; it tastes a little weaker and lacks some character of some bigger name coffees. However I think if coffee bothers you though. this is a really good product.
22906,B004ZIER34,A31YSTICHFYN7O,CPR xfilebuffyfan,0/0,1321488000,Low Acid. Low Taste,I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's mother who had mentioned getting heart burn from coffee - even though she loves coffee.  I thought this might make a reasonable fix to the situation.  After trying though she seemed to be a little less worried with the heart burn and little more concerned with the taste.  She didn't have heartburn. but she also didn't drink very much either - due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch. but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad. I had hoped this was going to be a big winner.
22933,B004ZIER34,AOVI5Y45L6B0J,Timothy Walker,0/0,1318809600,Hollow,As someone who suffers from stomach problems exacerbated (if not caused) by drinking far too much coffee. I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately. during the two days in which Puroast replaced my usual brew. I noticed no significant changes to my physical or mental states nor any respite from my ailments.<br /><br />So it strikes out as a medicine. but how is it as a beverage? The answer is. at best. nothing special.<br /><br />While billed as a dark French roast. the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso. and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste. which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor. such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water. In fairness. my wife liked it more. but she regularly dilutes the coffee that I make... why pay for gourmet when you could just add water?
22949,B004ZIER34,AJJ2UM58CSGUB,soulatpeace,0/0,1317945600,Tates is strong,I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />I tried this coffee early in the morning. I got my water ready for one cup<br />and used very little coffee to just see how strong it was. To my surprise is<br />quiet strong and don't need to use a whole lot. The taste is a little different<br />than you regular french roast coffee.<br /><br />As far as the acid taste goes. I did not felt that it was too acid but no to sweet<br />either. If you have ever tried Papua New Ginea Coffee this is a bit more acid.<br /><br />All in all a good cup of coffee.
22964,B004ZIER34,A1C7Y31S5QXNTR,majormusiclover,0/0,1317254400,A good alternative.,Purost low acid coffee will surely be of importance to those that love their coffee.<br />but NEED to reduce their acid in-take. this product contains less then 1/2 the usual amount.<br /><br />But since I don't get heartburn. or have acid reflux or stomach irritation problems.<br />I thought I'd sample this coffee on it's merits of good taste.<br /><br />Puroast has a good strong French Roast flavor.<br />But I found the coffee to lack smoothness. and to contain an unplesant bitterness.<br /><br />My opinion comes from comparing the taste of this coffee to the one I drink every day.<br />That perhaps is unfair because we all generally prefer what we get used to.<br />But I defiantly find Folgers coffee more to my liking.<br /><br />HOWEVER: if the day ever came that I needed to have less acid or give up coffee.<br />The first thing I would do is switch to Puroast for my health.
22966,B004ZIER34,A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0,Elisa 20,0/0,1317168000,Strong but Easier to Drink,I never get low acid coffee but. getting older. it seems like a good idea. I like coffee; I was looking forward to trying this.<br /><br />The flavor was a little more roasted than I usually like. but I don't drink black coffee and it was good (not great. but good) a little weaker and with milk and sugar. I did feel it created less acid and was easier on the digestion. I think it would be worth the price if you like the flavor--some will. others may find it too bold.
22970,B004ZIER34,A27Q1X75QCWTID,Amanda Devon,0/0,1317081600,Good but lacks a punch,I had to give up real coffee a few years ago because I have had GERD for the past 10 years that definitely flared up whenever I drank a cup of coffee.  I had to stay away from Dark Roast. Gourmet and even Decaf because of the acidity level in regular coffee.  I missed coffee!  Missed the smell of it. missed the warmth of it and quite frankly nothing else really perked me up better than a cup of old fashioned Joe.  So. when I saw the chance to review Puroast's low acid coffee (French Roast) I was intriqued.  I opened the bag and immediately the yummy french roast aroma wafted up into my nose and filled the room!  Ok...so you had me at first sniff.  Let's see what it takes like before I get excited further.  As I was scooping it into the coffee filter I noticed that the grind is pretty fine.  Almost powdery like.  I found that interesting.  I also was wondering why THEIR coffee was low acid...what was the difference in the overall process?  So. I went to their website and found this:<br /><br />Brew coffee's acid content and bitterness is greatly dependent upon the roast degree. type of roaster. and brewing method. As shown in the table below Puroast® coffee chemistry is unique and different from all of its competitors because Puroast® has a patented slow roasting method known as conduction roasting; which uses renewable fuel and exposes the coffee beans to a lower temperature for a longer period of time. This process is significantly different from the convection roasting method used by other coffee companies that employs a natural gas heated process. This roasting process is also called flash roasting because the coffee beans are exposed to high temperatures for a short time period.<br /><br />These people have done their research!  Check out their website: [...] and see for yourselves.  I was glad to see the process did not include any funky chemicals (like in the decaf process of other coffee manufacturers).<br /><br />I decided to forego my antacid the morning I tried this coffee to see if my GERD would act up.  I even had the nerve to try the coffee black which I never dared before.  It was delicious and I had no symptoms of heartburn or reflux all day.  I tried it the next morning and again drank it black (without any antacid prevention) and I noticed a little bit of heartburn but thought maybe it was because I was trying too much too consistently for my delicate system.  So. I skipped a couple of days and tried again. this time with some skim milk added.  I was fine.  I think the low acid really is helpful but I don't know if people who have really severe heartburn or GERD can drink it daily but it is nice to know that I can keep it in the house and enjoy a cup of coffee with company now and then.
22987,B004ZIER34,A3GMVCTJTHYG1F,Mom22boys,0/0,1315785600,Not great,We are coffee lovers. and my husband is a heartburn sufferer hence my excitement to try the Puroast Low Acid Coffee.  It wasn't horrible. but wasn't as good as we would have wanted.  It just didn't have that good coffee taste that we love.  If you don't like strong tasting coffee. then this might be okay for you. but it isn't for us.
22999,B004ZIER34,A1P2XYD265YE21,Andrea Readaholic,2/2,1317340800,Good Coffee,This is good coffee.  It is really low acid.  I think anybody who has acid problems would be able to drink this coffee.  It is French roast.<br /><br />I think this coffee is a good idea. especially for those people who can't drink coffee because of the acid.  Now they can.  I highly recommend this coffee for people with acid problems.  Or even if you don't have acid problems.  It is coffee - anybody who drinks coffee should be able to drink this coffee and enjoy it.<br /><br />If you are a coffee drinker. I highly recommend this coffee.
23001,B004ZIER34,A2PU80LCKRMC9X,Deborah K. Dobbins ~Triple D~,2/2,1314576000,Will not buy again...,I didn't like this coffee. It did have a good smell when I first opened the pack. but that is about it. I like a medium to strong flavor in my coffees and this was just plain weak. I guess if you have stomach problems or just like a light coffee this would be great. but anyone who likes alot of flavor won't like this.
23002,B004ZIER34,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,Ty Arthur xFiruath,0/0,1315440000,An acquired taste perhaps?,For those who love coffee but have bad heartburn issues. low acid coffee like the Puroast dark French roast may be a decent choice.  Pretty much anyone else can easily skip it. however. as the taste and smell are both frankly supbar.<br /><br />Clearly other reviewers have enjoyed this coffee. so individual taste reactions may vary. but I'm baffled at why this is advertised as being less bitter than standard coffee. It has a very strong and unpleasant chemical taste that is significantly more bitter than nearly any other coffee I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />This may not be an issue for everyone. but it's worth noting that the Puroast low acid variety doesn't create that wonderful brewed coffee aroma at all. You have to put your nose directly next to the cup to smell it at all. and then the result is an off-putting chemical scent to match the flavor. Having my kitchen fill up with that distinctive scent to let everyone know the coffee is ready is a major part of the coffee drinking experience. and this brand doesn't offer that.<br /><br />It seems like Puroast may be an acquired taste. but after four cups and trying the coffee both black and with different creamer options. I certainly didn't acquire it and can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious heartburn problem.

I was tempted by the low acid offer. since I often have heart burn when I drink coffee.  I was extremely surprised with how GOOD this coffee tasted. Seriously. I had very low expectations. and I was blown away not only by the fact that I had less heart burn. but the taste was great!  It not only didn't taste like low acid coffee. it didn't taste pre-ground.  That said. I was reviewing the prices for the low acid coffee. and it is waaay expensive.  Not sure I'll be buying it - probably just stick to my big mug of sweet tea.  If you can't leave coffee alone and you have heart burn. however. go ahead and try it.  Recommended for taste and low acid. not for cost.
23016,B004ZIER34,ABABCND8BHUXC,T. Patrick Killough All about Patrick,0/0,1314921600,Soothing to stomach. Unappealing taste.,Yesterday's mail brought from amazon.com's VINE program a free 3-ounce sample of PUROAST LOW ACID COFFEE. Dark French Roast.<br /><br />My wife and I tried it before. during and after breakfast this morning (2 mugs apiece so far).<br /><br />-- (1) How I prepared the coffee drink.<br /><br />My wife and I had had a late dinner yesterday evening at the monthly meeting of Asheville-Blue Ridge Torch Club in a first class local Hotel. In my case my main course was a stew based around a fatty cut of short ribs of beef. When I woke this morning. I fet mild stomach discomfort. and first reached for a GAVISCON-brand  <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QR76>Gaviscon Extra Strength Chewable Antacid Tablets. Original Flavor. 100-Count Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> stomach soother. An hour our so later my wife and I began sampling the PUROAST Low Acid Coffee. I prepared the drink  in in our MR COFFEE-brand drip coffee maker. I decided to do it exactly as I normally do with FOLGER's or other brands. aiming at ten cups of coffee based on three scoops of the ground beans. Those three scoops used up about 3/5 of the contents of our free sample. I will try the rest tomorrow.<br /><br /> And here are the agreed opinions of us both:<br /><br />-- (2) PUROAST coffee felt very soothing in the stomach - immediately. Here was something better than any other coffee we had ever tried. Here. a couple of hours later. I am still grateful for a sense that PUROAST soothed my agitated innards. This is a quality to build the brand around. no doubt.<br /><br />-- (3) Neither wife nor I found the taste pleasant. It was far from vile. We didn't feel compelled to stop drinking. As I write. I am still sipping my second mug. I am no expert on evaluating coffees. but if I put my mind to it I could probably describe five different flavor sensations. My wife and I discussed our sensations.<br /><br />First. I asked her: Does this remind you of POSTUM <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DGQK1Y>1904 Vintage Ad Postum Coffee Substitute Caffeine Free - Original Print Ad</a>? -- a drink I don't like. She: POSTUM tastes better. To me the underlying flavor reminds of POSTUM. a very STRONG POSTUM.<br /><br />Second. it tasted bitter in the mouth. though felt soothing in the stomach.<br /><br />Third. something reminds of wood shaving being turned into charcoal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: My wife and I are both tempted to explore further the concept of low acid coffee and to order other varieties from the company's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We are keeping an open mind. In my case I hope to find another blend that reminds me a bit more of coffee and a bit less of POSTUM.<br /><br />-OOO-

Let me first say I received this product free as part of amazon.com's VINE Program to generate reviews. I have has heartburn/acid reflux since I was a teenager (yes nervous kid) and I am always looking for low acid products. This Puroast Low Acid coffee taste great. you cannot tell. the difference between this and any fine french roast and you won't get heartburn. So I can give this a high recommendation.

Some may like the bitter French Roast. but I do not. I found it to be unpalatable.  I sweetened the coffee and added cream to try to tone down the bitterness. but that did not work. I was left with an undrinkable cup of coffee.  Sorry. Puroast. I cannot recommend this product!

Very easy on the stomach compared to regular coffee yet still adds a nice caffeine kick.  May not seem hearty enough to some who only enjoy high test regular but a nice alternative for those who love coffee but can't handle the after effects.  And definitely an alternative to those of us who have tried decafe to ease the impact on the digestive system.  Great black!

I separated the packet into 2 half pots for 2 days.  He loved the taste of it. it was bold and flavorful and did what it claimed to do...not give him heartburn.  That is a win-win in our book.  We recommend this coffee if you are looking for a bold flavor and want to avoid the heartburn.

Especially. those who have ailments like acid reflux disease. or antacid. Fortunately. there are coffees that are really good and safe to taste. For Puroast. they have made some specialty coffees for all that is safe and secure to drink. like their low acid French Roast. The taste is absolutely very strong. and holds up well with more popular brands like Maxwell House and Chock Full O' Nuts. I really liked the the taste of it. and if you are looking for a safe and secure coffee to drink. give Puroast Low Acid Coffee a try.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

I enjoyed my first cup of french roast in a long time. I sat down with my bagel and my coffee and had an enjoyable morning. My stomach didn't get upset and I didn't need an anacid. Yippee. The cost is high though but what I save on anacids makes it more affordable. For those of us with a touchy stomache. this is a great product.

Libbey,0/0,1312502400,Deep. darkly roated coffee with excellent taste,My husband has a hiatus hernia and must be very careful about drinking coffee and eating other acidic foods.  I was delighted to find out about this product.  We have a Keurig coffee-maker and the replaceable/reusable inserts.  I brewed us each a cup of this coffee and thoroughly enjoyed both the aroma and taste.  We both drink our coffee black. no sugar. so we really can appreciate the full flavor of the beverage.  Puroast is French Roast. which is a very dark deep roasted coffee bean. without bitterness or a funky aftertaste.
23088,B004ZIER34,A3TB9HNQR54B5V,John John,0/0,1312243200,Great Tasting Coffee,Preferences for type of coffee varies from person to person. so I'm not surprised some people like this brand and some do not. I drink coffee every day and have tried many different types. I've never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect.  In my opinion. this was very good.  It has a rich. dark roasted starbuck-like taste.  I recommend trying it.
23112,B004ZIER34,A1YZEKPPMXG1YJ,Ilovebooks ilovebooks,0/0,1312070400,Too strong,I brewed a pot of this but found it too strong. Stronger than Starbucks even. Even with extra milk it still had that too strong taste. No acidic aftertaste. but I don't think many will enjoy its taste.

I would put this more in the dark-Italian roast range. On the back side of flavor without much roundness. there is a little less body than perfect. Certainly the lack of acid is a major plus. On just the coffee taste. I'd give it three STARS.

Popov Sinnister,1/1,1337212800,really good coffee and much easier on my stomach,I am someone who suffers from stomach ulcers and so when I saw this coffee I'd jump at the opportunity to buy it .  it was much easier on my stomach and finally I was able to enjoy coffee again highly recommended
23157,B004ZIER34,A3IMO49QD6OYKN,D. A. Ross,1/1,1317945600,Coffee that's low on acid. but also low on punch,For those who normally steep a few Rolaids or Tums in their mug of Joe. a low-acid coffee seems an ideal alternative to those upset tummies. Puroast Low Acid French Roast is one such alternative. but there is a definite trade-off. The coffee is certainly low on acid. leaving me feeling well after a cup or two. But. the Puroast lacks that robust bitterness that regular coffee has. making it less rewarding on the palate. It's not that the flavor is undesirable -- in fact. it tastes just fine; it just isn't as rich. due to the process of removing the acidity (?).<br /><br />Overall. Puroast will certainly due in a pinch. and is great for those who suffer major acid indigestion from consuming regular coffee. But if you can tolerate a little discomfort and don't mind taking Pepto. you may wish to stick with your grande latte from Starbucks.
23176,B004ZIER34,A1IGCX2XNZPUVF,Paul R. Waibel Paul R. Waibel,1/1,1312934400,Low Acid and Little Taste,In order to taste test this coffee. I used the sample to make a pot.  I used freshly filtered water and a Melitta drip cone with a Melitta filter.  I invited two other coffee lovers to join me in trying the brewed coffee.  Each of us agreed that this dark roast coffee was mild. did have the bitter taste that one associates with dark roast coffee. but was weak in flavor.  Whether or not that is a result of removing the acid. I can only leave to the chemists to decide.  For one who needs to avoid acid. I believe this is a good choice.  But. if you really love the flavor of good coffee. then you may want to consider other options.
23191,B004ZIER34,AXU3VKZE848IY,Chris Zee Shutterbug,1/1,1312070400,If all you want is low acid. try other beverages. With Data.,Puroast Low Acid Coffee<br />If all you want is low acid. try other beverages. With Data.<br />To start with I do experience occasional heartburn. reflux. etc. so this was a very exciting taste test. I brewed a pot of fairly well renowned regular coffee. and a pot of Puroast. I poured both into identical cups. no milk or sugar to start with. The regular coffee had a deep brown color. while the Puroast had a black brown color. I tested the pH of both. the regular was about 5-5.5 while the Puroast was indeed 7.0 or neutral as claimed. First taste was of the Puroast as I did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste. Good grief... It was wet. it was warm. very flat taste with no finish. hardly what I would call even an average cup of coffee. The best comparison is that to a day old coffee that has been left to evaporate and oxidize. Perhaps burned charcoal aroma with hints of bitter chocolate and caramel? The standard coffee by comparison had a rich coffee aroma. and the taste was wonderfully balanced coffee bean with tinge of vanilla. and a pleasant finish with a slight kick (the balance finish kick is unfortunately from the acid).<br /><br />I now added some whole milk. and as expected the regular coffee mellowed out a bit. but all of the wonderful flavor still came across. Incredibly when I added milk to the Puroast. it turned a poor tasting cup into an awful tasting cup. The flavor now became that of  mostly spoiled milk! This was such a strange sensation that I had three more people confirm the sour milk phenomenon. To top things of. the color had now become that of black brown mud.<br /><br />So all in all. this was a bad experience. If you have a need to drink a low acid coffee do this. Get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead.
23202,B004ZIER34,A1ZVMTIRYZQDL4,Marie Antoinette,2/3,1318204800,BURNED FLAVOR,Although I think it's good that they came out with low acid coffee for some people that have issues with too much acid in their diet. I really didn't care for this particular coffee.  I drink my coffee black and I'm used to tasting the pure flavor of coffee and I felt that this coffee had a strong burned flavor. Not my cup of tea. or should I say coffee.
23207,B004ZIER34,A16TEPQHKD8W3O,"Janice King Author, &34;Copywriting That Se...",0/0,1348185600,Just okay,More like a slightly darker-roast version of standard office coffee. Thin body; not a true French roast flavor. It did seem to be less acidic.

23401,B004R8J8E0,ACWVXZ8VKJ19V,Karen S. Garvin,0/0,1313452800,Easy dinner option,Shake 'n Bake has been around a long time. which should tell you something about the product. It's very easy to use -- just put it in a plastic bag. add your pork chop (or whatever). and shake until the meat is coated with the crumbs. They tell you to put the crumbs in a bowl if you don't happen to have a plastic bag. so you're not limited there.<br /><br />I used the coating for pork chops and they didn't stick to the pan. The underside crumbs were a bit mushy and not crunchy. so I don't know if I should have flipped the pork chops halfway through cooking or what. I guess I'll have to get more Shake 'n Bake and try it again. My husband said it was okay. which isn't a bad thing. It's not something to rave about<br /><br />The ingredients are enriched wheat flour. various B vitamins. salt. canola oil. sugar. spice. caramel color. dried onions. dextrose. yeast. extracts of paprika. and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). There are six 40-calorie servings per pouch. My only qualm is with the spice. since I'm trying to avoid MSG and I don't know if it can be hidden under spice. If it's in there. it's a very small amount. but I prefer full disclosure on ingredient labels. The onions are also very. very small. I actually don't like onions. but I do like onion powder. If you have kids who are picky eaters. they won't notice the onions. I didn't. ;)<br /><br />The original pork flavor is mild and makes a nice meal by itself. but if you want to spice it up. you can always mix in your own herbs and spices. That makes it very versatile. Overall. a good item to have in your pantry.
23410,B004R8J8E0,ABMX8XUNPR3LP,Jennifer Sicurella,0/0,1312243200,Crunchy. Moist and a Little Bland,Pork has a tendency to dry out during cooking. and Shake N Bake does a very good job keeping all the juices sealed into the meat. Toss your chops in a plastic bag with a packet of Shake N Bake until coated. pop them in the oven and 15 minutes later. you have juicy pork chops with a satisfying crunch you can usually only get from frying.<br /><br />Shake N Bake would be the perfect pork enhancing product if it has a little more taste to it. The ingredients name dried onions. extractives (?) of paprika. and the very descriptive term - spice. I don't know could possibly be included in this secret spice because a Shake N Bake pork chop tastes very close to a regular pork chop with a plain breadcrumb coating.<br /><br />Shake N Bake is quick. easy to use and results in a decent. albeit bland. piece of pork. Good for kids and picky eaters. For those looking juicy pork chops with more zest.

23429,B004R8J8E0,A2QANOGP5LLPBQ,Toodles!,4/4,1312329600,Light flavor. light breading. nice taste,I don't fix much pork (I don't know why?!). but I picked up some (4) thin cut pork tenderloins to use with this product.  I had plenty of Shake'N Bake crumbs left over to do more chops/tenderloins.  I liked how the crumbs gave the pork a light taste and certainly did NOT overpower the meat itself.  I don't like tons of flavorings to overpower what I'm eating. so if that is what you typically want/need (like tons of salt. garlic. etc.). I'm not sure if this will do it for you.  You could probably add some garlic or spices to the crumb mix if you needed to.  I'm currently on a low-carb diet. so I was not going to put my pork in the mix. but. looking at the label. it really wasn't too bad - so I had some myself!  And. even if you don't want to eat the breading. but you do want the flavor. it was easy to scrape off of the port after cooking.  I liked it. my kids liked it. I would give it a try again!
23446,B004R8J8E0,A30LAVLDNH4JR0,Mrs. Krinklebine piddly,2/3,1314835200,Makes Pork tender and delectable...,I usually just pan fry my pork and it always comes out a little dry and flavor lacking.

23456,B004R8J8E0,A105S56ODHGJEK,Peace Daddy Eclectic ReflectionZ,0/0,1321315200,A dinner classic.,Shake N Bake is a longtime favorite in our household. This pork version does what it's supposed to do: It gives your pork a tasty. slightly crispy and flavorful coating that doesn't completely overpower the flavor of the pork itself. Don't let the pork label fool you into believing it's one-dimensional. however. because this could just as easily be used on chicken as well. In the end. it is more expensive than bread crumbs. but in my opinion the flavor and convenience are worth it. Can't go wrong with a dinner classic like this.
23457,B004R8J8E0,A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,0/0,1321056000,No plastic bag for shaking. less Shake N Bake than the standard box - flavor is the same,Shake N Bake in the original pork flavor has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a little girl. When I was a kid. it was often what I would request for my birthday dinner and I still crave Shake N Bake pork chops every now and then.<br /><br />When I selected the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch. I really wasn't sure what it was. I thought maybe it was a pouch that you put the pork chop in and cooked it in the pouch. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />The pouch is just a packet of the Shake N Bake mix. That's it. There is no little plastic bag to shake the chops in. so you have to provide your own bag. Not only that. but the pouch is only 2.25-ounces. as opposed to the 3-ounce packets you get in the standard Shake N Bake box. so it coats fewer pork chops. To be fair. it does state on the back of the pouch that this packet makes 4-6 pork chops instead of the 6-8 chops the 3-ounce packet makes.<br /><br />For me. this just isn't something I am very interested in. with one exception. I confess I am one of those people who like extra Shake N Bake on my pork chops. I often use 1 ½ - 2 packets for 6-8 pork chops. The Shake N Bake pouch would be handy to use along with one of the 3-ounce packets to accommodate my desire for extra Shake N Bake.<br /><br />As for the flavor. it is the same Shake N Bake Original Pork flavor I know and love. There are no changes to the flavor. just the packaging.<br /><br />I haven't found these in any of my local grocery stores yet. but they can be ordered through Amazon. I honestly don't know that I would buy these. I just don't see a need for these pouches and will stick to the normal box of <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVVQ>Shake 'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix.

23474,B004R8J8E0,A2I98OOPNIJNYY,Altar Boy Pax Vobis,0/0,1318723200,Very good breading with interesting flavors,I normally buy House Autry or similar specialized breading when frying or oven baking up some fish. pork or beef.  So I was a little skeptical to try an old brand breading Shake n Bake.  I grew up on shake and bake.  In the early days it had a cheap garlic paprika flavor that lingered in your mouth after a meal.  However. they must have improved the product because this Shake N Bake Pork was great.  It was not cheap or stale tasting.  Working it in with a little flower produced a very mild and pleasant experience.  I highly recommend considering this product when breading some thick pork chops.
23483,B004R8J8E0,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,VIDFAN specfellow,0/0,1317772800,Sometimes The Old Standby Is the Best,Usually I buy spicy Shake N' Bake seasonings. so I was prepared to be a little disappointed when I tried my sample of the Original Pork breading. It turned out to be pretty tasty - the crispy breading added a subtle flavor to the pork and didn't overpower it. Add some rice or pasta and a side of vegetables and you've got yourself a healthy. home-cooked meal with little hassle. I'll make a note to buy more of the original flavor in the future.

The new size provides plenty of mix to coat several pork chops.<br /><br />The taste? The same great crunch you expect. The product is always fresh and never stale because of the small pouch.

I know it helped me sail through that move. even though I'm no longer young.<br /><br />I buy my Tulsi Tea through Amazon because the price is better than at Organic India website. or the health food store.I buy Chai Masala by the case (6 boxes). and this further decreases the price.<br />I strongly recommend this tea nto anyone who'd like a very calming. centering. yet invigorating tea.
23550,B000HDOOL6,A3FQFGI8PRDFSV,Jody Biggs,0/0,1288742400,My favorite chai latte powder,Note that this is a powder mix. not a liquid. as some other reviews currently seem to be implying...  Personally. I strongly prefer the powder mixes to the liquid mixes. since you just have to mix with hot water for the powders. as opposed to mixing with milk and heating for the liquids.  Among the powders. this is my favorite. but as it's all about taste. and taste can vary. that may not mean much to anyone else...  Add a little vanilla creamer. and this just can't be beat!

The company recently discontinued the spicy mix (orange box). but they would like to hear your comments; possibly if there was enough interest they would reintroduce it. I usually add extra cinnamon and cloves to the original variety.

I had no problems with growing the wheatgrass and it turned out to be delicious. I started using this product after being diagnosed with breast cancer and I am trying to stay healthy and enhance my immune system. I can not say for sure if it works but it makes me feel invigorated and I enjoy the routine. I like watching the wheatgrass grow and then consuming fresh juice.

23605,B001EO7GYY,A1EFT3KSH15P0B,Mike Lawton,2/3,1171324800,So/so effort from the Newman's Own brand...,I can't think of a product that Newman's Own makes that I don't like.  This is probably the closest.  Perhaps a more refined palate of a coffee connoisseur would disagree. but I find this coffee to be disappointing.  To be sure. it is extra bold. but I also think it tastes extremely earthy.<br /><br />I can't recommend it. but if you like bold. strong blends. it might be more to your liking.

23632,B000E1FXLG,A284P8XSG9HREA,M. Ram,1/1,1289174400,Good stuff. but the standard version is much better!,I've tried both versions of Pistachio Jell-O (with and without sugar). I understand eating the sugar-free version for health reasons. but it's sadly lacking. and not just because of the lack of sweetness.<br /><br />The regular version:<br />-Is thicker (more like a custard)<br />-Has a stronger pistachio flavor<br />-Has more actual pistachio bits (the sugar-free version has maybe 1/4 as many)<br /><br />Either way. pudding is a great comfort food if you're looking for a tasty snack.

23707,B0013NUGDE,A2LJJ4482V9LAW,SunnyBeachLife,1/1,1275696000,Best flavor. hands down of Popchips is barbeque!!,I bought a multi-box of flavors but this was the absolute best flavor (IMHO) in there so it's the one I'll comment on.  Spicy. sweet. flavorful. fun. crispy. lower fat than chips. I loved it.  I'll be buying more but only of this flavor.  The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.
23716,B0013NUGDE,A1V7ZYRVRGT9F5,C. Gallamore Weight Watcher Winner,1/1,1271376000,Awesome,These Pop Chips are incredible. They taste so much better than baked chips and the quantity you get for 2 points is so much more. I buy the variety case and love them all!
23723,B0013NUGDE,A1PZO2HQFTLHC7,Mary L. Runnion,1/1,1269043200,Pop Chips Original Chips,These are the best chips I have eaten. They are popped instead of fried or baked which makes them easier on the weight column.<br /><br />Love them. love them.
23724,B0013NUGDE,A2WNWQQX8Q3JEG,Sanjay Srivastava,1/1,1269043200,Too salty...,I love the taste of pop-chips but. I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked.tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.
23731,B0013NUGDE,A368F99UPGPP4R,L. Eckford,1/1,1264550400,Not my favorite,I love Popchips. However. I did not like this flavor at all. The garlic flavor was too intense.
23738,B0013NUGDE,A10PY7J8JMTP7Q,eBookworm,1/1,1249603200,Un-sinfully Lip Smackin' Good,Love these pop-chips.  I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips. but am I glad I did!  The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it. so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.
23749,B0013NUGDE,AXXWXM6K66YMZ,immelbatoast,1/1,1224288000,Great and Healthy,I love Salt & Vinegar chips and once I went on my diet I felt like I had to give them up because it's so hard to find healthy ones.  Then I finally found these and I love them!  They're strong tasting and I actually like them better than regular salt & vinegar chips.  They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack. but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!
23770,B0013NUGDE,A2V99EKUVSQHZR,JAS,0/0,1346284800,YUM!!,I cannot stop eating these wonderful chips!  Even my children like them.  I am currently a WW member and each bag is only 3 points so I get to eat the whole bag without any guilt.  Love. love. love them!
23820,B0013NUGDE,A3IUW081KXD3PE,pixels and bits,0/0,1330905600,Love the original - not so much the jalapeno or the sweet potato.,We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right. like you've never done it.)
23847,B0013NUGDE,A3KZCNV1N8R9GC,diljs,0/0,1328659200,POP it's a chip!,I'ma fairly healthy eater. but I LOVE chips.  Potato chips. tortilla chips. I like them all.  Popchips offer a chip like substance.with the promise of low fat.<br /><br />They crunch like chips but don't quite have a chip like texture; it's closer to a rice cake.  The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil. although less than normal chips.  There's more salt and sugar than I would like.<br /><br />In the end I found myself munching through the case of 24 fairly quickly.  Popchips taste good and aren't as bad for you.  Check them out!
23855,B0013NUGDE,A3RXGD0GGXS7U4,Rodney Myers,0/0,1328313600,These chips are meh,I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich. or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good. but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.
23874,B0013NUGDE,A3HB5SW2FNSTHS,Diamond,0/0,1327622400,Best snack chip ever!,Popchips are so flavorful and light. They are not greasy like Lays or any other regular potato chip. and it is softer than a pretzel. Popchips are so good. light. and crunchy yet fluffy. Pick your favorite flavor and try popchips. you will not regret it!
23895,B0013NUGDE,ADP90UE5RC3H4,deadwoodgal,0/0,1318377600,Great Chips!,I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite. but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all. these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips.
23898,B0013NUGDE,A1LTNRGWZFY4C9,GROUCHHUNTER,3/3,1253318400,Cheddar POPCHIPS are totally Yummy!,I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.
23916,B0013NUGDE,A3MJ7AYX57YD6G,2sexy2b50,0/0,1315267200,PopChips,This is a great product for those attempting to loose weight.  I currently participating in Weight Watches. they have a product that is similar but with less taste.  I prefer the popchips because of the flavor and it counts for the same amount of points in Weight Watchers.<br /><br />Thank you.
23930,B0013NUGDE,A2YTE8OTJRPWTM,Dog Lover,0/0,1309478400,Yummy low cal chip,I ordered a box of 24 of the variety pack of these after trying a couple of different flavors from my cafeteria at work.  This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip. but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack. I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well. but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain. the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky. the salt and pepper is OK. but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line. great chip. great alternative to other chip options.  Low calorie. low fat. and the subscription option is really convenient since I can't seem to find the individual bag option at any store in my area.
23932,B0013NUGDE,A3NJ7NZL6M3AR,MamaT,0/0,1308355200,Great for Dieters,Great for Dieters. Better taste than baked chips. I like these with the regular pop chips for good flavor. Just right on saltiness. Target carries them also but not all flavors.
23941,B0013NUGDE,A3BBC8E7QT7N9I,P. Harding,0/0,1304380800,the garlic parmesan pop chips,If you really love lots of garlic. you will love these. I like garlic but these have too much.....the garlic overrides the taste of parmesan so they might just as well call these garlic chips. You will have the garlic taste in your mouth for a looooong time.<br />In spite of that. I do love the pop chips especially the barbeque(which is strong but good) and the cheddar. I also like the plain but only when I have already eaten something spicy. The other varieties aren't bad either. I like these chips because they also help my cravings and I can eat them and have been able to lose weight which I really have needed to do. Although more expensive than traditional chips. I look at it as a trade off for a more healthy lifestyle.<br /> I only gave a 4 because of the overly garlic parmesan garlic pop chips. Otherwise I would have given a 5.
23950,B0013NUGDE,A1P80DQ1QCO68Q,Hide,0/0,1302307200,100 calories,These chips are so flavorful. They taste close to potato chips but they are 100 calories and about 3g fat. Much healthier. They have a great crunch and are nice and salty for when that's what you're looking for. My favorite is the BBQ a few of the others taste a little weird to me.
23960,B0013NUGDE,A3IR8KHXQNV81,Veronica Williams Shy Gal,0/0,1299888000,I see why they're called POPchips!,First and foremost. shame on me. I thought these were going to taste like dry. boring. bland chip replacements. Imagine my surprise halfway through the first bite. It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor. but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water. they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know. love. and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack. a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag. you might not want to share.
23968,B0013NUGDE,A16LMUR3AX8T2J,bag,0/0,1297900800,Yum,These are better than the Special K things. These actually taste like potato (because they are potato). I describe them as a mix between Munchos and O'Boises. Delicious.
23986,B0013NUGDE,A3KT5JU7RD4Q4O,Jin,0/0,1291766400,Great chip. little salty for me.,I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips. it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.
23992,B0013NUGDE,A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,K. Stuckey kateling,0/0,1290384000,tasty treat,I got to sample some of these at a food show and they were pretty good. The original flavor and texture kind of reminded me of Munchos. The barbecue is good too. very sweet. like KC Masterpiece. And the sour cream and chives is pretty good as well. If I was looking for a quick salty fix. I would definitely go with the original. They are very light and airy. different!
23993,B0013NUGDE,A1RQTFGFW3HWM1,tayloredone,0/0,1290297600,BEWARE: ADDICTIVE :-),These healthy chips are beyond delicious. Only wish they made them in larger bags but then again. I would be eating twice as much and cheaper to buy by the case on Amazon then in the store.

24045,B0013NUGDE,A2VSDBNRYGVWK,Happy Clicker,0/0,1277078400,Best Chips ever,I love these chips.  They are crunchy and they don't crumble in to little pieces in the bag. I truely believe that Barbeque Popchips taste better than any other Barbeque chips on the market.
24048,B0013NUGDE,A2HKGQ3OBD6Q23,D. Yang,0/0,1268006400,Much better than I thought,I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises. but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it. tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way. these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it. just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!
24055,B0013NUGDE,ACM6X1Q9R2K81,MedTech2009,0/0,1265414400,Amazing snack,Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.  Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.  One of these bags is a lot more filling than a small bag of chips and taste even better.  I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.

They don't sell them at our regular grocery store. so we bought them on-line through Amazon.  The pop chips came on-time. packaged well. and it's cheaper to buy them in bulk like this!
24111,B0013NUGDE,A3M798YYM8TSQG,Judy,0/0,1236988800,Similar to Munchos,Discovering I have a yeast allergy meant I had to quit eating Munchos--a childhood favorite. Hurray!! These are very similar and just as good. :)
24115,B0013NUGDE,AJ6GK0GEB3OA,Nick,0/0,1227398400,great chips,My parents were visiting us in Las Vegas from the east coast. I was at my favorite grocery store and as we passed the chips I said you have to try these chips. (my wife and I have been hooked for some time now) my mother said that she doesn't buy chips since they are too greasy. I said I promise you will love these. When we got home I opened the bag and handed it to them. They loved them. When they returned home I got a call from my parents telling me they went to every healthy store around and no one sells them. I sent a case to their home since you can not get them on the east coast and they are almost finished with them. Time to order another case. BEST CHIPS EVER. We keep many bags in the house.
24120,B0013NUGDE,A1PAGHECG401K1,Chel Micheline Chel Micheline,2/2,1222992000,ADDICTIVE,After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs. as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light. crispy. and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing. however. my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes. this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However. if you LOVE Vinegar. like I do. these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag). so if you overindulge. you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However. you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked. and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same. and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried. including the ones that are terribly bad for you.
24138,B0013NUGDE,A3VUSZI5KTFDYR,N. Hudson,1/2,1238976000,Awesome Chips,I love these chips they are the best chips at a low price to pay because they are baked.Only 3 points for weight watchers member's for 1ounce which is about 20 chips and there are 3ounces in this bag.

My whole family agreed and we threw them out. They tasted old and rancid. I wrote this to Amazon and never heard a word back about it. I just cancelled my regular delivery.
24147,B0013NUGDE,A3MFF3HWX2TB60,JJ,0/1,1329350400,Yummy goodies!  But are they any healthier?,Yum! Yum!  I liked these and they are certainly yummy chips.  They are a tad sweet and a tad salty mixed.  I guess they are more sweet than salty. though. Why only four stars?  These are like Pringles or Munchos in that they take mashed potato product (in this case. sweet potato). and form them into shapes and bake (excuse me. pop) them.  I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked. Most of the good nutritional value of the Sweet Potato has been lost. I would imagine.  Still. a tastey treat that is certainly not terribly bad for you!  :)

But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil. it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!

About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos. but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet. these will probably due.

Crispy!,These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful. but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say. except: Yum! Yum! And. oh. yes. with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag. my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis.

24221,B0013NUGDE,A1GYEGLX3P2Y7P,Shala Kerrigan,1/1,1327881600,Great crispy crunch and flavor,My family is addicted to crispy. salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24>Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat. and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label. but they are low calorie. low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family. even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland. but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour. not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber. vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.
24228,B0013NUGDE,A2QSBOAAGW1I1H,Julie A. Dawson Bards and Sages Publishing,1/1,1327449600,A healthier snack,We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake healthier for healthy.  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein. 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still. if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet. this is a good choice.  As an FYI. despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe. sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient. followed by sweet potato flakes. tapioca starch. a blend of various oils. corn flour. seasonings. etc. Not a huge deal. but its one of those truth in advertising points that annoys me so I mention it.
24246,B0013NUGDE,A2YRCV0DV6KR4T,mjp3md,1/1,1310256000,Love some. hate some,The cheddar flavor is THE BEST. Sour cream and onion is not far behind.

Starbucks isn't really for coffee lovers.  Starbucks is more for people who work in an office and need a cup which says Starbucks on it.<br /><br />I combine this syrup with my favorite coffee of all time. <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004868RJ8>Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood Ground Coffee. 17.6-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a>  I warmed up a mug of Douwe Egberts and Torani Syrup in the microwave at work - what a mistake.  My co-workers reacted like they've never smelled hazelnut coffee before.  They gathered around me like zombies looking for coffee to feed on.  It was horrifying to see the aroma of hot coffee turn the office staff into monsters.  Someone shouted and organized a coffee run to the local doughnut shop to distract them while I escaped with my Torani hazelnut coffee.<br /><br />Now I keep my coffee warm in an insulated mug from home so I don't have to run the gauntlet to and from the cafeteria at work. <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043X3X7C>Zojirushi DB50-BA Stainless Mug Black 17 oz/0.5 liter</a><br /><br />Always make sure that you keep some of this on-hand to fend off the coffee zombies!<br /><br />I put a splash into my insulated mug with some fat-free half 'n half and I'm set for the morning.

I have a BIG Black Lab who can chew up a store bought 2 foot rawhide in less than an hour. That being said this one has lasted a week now. I am so pleased with this product that this is our 8th purchase of the different styles offered. Our furry baby just loves them. A PLUS to this product. it is not only good for his hips and joints. but he digests this one easily. Unlike the cheap store bought ones he has choked up and has gotten sick from. We have no complaints about this rawhide at all. Just wish they came even bigger. Best rawhide we have ever bought and we will not go back to the store bought ones now.

I'm trying to cut down on the sugar in foods.  I use agave nectar as my sweetner for alot of things so was really surprised to see this ketchup.  It tastes great and I'm kind of a ketchup snob.  In our family we used to get teased like a little hamburger with your ketchup so you know I had to find one that tasted as good as the popular brand I was using.  Thanks for the product.

I got them and tried them right away.  Totally fell in love with them.  Not only are they organic. but there are only 2 ingredients - organic apples. organic cinnamon!  No preservatives!

I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting. although. I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried. they are crunchy. like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage. you can eat more than you mean to. but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars. twenty nine cents.
24396,B0017I753O,A2ZQE4X9GYJMRI,Meno,0/0,1324252800,Great snack. great dessert,These chips are really good. They're delicious and a healthy alternative as a snack or dessert. They're very crunchy.

24439,B004R8J8EK,A312UBIOP091MH,Teacher Jeanne,0/0,1349827200,Who doesn't like Shake 'N Bake!,Shake 'N Bake has been a part of my life for years.  I can remember doing chicken breasts and pork chops with my mom many years back.  It is fun and easy. and makes plain old meat more fun.  Now my son is my shaker and he now loves it like I did.  That being said. let me tell you that it will never look like it does on the front of the package.  The coating is never as thick as in the picture.  What you get is a nice thin coating.<br /><br />This particular style of Shake 'N Bake comes in a pouch so it is missing the plastic bag that you get when you buy it the old fashioned way.  It is not difficult using a Glad or Ziplock brand bag to do your shaking.  This is a nice way to change up your usual grilled or sauteed chicken.  Give it a little shake. bake it in the oven. and enjoy!
24451,B004R8J8EK,AD3R2M2DT2BY3,Alexandra Cenni Poisoned Rationality,0/0,1312848000,Quick and Easy,Admittedly I normally would only use breading or flour for my chicken. but that gets messy (what with the eggs and frying and such) and during the summer I had a handful more mouths to feed with my siblings inviting their friends over to eat every other night.  So for me Shake 'n' Bake. which I haven't had since I was at least 10 years old. was the perfect solution.<br /><br />I do however caution that while this worked perfectly well with the full sized chicken breasts. everyone seemed to prefer it more when the chicken was pounded thin.  The chicken came out juicier and less dry and the coating wasn't overwhelmingly salty.<br /><br />As a test group I had three 20somethings (not including myself) and two teens. and made the Shake 'n' Bake with both regular sized breasts and thin cutlets.  Excluding the time it took for me to butterfly the chicken breasts. it took maybe ten minutes total to coat the chicken to our liking and pop it in the oven.  The packaging says to cook the chicken for at least 15 minutes at 425. but I found that cooking it for 20 minutes. and letting it rest for an additional 5 minutes. worked out perfectly.<br /><br />The only complaint received was the saltiness. I didn't season the chicken beforehand (for obvious reasons) and pretty much everyone had assumed I did because the coating was salty.  Point of interest. my sister made a Honey Dijon mustard sauce to dip the chicken into and the coating worked perfectly with that. balancing out some of the sweetness of the honey Dijon.
24456,B004R8J8EK,A23RZIU0N8K2KR,M. Caceres,1/2,1311724800,Easy to make (pretty much fool-proof) lol,This is the first time I have ever received anything related towards food via Amazon. and it came in a box. with the pack of 12 inside a plastic bag all together. It has been 104 degrees in New York City recently. so the box was at room temperature but the pack of 12 inside the plastic bag was very warm to the touch.<br /><br />I put it in the fridge just to be sure until I google to see that you can leave it outside. thus I'm an idiot but that is another story =)<br /><br />Its pretty easy to make. just place the chicken inside a large ziplock bag. puts the crumbs of package inside. and shakes like no tomorrow. then places it in a pan. and put it in the oven.<br /><br />Very convenient for those of us who have no time on our hands. are extremely busy or lazy. or when we want to give our wives a break from cooking on sundays :)

One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining. but when I asked around I heard various reasons why (I was told hard water- switched to deer park with no results) and after eating ziwipeak my dog's tear stains are GONE.  It's unreal.  Most importantly... they LOVE it!  Even when I walk past the bag. they go nuts.  Worth EVERY PENNY.

We were up in arms when we got the email from the company that they would not have duck and yam treats anymore.  Charlie has a lot of allergies and duck and sweet potato is one of the few things that the vet said that he could have as a treat (along with his allergy dog food. lamb. rice. and hamburger) We lucked upon these duck and sweet potatoes in an Internet search. I hope they are as good as all the reviews say. Because Charlie will be very disappointed if his duckies were not coming after he did his business outside. that is his reward. Charlie is waiting in for his new duckies to come. and try them out. We have tried chicken and yam but he does not like them as much as his duckies.. We will keep you up to date on the progress on the new duckies they should be here in a day or two. Cross your fingers that they pass the muster.<br /><br />Just an update; after two weeks of switching duck and yam treats from a different company. Charlie has become a mad man for these duck and sweet potatoes. The other company is discontinuing their duck and yam. so on a whim and all these great reviews we tried this brand. now if you our down one of the old and one of these on the floor he gobbles down this one and just leaves the old kind. What a great find!  Charlie loves his duckie which he gets after doing his business outside. He now comes in and sits infront of his treat jar and waits. He eats the duck part first then the sweet potato which shocks me. I can believe he eats a veggie. But he loves them. I can not give a higher review then I am now. if there were a way to give 10 stars these would get 11! Great for dogs with allergies too. no filler just all natural products which makes me feel good about giving them to Charlie!  So worth the price. you only give your doggie 1-3 a day and there are a lot in a pack and it is resealable which keeps them fresh.  And they have the rawhide-ish duck which is good for their teeth and the sweet potato for fiber. I am kind of lucky that the old brand has stopped making theirs because I found these. and no need to run to Petsmart once a week to buy a new bag these seem to last forever. and are a good size for a treat. bigger than a milk bone and smaller than a greenie. Greenies used to be Charlie's favorite now he turns his nose up at them and wants his ducky  I can't say enough good things about them!<br /><br />I am buying three more bags today just so I have a stock up of them because I never want to run out!
24738,B003QNJZWC,A3GQ9ATZ99DBSJ,D. Staudt,0/0,1341532800,Wakes me up!,I buy this on Amazon every once in awhile to stock up. Great price. And it works for me!

24744,B0036VFWO4,A3PKVPKGQ100L6,L. Miller,0/0,1325808000,A LITTLE SKIMPY ON CONTENT.  OTHERWISE. LOVE IT!!!,I'm ALWAYS looking for great deals on low or no sodium organic food. This is very good if you like very basic. healthy. no frills. organic food. Only real complaint is that it's a little skimpy and you definately need to make a salad on the side to get filled up.  Also. when you buy in bulk like this you save close to a dollar a can compared to what my local supermarket charges for these.  It's not worth the price that way.  It's just barely worth it to me at the usual price (in bulk) that Amazon sells it for. Health Valley should lower the price just a bit or add more noodles and vegetables in the can.  I'm pleased enough overall. though.  and am going to continue to buy for now.  Peace and all good things. L.
24755,B000QUZ9DC,A28AXHZUEVAQ14,Stephen Barringer wishinIwasfishin,0/0,1233792000,yummy gum,wow the kids love this gum! i normally fill their machine with (much) cheaper gum balls but i decided to try chicle gum.  And we all love it.  it will be hard to go back to the other stuff.
24770,B001P248HS,A3A05FQYUOAM0B,mompeaches,0/0,1301961600,Murray River flake salt,Mmmmm!  Mmmmm!  This salt has a wonder flavor and I am addicted to using it for a finishing product.  Very much recommend that you try.
24775,B001BOAOQ4,A36WGHR8TO5DKT,Goldwave shopper,2/2,1257292800,A Permanent Replacement to Other Candies in our House,I decided to try these in the hopes of finding a good organic and sugarless option.  These are wonderful!  I tried both the Pomegranate and Cherry flavors. and like them both.  Instead of sugar. these are sweetened with cane juice.  This adds a very slight flavor note. which enhances the appeal. giving these a bit more complexity and interest than the typical sugary-sweet hard candies.  The fruit flavor is definitely predominant and comes through loud and clear.  These last a long time. don't burn the roof of my mouth (like some hard candies do). and don't seem to get soft and sticky after residing in my purse for a while. like most hard candies do.  These are a standard item in my household now!
24792,B007NWHPJW,A2VDZCT1O06WRS,LucyShoe,1/2,1334188800,Strong!,If you like STRONG coffee then this is the brew for you. It smells great. permeating every corner of the house as it brews.
24811,B0021L8XTG,A1P91BNTGGDSG8,Linda Gableman,0/0,1335744000,Popular at my house,I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her. and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter. but the dogs can chew off smooth bits. which they eat. This brand of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them.
24836,B000G0EP78,A29313797NGT9L,Eddie Wannabee,4/4,1289520000,4.5 Stars For Sure!,Carbquik sounded too good to be true. but the price in Amazon (and I am surprised at this for isn't Amazon supposed to be the leader in good deals? Or did I just dream that?) is way too high. I have a need to cut down considerably on my carbs consumption and being the bread lover and all things requiring flour. really. I was amazed when I read this flour had 90% less carbs than the leading brand (would that be bisquick?). So I bought a box. no sense in wasting money if it was not going to deliver on the promise. and the very first thing I did was a Banana Nut Bread. It came out very tasty but please note the ingredients besides the flour have a lot to do with the final result. Used EasySweet and brown sugar Splenda instead of regular sugar. walnuts pecans and sliced almonds. cinnamon. heavy cream. etc and did about 3 loaves of what I can easily substitute for any banana bread found in my local supermarket. So that was a score! Next. I tried my luck making oatmeal cookies and these came out pretty tasty and I kept asking myself: Have I really created the ultimate. guilt free. less stress oatmeal cookie?. This is not a perfect mix. by any means. but compared to what is being offered they seem to be one company that cares for that particular segment and equally deserving. in my opinion. of individuals such as myself and their needs and desires. That alone always elicits an emotional response on my part. I have been known to shed a tear or two of joy in my warm kitchen as I see the final products greeting me hello. Did Waffles and they also came out pretty tasty. have to make sure the ingredients and the recipe are bullet proof. I like to mix the flour with lots of cinnamon which according to science is a great glucose equalizer (did anybody said sugar challenged?. perhaps it is time to realize that sugar can take your joy away together with your teeth. if consumed avidly. which is the way I always consume it until now). So I went to netrition.com where I also buy some very good low carb varieties and was happy with the box. So much. in fact. that I just ordered a new one. I envision a day when the wonderful people of this great country will be able to enjoy sweets without the mortifying thought that it is not too healthy for such nice beings. So Carbquik works and if their nutritional information is accurate it is also a much welcome relief into a world where very little attention is paid and given to the needs and desires of people with some kind of restrictions. Now. don't get me wrong. that does not mean we (I count myself in the list) need to settle for subpar. less appealing product just because the situation demands it. No no no. like the song goes: you can have your cake and it too (bob dylan lay lady lay?) and that is exactly what I am intending on doing these Holidays. known for their tempting treats. Carbquik worked for me and I tip my hat (for a bold head must always be protected) to the makers of this helpful product. Not quite 5 Stars but 4.5 Stars For Sure! Happy Holidays and please make sure to compensate all the eating with a walk. swim or a run!
24838,B000G0EP78,A245UUHQOLXF6L,Lillyanne_M,3/3,1329264000,really good-if you follow directions,I was very dubious that this stuff would be any good when I bought it. but I just finished making the cheese biscuit recipe on the box and I am AMAZED.  Seriously. they are so good- even my kids like them; they couldn't tell they were low-carb.  They were soft. light. and buttery like the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster.  I wouldn't recommend using the plain ol' water and carbquick biscuit recipe.  Even if you use real Bisquick. those biscuits are NEVER going to be any good.  Anyone who has made biscuits from scratch knows they have to have a lot of fat in them- either butter or shortening- to be edible.  And you have to stop messing with the dough as soon as everything is moist enough to stick together- don't knead it at all or you'll wind up with hocky pucks.  Anyway.  follow the directions. measure accurately and don't cut corners- margarine?? yuck!  The recipe says to use butter. so don't complain if you don't follow directions and you wind up with a mess.<br /><br />I'll be making the pancakes tomorrow- can't wait!! It's been probably at least a year since I had pancakes...<br /><br />BTW- A couple of reviews on here have been bad because it's too pricey- but that's not really fair.  This price on Amazon is more than twice the price I got mine for elsewhere- that's not Carbquick's fault. As with anything. you have to shop around.
24850,B000G0EP78,A25QHZN4HBOP6N,Bakermommy,1/1,1323734400,Great base product,Any baker can tweak Carbquick to fit their expectations. Much simplier than working with individual formulas. Bonus. I got a shot of Amazon's price and my local health food store was happy to beat it and they deliver 2 boxes to me every 3 wks. Just like amazon's subscription service. Since this is such a lo carb staple it was worth setting up a cheaper option.
24854,B000G0EP78,A23G6RY3F2VIIC,Indigo,1/1,1279756800,Wonderful,This product is great! I would recommend purchasing xanthan gum as well. because it isn't as stable as Bisquick in the dough holding together. just a tiny bit works wonders. As mentioned before. it can be purchased for less than half the price from Netrition. The blueberry muffins are delicious. and I use regular Bisquick recipes substituting Carbquik and sugar substitute and have had no bad results.
24855,B000G0EP78,A2YMCPP3KW9IXU,USMC85,1/1,1279411200,We have to have Carbquik in our home,This makes much better pizza than the ready made whole wheat pizza crusts that you buy in the stores. First of all. Carbquik takes about 15 minutes to cook. so the vegetables and cheese have enough time to cook and blend together. And knowing that it has 90 percent less carbohydrates doesn't make me feel guilty when I have a pizza craving. I don't feel bloated and sick like I do after I engorge myself on a fast food pizza. Carbquik is the base of a healthy pizza that makes me feel good after eating it. We have reordered many times and always have several boxes in reserve.
24867,B000G0EP78,A1JNOIWKZNHZ0M,Davis L. Bowen,0/0,1310601600,So-so,It's really expensive and doesn't taste all that good.  The cheddar biscuit recipe is about the only thing that was edible that I could make.  I have a box that's been sitting untouched in the pantry for the past year.
24881,B001EQ5OYQ,A3YX39WIXLT9J,Steven Kelm,6/7,1289260800,Nasty crap.,I have trouble believing that what is in the package is truly dried fruit.  Dried poop maybe?  These are downright awful - the smell. the texture. the smell. the taste. oh and did I mention the smell.  I have smelled outhouses and mall bathrooms that are more appealing.
24909,B0078Y6OX8,A38J0F87AYEA7Y,Biloxireb,0/0,1294963200,Yummy,This has to be one of my favorite coffees. It's really like eating a chocolate truffle! It's also not an overwhelming chocolate flavor. I don't really like mocha flavors. I gave my mom half of my order and she loves it too! I will definitely order more!

24924,B0078Y6OX8,AL7N0L8AI7NH3,Pete,0/0,1288742400,Best Flavor - Super Convenient,Of all the K-Cup flavors we've brewed. this is the best.  It is so good that we have actually subscribed (15% discount!) to receive these boxes every couple months.  The flavor is great and it is extremely convenient in the morning to just pop the K-Cup in our brewer and 15 seconds later we have a hot cup of coffee.
24935,B0078Y6OX8,A2OGLU2YDBK0LK,memamema,0/0,1286928000,More Creme Brulee Flavor for me,The coffee is good but I think that the creme brulee flavor is lacking....
24949,B0078Y6OX8,A1UGERTP9PHV8Q,Del-Hyway,0/0,1281398400,Need some cream and sugar,I drink my coffee black and like some flavor now and then. but with this I need to add cream and sugar to enjoy it.  But. when I do add creamer. it is very nice.
24954,B0078Y6OX8,A15B4G97DLZ12S,buddha,0/0,1277424000,Van Houtte chocolage rasberry  K-Cup,This coffee has a wonderful aroma.  I usually don't drink coffee with cream and sugar but I like this particular flavor better with a little cream and sugar.
24964,B0078Y6OX8,A1Q8ZJ0L9VHQUB,Marilyn Reed chamarette,1/2,1292630400,Van Houtee Creme Brulee coffee is a winner for a cold pick-me-up,I've been trying to duplicate Baskin Robbins Capuccino Blasts for years. So I have come close using this Keurig coffee cup. then add a little artificial sweetener. a tablespoon of Hillsbrothers English toffee mix and a little heavy whipping cream. Once the coffee is brewed I mixe everything together and let it cool off and then stick the freezer safe glass in the freezer for an hour or so until the mixture is almost frozen. Then add some crushed ice and have a delicious cold drink. I am not fond of hot coffee. but love this refreshing drink when I need a pick me up.
24969,B0078Y6OX8,A307NGYTUX25YV,Pam S-G Pam S-G,0/1,1301616000,Disappointed. My Expectations May Have Been Unrealistic...,I don't like the taste. which perhaps can be expected -- I'm not a big coffee drinker.  However. my daughter. who likes coffee. didn't like it either and says she'd rather go without than drink it again.<br /><br />My expectations were for a very chocolate/raspberry flavored coffee drink.  What I got was a harsh coffee taste with a slight aroma of raspberry and maybe a hint of chocolate.  I didn't taste the raspberry or chocolate at all.
24972,B0078Y6OX8,ABAHKMFEHT8K1,Gerald Balmes Jerry B,0/1,1272326400,Nothing French or Vanilla about this,I have liked all of the Van Houtte Kcups I have tried; except this one. Though the coffee wasn't bad in itself. I could not detect and vanilla flavor at all. Though this blend was smooth and had little to no bitterness; I expected a vanilla like flavor and detected none.
24981,B0078Y6OX8,A2JE8OS1NN9YDB,Space Queen,3/3,1275436800,Yummy French Vanilla K-Cups,I love this coffee with cream and sugar-free caramel syrup (with Splenda).  It has a smooth taste...perfect for my morning coffee.
24987,B0078Y6OX8,A1B09PBLHBGS38,theproudtexan,4/5,1283817600,Good coffee. but not at all Creme Brulee-y,I love creme brulee. If I were to drown in a vat of it. I think that'd be a pretty good way to go. So. naturally. when I see something that is flavored like creme brulee but without the calories. I get excited.<br /><br />I got excited about this coffee.<br /><br />Now. it's good coffee. as far as coffee goes. Nothing wrong with that. But if someone served me this and asked me to identify the flavor. creme brulee wouldn't even make it on the list. It's almost got a bitter taste to it -- even Splenda didn't help much.<br /><br />Unfortunately. I ordered two boxes and will be lucky if I get through one. Guess I'll sell the other one on ebay or something. Dunno. What I *do* know is that I won't be drinking it.
24990,B0078Y6OX8,A3PVMP81ZG0S7B,JwB BookBuddy,1/1,1325462400,Darn Good Coffee,I've always been so so on coffee. I love flavored drinks and I like the IDEA of flavored coffees. But the reality never measured up to the hype for me. But this coffee is really good. It smells fantastic when it's brewing and the taste is spot on. Obviously to bring out the flavor you need to add sweeteners because both the main flavors in this are sweet. But whether I use cream and sugar or White Chocolate Raspberry creamer (my favorite way) it's a good cup of coffee. I have had this in the morning as well as for a dessert coffee. If you like flavored coffees that aren't either watery or overwhelmingly strong. you'll like this one.
24994,B0078Y6OX8,A1MEVBD79PNUI7,Molly A. Wall,1/1,1290729600,Great aroma and taste,Great flavor. and the aroma is fantastic. If you enjoy flavored coffees at all. you must try this. A winner and a keeper.
25018,B0078Y6OX8,A42O0C4YO2XKA,stodorof,2/3,1293580800,A bit weak for me. smells great!,This coffee does smell wonderful (mostly of raspberry and not so much the chocolate) but it tastes weak to me.  I usually prefer a donut shop taste (middle of the road for boldness) and was disappointed that this tasted a bit watered down.  I will not be purchasing it again.
25031,B0078Y6OX8,AG2S7N7ZPPNW2,jeciwall28,0/0,1325116800,Not for me,I love all things Raspberry and Chocolate. but this did not do it for me. I don't like strong coffee and WOW is this strong. I only drank one cup out of a box of 48 k-cups.
25050,B0078Y6OX8,A4RR6QMZZNTPB,Andi,0/0,1301443200,Yumm!,I almost returned my cuisinart single cup brewer because I couldn't find any flavors as good as the Chocolate Raspberry that I would buy as whole beans from Gloria Jeans - then I found this.  Smells wonderful and tastes great.  My new fav.
25070,B0081XIA1E,A1YASP0X0HUPOS,bayaroja,0/0,1341705600,Cut my dog's mouth :-(,As a previous reviewer stated. the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5 deep. 2 1/8 wide and 2 1/4 long. Seems big enough. but it wasn't. Additionally. only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats. but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept. but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow.
25075,B0081XIA1E,A1YP7ELTTTLP7M,krista,0/0,1333065600,Great for slowing down feeding time!,This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle. but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.  I fill all four compartments up with kibble.  I holds about 2 cups of food. and it extends eating time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes.  Which means less gas for my dog and sweeter air for me.
25082,B0081XIA1E,A3G7TXOQH23AMA,Dominique,0/0,1326931200,only good for the first use. buy a treat ball,My dog figured this out really fast and likes it a lot. However. it's over priced since my dog can get to the treats fast and he's a fast eater. I would suggest investing in a treat ball instead. That'll keep there attention longer and they are similarly priced.
25094,B0081XIA1E,A11XHE9SEWGQBG,preebhat,0/0,1324080000,Great interactive toy for dogs!,My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese. half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup. In the beginning. she was pawing at it. Finally she figured out a way to remove the cup with her mouth. Within ten minutes she was able to find all the hidden treats. After this exercise. she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation. she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration. she would have given up. Now. this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups. I didn't know if this would be too big for her mouth. but she has no problems. This is a great toy and a fun way to keep your dog stimulated and active.
25102,B0081XIA1E,A1TA2N389HSCV,Owner of Sweet Dee,0/0,1298073600,Keeps the puppy entertained,Good concept to keep our puppy entertained.  Quality is alright. but we do not leave it out for her. as she can easily chew the plastic apart.
25110,B0081XIA1E,AZ26CDSJ363AH,nycgirl nycgirl,23/23,1305244800,too easy. even for not-so-smart dogs,i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy. and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund. who. although adorable. is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item. my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately. I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See. If you spin the star just 20 degrees. *all* the treat trays are exposed. and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However. my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser.  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys. i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.
25132,B0081XIA1E,A14YN21RCE9O3L,Auburn Sky,2/2,1318982400,Think of this not as a puzzle or toy but more of an interactive feeder,I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well. challenging or not. this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix. he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings. his appetite would pick up.  Well. it didn't.  After two months. he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough. I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy. he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So. for our dog. it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far. has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!
25137,B0081XIA1E,A3EM40VV41YOHH,A. Staley,2/2,1294099200,Love it!,My dogs love this puzzle and I think have a lot of fun with it. This is the 3rd dog puzzle I've bought(each were different brands). and this one has been the easiest so far. My one dog caught on to all the puzzles right away but my other dog is a slow learner and it took him a while to get how the other two we had worked. but with this one. he didn't need any help and figured out how to get the treats right away.
25139,B0081XIA1E,A1963SA8X835YL,Bay Cities,2/2,1293494400,Great Toy to get dogs thinking!,I have two rat terriers. and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.  Their main drive in life is to eat. and then play. so this was perfect.  I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.  It took them about 10-15 minutes of playing. barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.  Great toy Kyjen!<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup
25164,B0081XIA1E,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,Elizabeth Renee Blue,0/0,1350864000,Reviews for the Treat triad. Paw Hide. and Star Spinner,Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still. a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging. as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO. the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall. I don't find them to be that challenging. except for the Treat Triad but that one. I think. has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.
25187,B0081XIA1E,AM7PICL3IVQAP,t_love,0/0,1343606400,5 seconds flat,I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.
25204,B000FZRYPO,A2T569NC1657PU,Bettina,1/1,1295136000,Delicious,We ordered this because we just started the Belly Fat Cure Diet and we both think it is fantastic. I don't think I will ever eat. by choice. any other pasta. It is fantastic. When I was little. 70 years ago. my grandmother would make pasta for Sunday dinners.. eating this pasta reminded me of my Grandma's pasta.... delicious
25206,B000FZRYPO,A2QYP9LCID5O5S,San Perry,1/1,1258243200,A GREAT LOWER CARB PASTA,If you're watching your carbs and miss egg noodles. Carba Nada is a good replacement. It isn't greatly low carb. but quite a bit less than regular pasta. so you need to watch serving sizes. but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well. The different flavours add more variety. and its also easy to toss with some butter. parmesan. and seasonings. Add leftover chicken or beef. and some vegetables. and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs.

I believe they were a case of 12.  These were the best crumbs ever.  Nice and crunching when baking chicken and wonderful in the fry pan as well.<br />Sadly the panko crumbs in the plastic container were unavailable at this time when I last checked.<br />These were really the ones ones I can comment on to be excellent.

25290,B001P28DHY,A3MH3QGC42XZ1U,pointlomachic,2/2,1318896000,Smooth and Delicious!,I was on the hunt for a Swiss Water Process decaf and happened to come across this low acid variety from HealthWise. I am very. very happy with my choice. I also purchased a Melita decaf as well. and thought it to be too strong. This coffee is as decaffeinated as it gets! No jitters. even on those days I have more than 2 cups. I highly recommend it to any coffee lovers who can no longer enjoy the caffeine and who would like to avoid the chemicals associated with traditional decaf.
25299,B001P28DHY,A3I6J5XFJW8ELI,Debra Lynn Costanzo &34;Health Coach&34;,4/6,1294185600,HealthWise Decaf Coffee,I do not particularly care for this coffee. However. in all fairness to the product - this was my last ditch effort to find a decaf coffee that I like. I truly enjoy regular Colombian. organic coffee. I have tried other. non-organic decafs before and was dissatisfied. I thought maybe an organic version would suit my taste buds. Considering that I always find decaf coffees less than enjoyable. please do not take my review as gospel. I would recommend that anyone who is trying to reduce their caffeine intake should try this product and make up your own mind. I only drink 1 1/2 cups of coffee in the morning. So. I'm not abusing caffeine. However. I think I just enjoy the flavor of real coffee too  much to enjoy the taste of straight decaf. Currently. I'm doing a scoop of regular organic coffee and a scoop of HealthWise. At least I'm getting closer to my caffeine free goal. :-)

25421,B004ECVRNO,A2FBCSL9BUDS51,Jennifer Elliott Jenn,1/3,1332115200,This is nasty!!! Even if you like pepper on your sandwich! Beware!,I totally agree with the reviewer who said this mayo is wayyy to hot!! I bought this mayo for my boyfriend who loves pepper with his sandwiches. I was alittle skeptical because I like pepper but not alot. So I reluctantly bought this because I really like the regular olive oil mayo.<br />I was the first one to try this mayo. I had made me a club sandwich with turkey. turkey bacon. avocado. tomatoes. green leaf lettuce and then this mayo... The only thing I tasted was this mayo!!! It overpowered the whole sandwich. I didnt even use that much either... I was starving so I choked down this sandwich. Then I sat and drank. drank. drank some more just to get the pepper out of my mouth!! This was horrible...<br />Then I gave some to my boyfriend to try and he spit it out!! He was like man what are you trying to do. poison me with pepper! I told him that is the mayo you had me buy with the cracked pepper in it. He said throw that jar away and get the regular olive oil mayo. This stuff is nasty!!<br />I understand that everyone has their own opinion of food but this is really hot and overpowering with pepper. Like one reviewer said that it has cracked pepper in it so why would you buy it if you dont like pepper. I like pepper and my boyfriend loves pepper but this went in the trash!

These little toddler meals are simple. easy. and best of all. loved by my little munchkin (17 months old).  She lives two hours away with her mother. who is in college. so I send these meals to her apartment so that she has them there. as well as when she's with me (every other week).  They may be a little costly and not on a college student's budget. but I'm happy to ensure that my little munchkin has healthy meals that she loves and that make her feel independent (she can feed them to hershelf).  The size of the meat and carrots and green beans are perfect for a toddler.
25441,B0051TPWUI,AM9LRYG6YXV83,P. Verkhovensky uebermensch,5/5,1212451200,Unique product. well executed,The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal. yet they are filling and healthy. containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket. but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS. EVAPORATED CANE JUICE. BROWN SUGAR. CORN MALTODEXTRIN. CINNAMON. NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows. I don't think this is true.

Excellent snack with protein.<br /><br />Just ordered some more of them.

They would probably be my favorite almond. but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that. right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

25500,B0051TPWUI,A3HXME9ZRYK5P,Allan W. Brinkmeyer,1/6,1278028800,NOT as good as the ones in the tins,Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case. I picked up these in hope that oven roasted + honey = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky. but there are no milk products listed. which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However. my 6 year old really likes them and. while I don't have a container to compare. I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

I grabbed one from a candy bowl and walked out. thinking it would be a mint.  But when I popped it in. the intense anise flavor bursting throughout my mouth. I immediately wanted to turn around and grab a handful.  They're absolutely delicious. they cleanse your palette. and make your breath smell like sweet licorice.

It's more flavor and texture than my earlier experience with this brand.<br />I have eaten it dry more as an evening snack. The packaging was in a strong carton<br />within a shipping carton. There is cereal dust in the cups so it likely settles from motion.

25602,B005CGUTIA,A2SVGOCXJ14JAT,djenn,0/0,1325980800,Not The Same as Store bought??,Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip. as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So. I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size. but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!
25609,B0002HDLZM,A4PT2IMOHIE1F,Jonathan Miller,9/10,1231459200,Product Good. Service Lacking,There was nothing wrong with the pastries--everyone seemed to like them. so you'll be fine as long as they don't mess up your order.<br /><br />I ordered two boxes of pastries for Christmas gifts. but the shipping was slower than expected and. more importantly. they only sent *ONE* of the two boxes.  I tried calling them and got a recording--figuring they were probably just busy because of the time of year. I also sent them two e-mails.  So far I have not heard back.  The shipping label was attached directly to the SINGLE pastry box (rather that being affixed to a larger cardboard box that could possibly hold two) and said BOX 1 of 1. so I know it wasn't a delivery service problem.  They simply only shipped one of the two boxes that I ordered.<br /><br />Mistakes can happen to any company. but the fact that they are hard to get in touch with and won't return my e-mails is just poor customer service.
25614,B0002HDLZM,AEA2F5DN3TVM,N. Weiss,1/1,1279152000,The very best!,I ordered these mixed pastries 4 days ago. and they are sooo good! I was worried about shipping during the summer. especially since I live in Louisiana and these were coming all the way from MI.  But. they arrived in 2 days after I ordered and were in perfect condition.  (That was w/ expedited FexEx shipping)<br /><br />I have to say that this was the best mix of baklava that I have ever had. and I have tried a lot.  They tasted very fresh also. My boyfriend is from Egypt so these were for him. and he enjoyed them too.  I will definitley order again. I only wish that we were closer to the bakery!
25626,B006QXXWGY,A3T4BE3PODFSS3,Pat T,3/3,1344038400,So happy - they are so good!,I was so excited to find these dairy free white chocolate chips on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!!!  I received the shipment yesterday and this morning for breakfast I made oatmeal. cranberry and white chocolate chip cookies.  They were so good! The white chocolate chips melted into the cookie making each mouthful a wonderful treat. These chips were everything I was hoping for.  I will most definitely be keeping my pantry stocked with these chips.

25630,B0002DJXRQ,AY54QSGO3KWEM,Legalsea,8/8,1271894400,Excellent Sugar-Free Thousand Island Dressing,I have used Walden Farms' products before. Indeed. one of my favorite salad dressings by them is the 'Bacon Ranch' calorie-free. fat-free and sugar-free salad dressing (two tablespoons is a serving and has Zero calories).<br /><br />That said. I found this particular product. the Walden Farms Sugar-Free Thousand-Island salad dressing. at a grocery store the other day: I loved it so much I returned and bought three more bottles.<br /><br />Mind. it is not calorie or fat free: a serving (again. two tablespoons) has 40 calories with 4 grams of fat (zero saturated). However. it tastes. to me. so much like one of the 'premium' salad dressings (with much. much more fat. as well as sugar) that I feel the splurge is worth it.<br /><br />I came here to Amazon to see if they had it cheaper. but I see that it is currently unavailable. I will keep an eye out for it.<br /><br />Final note: Walden Farms products can range from 'ugh' to 'wow'. For instance. I love the Bacon Ranch calorie free dressing. yet hated the 'Ranch' (no bacon) calorie free dressing. With this company you simply must try everything at least once. and you are sure to find several items you will enjoy.
25631,B0002DJXRQ,A34LILWGBUXLIJ,Steven Grimm,5/5,1139961600,One of their better ones,I've tried a bunch of Walden Farms dressings. and this is one of the better ones. It tastes like a decent (not great. but decent) regular thousand-island dressing. It makes a good dip for celery. I've given this to people and not told them it's diet dressing. and haven't had anyone ask about it. If it were a non-diet dressing I'd give it 3 stars for flavor. but considering the small number of calories (the zero on the label means less than 5 per serving -- thanks. FDA) it's pretty impressive.
25645,B000V1RBSC,AMCPGM71EFOU7,R. Souza,1/3,1290384000,Not So Good  -Don't Scratch and Sniff-,Well. I wish this mix was as good as reflected in the other reviews.<br />Tried the waffle recipe from the package. I guess we're not used to the healthy ingredients. Not such an appetizing taste or texture and the cooking waffles make a decidedly unpleasant smell. Funky. burned corn and whole wheat aroma? Lingered for hours.<br />In addition the waffle recipe calls for 1 cup of mix and does not make even 2 whole waffles in a standard sized maker. Not the usual waffle expansion or fluffiness but hey it's healthy.<br /><br />Will need to come up with suitable additions or this stuff will go unused or well maybe the birds will get a treat.<br />Or not...
25663,B0015R9BQG,A18LEJPZEFCXHO,A. Kaul,0/0,1202256000,Excellent!,These are a much tastier than the other flavors. though they are a little softer.

Texas BBQ sounded like an awesome flavor---so I bought them. For those of you who have never tried them....pick up a rubber band. baste it in bbq sauce and then eat. That is what this soy protein jerky taste like...a bbq flavored rubber band. The only way I will ever eat these again is if the world no longer has any other protein choice available.
25691,B0015R9BQG,AS8B1BPUTP6AR,Amber,1/7,1299196800,Don't Buy. Nothing like Teriyaki Jerky,I became a vegetarian about three years ago. and before that. Teriyaki was my favorite flavor of beef jerky. So when I saw this. I immediately bought it. However. this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy. and tasted like bread. and the supposed Teriyaki flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it. so I'm returning it. If you buy. I guarantee you'll be sorry.
25699,B0015R9BQG,A3J4NARZK4Q4PX,Shantastic,7/8,1224547200,Suprisingly yummy...great texture!,My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy. convenient protein packed snack.

I've been a vegetarian for 13 years and I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian meat replacement foods.  These strips definitely work for me. I keep a couple in my car to snack on when I don't have time to stop and eat.  The texture is so meat-like you will question yourself and re-read the ingredients to be sure is isn't made from animal flesh. I bought a case of the Texas BBQ and a case of the Hickory Smoked.

25709,B0015R9BQG,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,Jessica Snyder,2/2,1338940800,I wanted so much to like it!,First. I expected this to be like dry jerky.  This was wet and soggy with a spongy texture.  There is something so off putting about the flavor. it's like wet dog food.  The first bite seemed okay. but I could not finish it even though it was small.  Regretfully. I decided to buy this anyway based on the reviews... I read all the one star reviews and thought Heyyyy now. it can't be that bad! These people must be clueless. they must be expecting it to taste like real jerky. of course it's not!  I was soooo wrong.
25734,B0015R9BQG,A2TCY4Q5S0NO5Z,Mira L. Shanks F.R.O.G.,1/1,1196553600,Tasty!,I was happy to see that I could purchase this on Amazon. Previously had to go to our local health food store. Price is about the same. more convenient to come to the house. High protein. low fat. tasty and give a energy boost on intense bike rides or anytime snack when you don't want a carb rush! :)
25735,B0015R9BQG,AE1ZME0QHI8U,L. Johnson,1/1,1189296000,ok product really sloooooww shipping,I too think these strips are a bit too sweet - but this one has 10 grams of protein. Now the that prices have gone up. it's close to what I would pay in the one store in my town that sells them. It also took weeks to get them with the free shipping.  So hmm...
25763,B0015R9BQG,A177LV2Y3TEPM3,Anonymous,0/0,1304899200,Good texture. bad taste,I'm not a vegetarian. but I have trouble finding decent jerky and decided to try the Texas BBQ flavor. I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture. but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums. but that's true with all meat. Besides texture. it also tasted like meat. However. it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet. and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though. so they're not completely wasted.
25798,B001HTND2K,ALWOBUKI4Q5IK,TomoDachi212 TomoDachi212,10/13,1277337600,The description is a lie,I ordered this expecting to receive. Lorina Sparkling Lemonade . 11.1-Ounce (Pack of 12)is a six-flavor gourmet selection. as it states clearly in the description and shows clearly in the photo.  I received a 12-pack of one variety only.  In fact. I ordered two variety packs and received two packs of the same variety.  These people are liars and I expect them to re-ship what they say they are selling.
25811,B003LTPY08,AD28DT80OK93,River Book-smart Blonde,0/0,1335916800,Blueberry is disappointing,I actually ordered these because I wanted to try the blueberry without buying a full box of it.  I was disappointed that there were less blueberry cups. but that was my own fault because it says so in the description.  Of course. since I didn't like the blueberry. maybe it was for the better.  The other three flavors are pretty standard.  I gave it four stars because even though these aren't my favorite flavors. that's just my opinion.  Product wise. they are everything they should be.
25815,B003LTPY08,A3DHT45GC4FNPV,Katie,0/0,1328918400,love Green Mountain!,Green mountain makes great coffee and great K-cups. I got these on sale and got a great deal. I like having the variety and not one whole box of the same flavor. I would d efinitely buy this again.
25820,B003LTPY08,A2LL1XR4NTBJWI,Helene S. Carman,0/0,1308614400,Green Mountain Flavored Variety K-cups,I am really enjoying the K-cup Green Mountain variety pack.  The only problem is the taste isn't strong enough for me when taken without sugar or some other sweetener which is how I usually take my coffee.
25821,B003LTPY08,A3TY2JLV65FQ69,E. Hitchcock Country Jewel,0/0,1301270400,Great variety pack!,I just got a Keurig coffee maker as a gift and bought this variety pack just to get a small sample of the coffee they offer. Excellent flavors!! Will definitely buy again!
25827,B003LTPY08,AGBWOFK4S7IOQ,England86,9/15,1297814400,OVER PRICED,I can't believe anyone is buying this stuff at Amazon!!!  Go to Keurig.com and pay half of this price.  Spread the word because this is rediculous!
25872,B000BGZNXW,A2JKIVXWKX1B73,C. Clark cclark,1/1,1335657600,Decent pump. but not universal,So I bought this to use with my 750ml Torani syrup because the description states it's a universal fit for these bottles. However. the cap is too wide and the straw was too long. I ended up cutting the straw to fit and wrapping plastic around the top so the cap will fit. The price was cheap so I didn't feel like returning it.
25882,B000EVMNNC,AP8JWRAMSNPDN,Robert Welborn,2/2,1229472000,Great flavor!,If you like pink grapefruit. you will love this product! I am a huge pink grapefruit lover and I really didn't expect a lot when I decided to buy these and give them a try...THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!<br /><br />They look like a grapefruit section. and they are coated with sugar. These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!<br /><br />Other people have said that they are good in small doses. but I wouldn't want more than 5-6 pieces at a time anyway. or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!
25891,B000EVMNNC,A1W28XHOWQHP5Q,Lisa M. Duff Lisa,1/1,1191542400,Yummy!,We had a candy buffet as a favor at our wedding.  We needed pink. brown and white candy (our wedding colors) so this was a perfect choice.  I only had a few but they were yummy and fresh.  People were commenting on how good they were!  Amazon had the best price and shipping was free and fast.
25929,B00024D8RG,A3H0K82OLZDRDT,DocsGirl,0/1,1299628800,Awful,It was awful and didn't really taste like barbecue sauce at all.  It had quite a sour flavor.  I actually really enjoy intense flavors of all different kinds of spices but I actually threw this bottle out after trying it.  Don't waste your money.
25953,B001FA1KXU,A1SGBCM7XUC5HF,diamond punky,11/14,1267315200,none such mincemeat,This was a very hard to find item and was very pleased with the service I received
25965,B000Y8Y8HY,A2V201N29W955R,Crabbypatty,0/0,1327795200,pocket coffee,This is the perfect way to have coffee in the middle of a work day. When working in reatil. one doesn't always have time to take a cofee break. This pocket coffee allows you to just pop it in your mouth and get back to work. Love it!
25995,B001IZJO76,A87YQIMOR3W1M,Glennie P. Metz,0/0,1314662400,Love to chew this gum!,This bubble gum does not stick to my partials. I have been chewing this gum for the past 10 years. it is my drug of choice. It relaxes me after a hard day in the office.
26011,B0058AMY74,A2BLJGGWN8GTXQ,Sean,0/0,1325721600,Salty and vinegary!!!,These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor. but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally. as other reviewers have said. they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).
26024,B0058AMY74,A3Q5YZNYGGUP8W,cppme,0/0,1290297600,Crunchy and Tasty,These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags. just the right amount of chips.
26040,B0058AMY74,A1DW1FK1H3F2TM,EuReka,0/0,1231977600,These are AWESOME!,These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time!
26042,B0058AMY74,A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,Jared Castle,0/0,1231718400,Crunchy. salty. sweet...finally. a Superbowl snack that scooores!,These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty. tangy. sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor. which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.<br /><br />These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans. coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally. they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian. I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends. especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color. rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats. MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA>Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM>Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon. a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote. ...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy. so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also. a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger. lime. garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically. a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.
26049,B0058AMY74,A3UCO7B9HP42BG,Denise Graner,0/0,1217203200,Great chips,We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken. always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!
26053,B0058AMY74,A324FVIOYCWNSB,Eric BVD Eric,0/0,1215302400,An addictive potato chip,Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty.
26054,B0058AMY74,A1RRHET1QIP1YK,Daniel Hill,0/0,1215302400,Great Chip!,I don't eat many chips. but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away. so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet. hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee.
26061,B0058AMY74,A31N6KB160O508,Fran W.,0/0,1214006400,Firm quality chip,Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me. if it is there.
26082,B0058AMY74,A39Y59C6FTC0GL,Christine,1/2,1247788800,Love Kettle Chips. but not this flavor!,I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
26086,B0058AMY74,A2C18CH1YC6BYT,Sophie,0/1,1314403200,Crisp,I love these chips. which is why I bought them. to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great. and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters. with holes and complely squished... I don't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage. but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily. there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be.
26098,B0058AMY74,A27C44BIRQH3QW,Stan Miastkowski,13/15,1185580800,The Best Chips...PERIOD!,You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through. instead of being masked. OK. so they're still a snack food. but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am). having these available means I can eat chips. and Kettle are just the best.
26100,B0058AMY74,A13SOXNMWXQVNU,ClickmeClickme,4/4,1231632000,Chip snob alert!,It feels strange to review chips. but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag. plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.<br /><br />Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.<br /><br />Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream. some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best.
26118,B0058AMY74,A3GJQ3W0T0KWEO,tatcol tatcol,0/2,1328918400,USED to be my favorite chips,Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily. crunchy. flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now they're no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P.. Kettle Brand chips. :(
26119,B0058AMY74,A1PGMT8XLL4FPM,TZ1 GUY,0/2,1328400000,Stale. Rancid Oil Taste. And if You Like Even the Tiniest Bit of Salt Flavor on Your Chips...,...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers. these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging peanuts. Positively awful. no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great premium brand. literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting. and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!
26127,B0058AMY74,ATZ0P4653KL13,The REAL Radiodude,1/5,1284768000,Not so good.,If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch. but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have just a touch.
26139,B0058AMY74,A1GBZCL326K4GN,GFCFmom GFCFmom,7/9,1192406400,A tang that packs a punch!,My daughter that has autism craves hot. spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked.
26155,B0058AMY74,A2A8KWCE8RKB9T,David Glazer,1/1,1348704000,Good chips,I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
26156,B0058AMY74,A27GRVH9ZJGXLT,patent_lawyer,1/1,1348185600,Awesome,If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
26166,B0058AMY74,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,Steven A. Peterson,1/1,1306540800,Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .,My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago. and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First. Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips. as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second. individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third. the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot. of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not. have no kick. and are as bland as can be. Here. you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still. decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all. I have been pretty happy with this product. in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .
26179,B0058AMY74,A2TMSO255FQBBU,Brian H. Goldberg,1/1,1218758400,Some of the best chips anywhere,Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips. and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have. and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack.
26180,B0058AMY74,A20ORC60J05BP3,M. Novak,1/1,1217289600,the defacto standard for Salt and Vinegar chips,I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these. the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar. these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares.
26184,B0058AMY74,A1LA5T5SXLGFZQ,Halcyon Moses GoGreenMart&More.com,1/1,1215129600,YUMMY!,Kettle Foods. Inc. makes the best tasting potato chips I've ever eaten.  With a variety of flavors. from classic Barbeque to their unique Spicy Thai you'll find the right flavor for your mouth. And not only do they taste wonderful. but these all-natural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterol.<br /><br />But why is it a GoGreenMart&More product of the week? Kettle Foods. Inc. is a Green Giant. a company highlighted for their environmental practices.  They convert waste oils to biodiesel to power some of their company cars.

26190,B0058AMY74,A37D5847LN3WQ,Wildcat Fan,3/4,1211414400,Best Chips Out There!,These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.
26199,B0058AMY74,A3TA1UJWRJF9NC,jschristian44,2/3,1283472000,4 Stars for price and taste,I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways. my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging. also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all. and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So. for the price and how many you get. these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these. 4 stars.
26208,B0058AMY74,A1I29JSIGJNWKH,John G. Edwards homiedog,0/0,1347062400,I made a mistake.....,This may sound rediculous. but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order. I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked. and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But. it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips. and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!). I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips. and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho. Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely.<br /><br />  § homiedog §
26216,B000ST9GCQ,A1OHDRFL6BXJEN,Noah Kimmel,4/4,1234137600,not bad,this set certaintly will make you enough cups of coffee (nearly 100). As for taste and quality. ita not bad. a little thick. but if you need to have instant. I would be fine with having this everyday.
26224,B000ST9GCQ,ALX50DFCW06A2,Nadja L. Russell,1/1,1267228800,Cuppa Joe,When you live by yourself. a pot of coffee is a waste of money.  These little sticks fit the bill though.  No need to wash a big ol' coffee pot or have it take up counter space and nothing to plug in. just pour water and drink.  You can make it as strong or as weak as you want.  Thanks Tasters Choice!
26237,B000ST9GCQ,AR8T5HFGMG7BH,Marty A. Edrington Jr. martizzle,0/8,1303948800,Terrible,I am by no means a coffee expert. but you would have to have a string of mental conditions to prefer this coffee over mud in a cup.  The taste is terrible at best. no amount of sugar and cream added makes it more tolerable. and quite honestly. there is a reason why Via sells better.  IT TASTES BETTER.  For several reasons I might add.  You can get it in a variety of flavors. so finding one you truly enjoy isn't difficult at all (unlike Taster's Choice).<br />Starbuck's spent an incredible amount of time and effort perfecting the instant coffee while Nestle appears to have pulled theirs outta their lower back.<br /><br />Long story short....if you like coffee. don't even try to settle for this.<br /><br />If. however. you have no love for coffee. and are solely interested in a bit of caffeine. I guess this would suffice. but honestly there are less disgusting ways to get it (apples for example).
26248,B0007A0PX0,A239D6FZHF13QE,ABC MOM,1/1,1276560000,Very convenient!,This is not an instant tea mix.  This actually powdered green tea leaves. Hence the cloudiness.  This product is convenient to mix into my water bottle that I take to the gym.  The finest green tea from an antioxidant perspective is Matcha green tea. It's the tea used in scientific studies that touts green tea's antioxidant properties.  It's very expensive but is grown in special areas in japan.<br /><br />I feel this is the next best thing.  It dissolves easily and I can take it with me and add to water on the go. I use match a when I'm at home. but this beats buying bottled green tea in quality and it's much more economical.
26252,B0007A0PX0,A23ZYHOZTVFWL0,S. Harless jes shoppin,0/1,1235779200,okay,not what I expected. but not bad. The taste is fine. just very cloudy in appearance. I was hoping to find a clear green tea....maybe it just isn't out there.
26254,B001O8KPAW,A5N1HB1T4EKCM,A. D. Hill,3/3,1274227200,Delicious sugar & chem-free fruit spread,I was eating Polaner All Fruit for years until they recently added maltodextrin to it (check the new labels.) I gave this a try as a true sugar-free. all fruit alternative that is also organic. which I purchased from my local health food store.<br /><br />The texture is thick and nice unlike some jellies which are watery. The flavor is good. There are many small seeds in this from the berries which I know some people may not like so I wanted to mention it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy alternative to sugar-laden jellies or those with synthetic sugar substitutes. I recommend this product.
26266,B000UCOQV2,ANCBYBPPR9VPA,J. Y. Warkentin jywillie,19/20,1192752000,Blackstrap Molasses,The molasses was all I expected. not too sweet and not too bitter.  The seller was reasonable about shipping and sent me some samples along with the molasses.
26271,B000UCOQV2,A3150C7E8XF6MM,poundcakes007,1/1,1346889600,love it,I have a difficult time finding blackstrap molasses here. so sent for it.  I love it in granola. hot water and I make the best gingerbread with it.  Full of B vitamins and with some ginger on top of a spoonful helps with a sore throat.
26272,B000UCOQV2,A1S5D9ODI7JEY2,debbie,1/1,1345852800,No problems,I was relecent to try this product. but happy I ordered it.  It arrived promptly and have begun to use it.  I can handle the taste it reminds me of black licorice.
26274,B0000XQQQO,A14RMK9JKP5RVW,Joy,0/0,1291680000,Simply delicious,I was served a sample of this flavor of coffee at an establishment.  I not only think the coffee makes the whole house smell great but the taste is simply delicious.  I'm now hooked on it.
26275,B004VDH4BU,A23TT78NE3WT08,hi,1/1,1326672000,I didn't like too much,I was not too impressed with this tuna.  It was ok.  I applaud the companies efforts and what they do.  I ended up giving 3 of my cans away.  I used the other 3 for  a meal.  I usually like tuna with oil. but I thought the flavor was lacking.  I think their other tuna canned in its own juices is much better.<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EY5TTW>Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Albacore Tuna. 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>
26282,B005UB3O7K,AHRNDSKWH1YBT,M. Hertzler,0/0,1337212800,Actually Pretty Decent!,I know that title sounds a big negative. but you have to know that I wasn't expecting much. Being only 1 WW Points+ each. I was expecting overly sweet. not very chocolatey and not very tasty. I was wrong. though!<br /><br />These are a decent size; one mouthful. or 2 smaller bites. Each is individually wrapped. which makes them perfect to stick in a lunch or snack box for work. They certainly stop my chocolate or sweet craving after meals or between 2-4 pm.
26292,B003CJJKL6,A1RKT6NASDVJID,Southern Indiana Girl.,1/1,1294617600,Amazing Coffee!,My husband and I were served this coffee at Derby Dinner Playhouse.  We asked the wait staff what brand they were serving and they said it was Douwe Egbert.  I had never heard of that brand. and couldn't find it in any of our local shops.  Thankfully for Amazon. we were able to find to purchase for home use.  This coffee is so good!  It's the smoothest coffee I have ever had. and the aroma is heavenly!!!!!!!  I store it in the fridge. and everytime I open the door. I can smell this fabulous coffee.  You won't be sorry on this one!  Try it!
26293,B003CJJKL6,A10TVUFIG2R64S,Deborah Finamore,0/0,1330992000,Douwe Egberts Select,Douwe Egberts coffee is the most incredible coffee you will ever have. but only out of the machine that uses the liquid form. I was so excited about availability of ground but very dissapointed in the taste. It's ok but nothing like the machine. It doesn't change my opinion of the company and the amazing machine. but I'll just stick with Starbucks. Peet's. Seattle's. etc ground. As always though. Amazon is so easy to work with. I received my order quickly. Amazon never let's me down.
26300,B0026MIT4O,ATJN4KEHJBOC8,KatyKatIL KatyKat,4/4,1325030400,Yummy bars!  Very happy with them.,I recently tried the Gnu Fiber bars in Banana and Walnut for the first time.<br />I have some dental troubles. so I am always concerned as to whether or not I<br />can even chew some of these fiber bars. Some are so hard. I can't bite them at all.<br />Others are expensive. and taste like cardboard.<br /><br />These bars are very tasty!  They are soft enough that they are enjoyable to eat.<br />There is one little seed in the bars that I have a hard time with - guessing it is<br />the millet. Other than that - they are easy for me to eat too.<br /><br />I didn't have troubles with them crumbling like another reviewer said. Mine were<br />very fresh and tasty.<br /><br />I am going to be buying these from here on out. and plan on trying some other flavors<br />as well.  I wish the cost was a little better. but watch for sales - they are out there<br />from time to time. If you like banana walnut flavored items. then you'll like this bar.<br />It tastes almost like a banana walnut muffin. Well worth trying.
26311,B000121BY6,A1G6SI9QVF8CRQ,Jason Morris jnmorris,9/9,1218672000,Great Item. but not the place to buy it...go to TRADER JOE'S,Orangina is my favorite drink of all time. and i average at least a bottle a day. but $11.05 is an outrageous price for four glass bottle. If you go to any Trader Joe's they sell the same four pack for $3.98
26316,B000121BY6,A19QMU7BA51GN,cmwhale,1/1,1305417600,Orangina delicious sparkling orange drink,I have not had this drink in years.  The first time I had it was in Connecticut at an Au Bon Pain restaurant.  I was recently in the Virginia Highlands area in Atlanta in a very cool coffee. wine grocery store and they had it.  My daughter loved it so I began to search online for it since they don't sell it in my area.  It is so fresh and delicious.  Wish it was easier to get.  Great service with this order. however shipping amount very high.
26327,B000F0BXC4,AZ8XMXF7MSJPB,Sewinglady5,2/2,1235692800,GREAT PRODUCT,DE BOLES MAKES THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PRODUCTS.  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS STYLE AND OTHER VARITIES FOR YEARS.  SO GLAD TO GET THEM ON AMAZON AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.
26329,B000F0BXC4,AAETDLL0KHIJ8,Jean J,0/0,1332979200,Delicious,We love pasta and it was my daughter in law who introduced me to this product. as I love pasta.  This is not heavy. like most pasta.  It is similar to angel hair pasta but more delicate and much more palatable and flavorful.  Perfect for pesto. light marinara or lightly buttered with shrimp (your favorite chicken or fish) vegetables and yet more healthy and satisfying.  It costs a bit more. but well worth it. for those who want to eat more light yet hearty.  My family love it!
26335,B0007ZNW1W,A2ZPKV563FR4NS,Kim S. Pierman love soft hands,1/1,1136160000,Jamaican all the way!,Since my first trip to Jamaica. I fell in love with the coffee.  The delivery date was right on and we had Blue Mountain coffee on Christmas morning!  For a treat. try drinking it with sweetened condensed milk!
26361,B005HGOIQ4,A2HYHT45PHNIIG,Aramat Aramat,3/3,1327795200,A Qualified 5,Just want to note my initial impressions.  I usually use sugar at home only for beverages and cereal.  I was running low on the 'raw sugar' I bought a few months back. and was looking for some more. when I ran into this.  For the price. it was worth a try.<br /><br />When I opened the package and caught the first sniff of the product. the first thought that came into my head was 'grape nuts'.  Odd. but that's what it made me think of.  The flavor is acceptable. no coconut that I could discern.  I agree that it doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular sugar.  It dissolves well in my coffee. but I haven't tried it on cereal yet.  I like the fact that it provides some nutritional value as well as sweetness.<br /><br />So. my 5 rating is qualified only by the fact that it is less sweet than I am used to.  I'm going to try using the same amount as I would if I were using 'regular' sugar and see if it's something I can get used to.  I could stand to become a little less dependent on sweetness.
26364,B005HGOIQ4,AO1CJIEIX3GN5,AnLe,1/1,1349308800,Just a bit healthier and it's low glycemic,Every recipe in which the blond or brown coconut crystals have been substituted for granulated cane sugar has turned out very well.
26365,B005HGOIQ4,A3GRGJ4COU5ABW,Wendy,1/1,1348963200,Coconut palm sugar great alternative,I purchased this after watching a Dr. Oz show. I'm looking for the sugar substitute that doesn't have side effects. This takes a little getting use to because it has a different taste. You measure it just like sugar and it is very nice in whole wheat chocolate chip cookies and works just like sugar. I is a pale brown and acts like brown sugar and tastes a little like it also.<br /><br />I am glad to have this safe choice. Is not suppose to spike your blood sugar and I think that is worth adjusting to it's taste.  Amazon has the very best offers for this product of all the places I looked.
26374,B005HGOIQ4,A2DHD047ZPD07M,funtech,1/1,1331510400,Coconut sugar Madhava,It was only $3.99 for 16 oz. at the Natural Grocers.  It was the Madhava brand and it was for both the blonde and the dark.
26378,B005HGOIQ4,A2L00YZBDOOM8N,J. Fuller,0/0,1348531200,A real substitue,I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I use this as a sub for white sugar.  I like it so much that I now have it regularly shipped to me.  Try it. you'll like it.
26392,B005HGOIQ4,AXE3GZ1JS3V4D,S K Hoppe Mind Embrace,1/6,1325721600,Not as sweet as cane sugar or agave. and the color....,Well. I like to make my own simple syrups to add to beverages. and this syrup turns out a caramel color. just a bit darker than the granules themselves.  It ends up giving the beverages a funky color....<br /><br />As I said before. the Madhava Organic Coconut Sugar is not as sweet in my mouth. and I do end up using more to keep a similar taste. increasing the caloric impact.  That. coupled with the color in my items. I may not purchase it again until I decide to cut my sugar uptake.  I don't now how it will taste with the recipes on the site as I generally do not bake. but with the simple syrup the color is so pronounced. ;-(<br /><br />I got this off the Gold Box deal and it was a great price. so that is not a disappointment.
26413,B001JYVT60,A37BNU9KEYV2UC,Stacey,3/4,1298332800,My dogs do not like the flavor,Regular flavor Budda Bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these.
26431,B003IYGF3Q,A1DKU5675AEQU9,Julie Lundgren,2/2,1295654400,So-so...needs to be in a glass container.,I used this syrup to mix in a Samoan Fog Cutter and the taste of plastic is SO overwhelming. I can't taste the orgeat! Don't really recommend this brand solely for the packaging; needs to be contained in glass to preserve the delicate taste. Would have been better otherwise.
26434,B000EF3E72,A2XW2CYV609CU0,SMSgt AF (ret),4/4,1209686400,Yummy!,I've enjoyed other Crown Prince products so I took a chance and tried this.  The first bite said unique taste. by about the 5th bite (quickly acquired taste) it was already a favorite.  This has a unique flavor which quickly grows on you AND can be eaten by itself directly from the can (no preparation required). I've already gone through most of the case in less than a week.  Wishing that I had ordered more of this one on the Crown Prince special.
26445,B000E5ILGQ,A2TG0HJTFZ7CXW,Katie Clark,5/6,1203465600,Tasty. easily supplemented and low Weight Watchers points,4 points/box (packet).  This Tasty Bite has a more gentle flavor than most. but it is still very flavorful.<br /><br />It's good and more soup-like straight out of the box. I often bring it in for lunch at work.  For dinner. I supplement with fresh spinach. chick peas and sometimes chicken sausage before I heat and eat!  A very satisfying dinner when supplemented. and even with spinach and 1/2c chick peas. only 5 points!<br /><br />I love this tasty bite because it is low-fat. low-cal. and extremely high flavor!  Doesn't taste like diet food. and it isn't.  It's just wholesome and good for you!
26455,B000E5ILGQ,A23ZRFLO4FCVXE,Diane Houslanger JapaRider,0/0,1287187200,Very Good!,This tastes like classic 'restaurant' dal and has great flavor. Dal is often a little soupy and not too thick like westerners might be used to when making lentils. If you want to add dal to your meal that tastes like the old fashioned Indian restaurant dal. this is the one.
26457,B000E5ILGQ,A3EIE5PV2HTK1D,DesiInCT,2/5,1178409600,Nice and simple. basic tadka daal!,Nice and simple. basic tadka daal! You cant go wrong with it.
26477,B003KV7V1C,A1KKT9S1DU8TCU,Julia Valinski,0/1,1336348800,It's Ok,The others like it a lot and I think the taste is good. but the texture is just off to me. Its very soft and tender. but kind of crumbly. I prefer the honey pepper. Not too spicy. either. so that's nice. Over all its ok and the others in the office will buy more. but I will stick to the other kinds.
26486,B0000TLEEW,AFP37DX81RWV1,MikeY,1/1,1317081600,Brings back memories,My mom is 82 years old and she has been telling me stories about how her father used to make huckleberry pies and how great they were. I wanted to give her a treat. so I Googled. Huckleberry. and found the company selling on Amazon. I called out to the store itself and spoke with a very friendly young lady named Krista. I wound up ordering their pie filling.<br />I first surprised my mom with the jam and she loved it!  Then I baked the pie and she said it was like her father's. I think she was being kind because the crust wasnt very good.<br />I would definitely recommend this product.
26509,B001IZBORY,A1ZZE36S8NT3TE,JOHN GURGEL,0/0,1342569600,The best pasta ever!,I can't believe I have been eating store bought pasta all these years. I just didn't know any better.  The first time I tasted La Campofilone pappardelle. I was hooked. The taste and texture of this pasta is beyond compare. I have not bought store pasta since and will never buy from a grocery store again.<br />THE BEST PASTA EVER!
26542,B000YSS7EO,AY263NVH71VB6,nick,0/0,1317600000,bad smell,Bought a can yesterday from a local store. The expiration was 2013. but it really smelled bad! What am I supposed to do now? Open every single can and do a smell test before buying?
26574,B000YSS7EO,A2FZMNZHEE0QG3,L. Murphy Goretsky,0/0,1265155200,Mixes well. versatile and not glue-like~,I am very happy with this cereal. I am confident feeding it to my infant because it's organic and it has probiotics. My son needed to be on a powder probiotic supplement that was VERY expensive. It's nice to make the transition and have it included in his food at this price point.<br /><br />When I first tried the cereal. I made a small amount (1 tsp cereal and 4 tsp breast milk) and made it runny (easy to do. as there is nothing glue-like about this cereal). He wasn't too fond of the experience - but that's not a reflection on this product at all. He's 5 months old now so I mix 1 tablespoon of the powder with 1 oz of breast milk and drop in one cube of frozen veggies (I make my own food and freeze it in ice cube trays). I heat it all up. mix it well and he's in HEAVEN! He prefers carrots & cereal. and butternut squash & cereal... and his favorite is bananas & rice cereal. I've tasted them all and while it's more bland than I had imagined. it's tasty. It's not sweet. just like a mellow oatmeal. This cereal also retains it's consistency throughout the feeding and also holds onto its warmth - which is great for a son like mine who will only eat warm/hot food!<br /><br />Also. there's been no constipation/diarrhea side effects like most first foods will have on your baby - a welcomed relief!
26579,B000YSS7EO,A3TR9U0DCYJVKZ,Brad Listermann BradList,0/0,1255996800,Super MUST HAVE product for your baby!,Our daughter is now 1 yrs old and loves this!  We mix it into everything she eats so that she gets the added DHA and vitamins since she is now off from formula.  I highly recommend this to any parent.  The quality is super and the results are a very healthy baby!
26595,B000YSS7EO,A3PHRROE9EDT5Y,mom of twins,0/0,1227571200,What a great idea!,Probiotics and cereal in one - a great idea!!! My twins love this cereal and so do I!
26599,B000YSS7EO,ADSBNR0OJ6U38,D. Braidman maxsmama,0/0,1212364800,baby loves it!,this was recommended to me by my girlfriend and my baby boy loves it!  we skipped the rice cereal and went right to oatmeal when it was time for solids.  great product!
26601,B000YSS7EO,A4EDOT5FWLKHW,nymom,1/2,1290297600,problems with recent batch,My first can of Happybellies oatmeal was cream-colored and odorless. my second can was greenish-brown and smelled rancid (I immediately threw it out). and the third can was also greenish-brown in color but smelled a little less rancid.  Serious quality issues considering the high price and brand image.  I don't recommend this oatmeal until they acknowledge and resolve this issue.
26612,B000YSS7EO,A3ISCAEU5GLN2Z,kiki,1/4,1329955200,contains arsenic,All rice cereal contains arsenic which may cause cancer.  Check with your pedeatrician and see if you can switch to oatmeal instead which this brand carries as well. You can google rice cereal and arsenic for more information.  I will not be feeding my baby any rice after reading about arsenic.
26623,B000YSS7EO,A1SLUSBK9ZEAL2,Chicago Mom,19/26,1212278400,Overpriced. incorrect portions,I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less. which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices - and I purchased in bulk on Amazon so the per unit price definitely should have been better.  Also. infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid. which is what it says on this container. but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal. which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal. though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand.
26630,B000YSS7EO,A1RMYR560JBOC6,dn Dave dn Dave,2/2,1316044800,Weird smell and taste!,Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can. it smells like green apple candy.  However. the taste does not have any apple flavor. or even grain-flavor like the other cereals but a little weird/chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.<br /><br />Back to Gerber & EB for my son...
26656,B000YSS7EO,A12SX2HUT1OAGS,Y. Cai kongfu_panda,1/1,1290729600,a strange smell,Before you purchased the product. make sure you know that this cereal has a very strange smell. This is the normal smell of the product. I don't know how to describe the smell. but be careful with your choice.<br />My baby doesn't like the smell.
26663,B000YSS7EO,A2NLQ41ZUQZ05Z,A. Sawatzky,1/1,1267747200,Good product. poor quanitity.,I love the product. but I think that it is a bit too pricey. The cans are barely over half full so we go through them very quickly. Like I said. I love the actual cereal. but if it wasn't the only cereal my baby could eat I wouldn't buy it because of the price.
26665,B000YSS7EO,A3M5WRY80SPFK1,SVR,1/1,1250985600,my baby loves this! :),I've been giving my little one the rice cereal since she was 4 months old- she loves this and she has not had any allergies or anything- she loves it so much- every meal time is full of smiles. gurgles and cute messes!
26675,B000YSS7EO,ADLSGYBOJK1P9,P. D. Stanley,1/1,1201132800,Happy Bellies Oatmeal,We were so happy to find the Happy Bellies Oatmeal and our granddaughter just loved it!  What a GREAT product -- I've told all my grandma friends!
26690,B000YSS7EO,A2QCXBNDWUWS18,Full-Time Mom of 4,0/0,1350691200,Great Product!,My youngest has a wheat-free. egg-free. dairy-free. peanut-free diet.  I'm glad I found this rice cereal that met all of these needs but also provided nutrition. It is cheaper to purchase it at Amazon then to purchase it from my local health store.
26702,B0078UZH6W,A3CFM008T8ZZG5,Terry D. Janes TheVikingsWorld.com,0/0,1350172800,Without Question. The Best Honey I Ever Tasted!,I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey. and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead brewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this. I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark. rich honey without the hay taste of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all. having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff. and kept going back for more.  I have my mead brewing (6 1/2 gallons). and the brewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead. which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!
26710,B000XQ6RLM,A1VSBEJHLPTN7H,Vesta Vesta,1/1,1325980800,My Dogs like it,My dogs eat a mostly vegetarian/vegan diet.  They seem to enjoy this food.  They've never turned their noses up at it ... and. BTW. they are not the kind of dogs who will eat anything.  If they didn't like it. they would leave it.<br />Since they've stopped eating the meat byproducts. they have stopped having upset stomachs and diarrhea. I am certain this is because they are no longer consuming the veritable slaughter house slop/floor waste - all of the garbage that is too toxic/inedible for human consumption is made into dog and cat food.  Not only slaughterhouse waste. but also sometimes animals who have been euthanized at shelters are rendered into pet food.  I wish I could safely feed my cats a vegetarian diet. but as they are obligate carnivores. I cannot.  So. I shall continue to do the best I can and will do so by continuing to feed my dogs AvoDerm Natural Vegetarian Formula.

THEY WILL EAT A FEW HERE AND THERE WHEN THEY GET HUNGRY ENOUGH BUT OTHERWISE PASS IN HOPES OF GETTING THEIR CHEWY TREATS INSTEAD.  BUT DON'T LET MY DOGS' TASTE AND PREFERENCES INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION.  THEIR INGREDIENTS ARE HEALTHY AND THE AMOUNT YOU GET FOR THE PRICE IS UNBELIEVABLE.  CRUNCHY IS ALWAYS BETTER FOR THE HEALTH OF THE TEETH. TOO.  THE GINGERBREAD SHAPE IS CUTE AND A GOOD SIZE.  DOESN'T HURT TO TRY...I DID CONSIDERING THEIR INGREDIENTS AND PHENOMENAL PRICE.
26743,B00750YCJ8,A3BRQ3L755ZJU0,Zarah,1/1,1345420800,This is a reluctant review,I really did not want to review this marmalade because it is soo good and soo hard to find. When Amazon finally had it I bought all available jars of it (nine)so I should be set for a while. it has a spectacular taste. hard to describe but to be compared with the affect canary diamonds have on people. we just do not want to live without them anymore.<br /><br />Just in case y'all buy up the entire production of this divine marmalade. I planted a Yuzu tree which should withstand our North Georgia climate just fine and provide me with plenty of fruit to survive the times when y'all act as greedy as I did and buy up everything that is available.<br /><br />This marmalade is not only good on toasted English muffins. it makes chicken salad sparkle end makes some creamy cheeses become memorable.
26746,B001FXLLEK,A1Q9OCHQ5LL6XF,noclaimtofame,1/1,1285113600,very tasty,This cereal product is delicious and is a nice change from so many gluten-free cereals that have a cinnamon flavor. I really liked the fact that it is a high-protein cereal. which helps to control blood sugar levels.

She won't take the medicine any other way - not even in Pill Pockets. The only draw back. we can't find them anymore except online. We first purchased them at Sam's Club but they no longer carry them and neither does Pet Smart or Pet Co. Thank goodness for Amazon!

They are also terrific for when you are away from home. Just 30 seconds in the microwave and they're done. Very easy and convenient!
26874,B005M1EKHQ,A3KKHE0I11SCV2,Eric Stevens,0/0,1350172800,Watch out for online deals!,Big Mistake. I ordered two cases of these Crown Prince Sardines when my local store stopped stocking my usual brand (King Oscar) which were on back order. Not at all to my liking and I have been eating sardines for a couple of years. I even believe a few cans are either spoiled or off? Hard to prove but somehow I taste it?? Haha- and I ordered 2 cases. suppose I could return them-but then I have to pay shipping back- ate them at first-out of stubborness- but then just gave up hoping maybe I just hit a bad can or two. Lesson learned- don't jump too deeply into that online case deal- try an individual one first unless you have alot of experience with the products at hand. I will stick to Nordiac/Brisling sardines for now on- have never had a bad can or off taste with these in water or olive oil.

It must really be fresh because it smells a lot more 'pepperminty' than what you buy in the stores. Mom.  He's right - it does! It's also great cold as iced tea - my grandchildren love it. A friend & myself enjoy getting together for hot tea and quiet conversation - this tea is one of our favorites.<br />I have purchased this tea thru Amazon's subscribe & save.  I save on the cost of the tea by purchasing it this way; t arrives right on schedule; and with the subscription option. it's delivered right to my front door. I love the convenience of being able to change the amount when I want more boxes or changing the delivery date when I'm going to be away and won't need it that month.

26910,B0002ML8D4,AVJPULZCW2IOE,J. Payer,0/0,1231027200,This food was too good - dog went on a diet!,Our Yorkie was on Canidae since the day she came home from the rescue. but recently Canidae switched their formula and the new formula did not agree with her.  The Solid Gold Wee Bit came highly recommended from several trusted sources. so we switched.<br /><br />Because the new formula of Canidae wasn't working for her. we switched her cold turkey to the Solid Gold.  Normally I like to switch gradually. mixing in a larger percentage of the new food with the old each day until they are completely switched over.  This normally prevents upset stomach and loose stools but we were unfortunately already there.  :-(<br /><br />Our Yorkie took to the new food immediately. and the loose stools stopped within one day.

Her coat looks great and her energy level is high.  5 stars!
26942,B000H2405M,A1B1L9MFOZEYLG,S. Prescott domestic zookeeper,2/2,1207180800,Very Tasty Chili!!!,This is sooo tasty and very low in calories.  So many low cal foods don't have much flavor but this one has both.  I made a couple of changes - because I love the flavor of tomatoes I decreased the water from 7 cups to 6 cups and added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes to the water.  I also added a can of black beans (drained)to it.  I was trying to keep the calories down so didn't add meat but imagine that would be good also.  Try it....
26956,B000H2405M,AR38UO36XB7MR,Larry D. LaForce Techno Junkie,0/0,1298851200,Darn good? Naw. it's HELLA good!!!,Easy to make. and made as directed is tame enough for even the biggest wussy in your life. For the more daring. it makes a great base to experiment on top of. The simmering time on it is not long. and maybe it's just me. but seems to get better the longer it's simmered. I usually go for 3 hours.<br /><br />I've officially stopped buying canned chili since stumbling across this at the store! I would recommend this to any chili fan for when you're to lazy to do it from scratch. Seems pricey here on Amazon though since i've bought mine for $4 a pack average at most stores such as Wal-Mart & WinCo.
26962,B000H2405M,A15VVDB1XC6S0E,Patricia L. Heflin Recipe Book Lover,0/0,1269648000,Fantastic!,I don't know what possessed me to try this but am sure glad I did.  I made it per directions. just adding water and a can of tomato paste.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't tell my SO there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome.  Couldn't believe the very low calories and high fiber.  A definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry!
26976,B001B38CI2,A2UJAMHF6QYGBX,D. D. Gowdy ddgowdy,1/1,1252713600,The only wet brand my dog will eat,I have tried other brands even from the same maker and my dog will only eat the Purina One. I ended up giving the other food away. now just wish they had the Weigh formula in the case.
26979,B001W85UQS,A5FUQPMLMX7KC,E. Gibbons Dance Prof,2/2,1300060800,The Best,This is now my favorite herb tea--full-bodied and extraordinarily flavorful. it doesn't have the weakly flavored hot water taste of many herbal teas. I keep trying to find another plum tea that I can get locally but to no avail; they are all just pale by comparison. I'll have to keep ordering it online!
26981,B005FPDEN0,AE508CW7ON3EP,armommi,2/2,1347753600,Great Stuff!,This is an awesome product. For those who can't digest cows milk. this is an awesome replacement. It has all the nutrients you need and is low in calories and the taste is superb. I use it in baking and cooking with the added flavors of vanilla and coconut. it's a real treat. Really adds flavor to protein drinks. too.  The aseptic packs are great for camping and taking on the road if you have no refrigeration available.
26988,B003ULJJN0,A23UJF80AF81FK,Mary W. Baker,3/3,1313712000,fragrant and lovely,I purchased this as a gift for my boss. who is an herbal tea fanatic.  First of all. the aroma when he makes this tea in the office is amazing and makes my mouth water.  Secondly. it's just a great-tasting tea.  Highly recommend.
27008,B003SC0QBK,A29F6WGQXZU5QT,ntqueen,0/0,1308009600,love the stuff,I've been buying it for the past 2 years at the 'mart' store.  Can't beat the taste for the price.  Drain off the oil and it take very little mayo to make a moist tuna salad.  I also like to use it right out of the can on a greek type salad with feta.
27021,B001EO5UT2,AR240SU6LYNIZ,Sherrie Pitchford sherrie,0/0,1324857600,not the item just want to warn of the sellers,These sellers do not want to give me my money back i purchased this item and it said pack of 4 accross the top of the box with an arrow and in the description. The cakes are great but i ended up spending a total about 40 dollars for this thing. I a purchased them for about 4 dollars at big lots a few years ago. I'm working on getting my money back but i suggest you be aware of what you are ordering. It isn't a pack of 4 it only 1.
27048,B00024D628,A23FS2LPU099QY,Naturade Man,4/6,1136419200,It has changed my life forever!,Who would have ever thought a single. yummy. chocolately drink could make me feel like a whole new man! I am never hungry and I am saving so much money not visiting fast food places daily. Thank You Naturade for showing me the path to true health and weight loss salvation.
27061,B005FPDENK,A3N5TG9V3YM37I,leafyliz,0/0,1344038400,best of both worlds,All the subtlety of coconut milk with the richness of almond milk. It has a much more neutral taste than plain almond milk. which I love. If it were organic it would be even better.
27071,B003ZNXCE0,A2OXFVELYBRQ1X,styx,0/0,1348185600,A Glitch in the system?,I ordered what I thought was five 4 packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five single packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.
27072,B003ZNXCE0,AS5VIFYZBZTSA,3chis&amp;adobe,0/0,1346716800,My dogs love these!,I got these for my chihuahuas and all three of them love them! They seem to be easier to chew than rawhide. and I'm not as afraid of them choking! I wish they had more flavors- but I'm sure they will in time!
27078,B003ZNXCE0,A1VOYZC0FJ9VO9,Wanda J. Bermudez,1/2,1308614400,Great Doggie Treat!,SmartBones. Mini (Chicken flavor) is a great alternative to rawhide bones. I recommend this product for all dogs. My dog JJ loves this treat!
27096,B000EM8U1U,A2G8H82RM1K1P0,Kather2ny,0/0,1319932800,My Favorite Chai Tea,This is my favorite tea! I love the balance of spices - not too much of anything. not too strong. just nice flavor. Other brands of chai tea seem to be too strong. too bitter. or too much of one spice or another. Lipton Spiced Chai is just right; a nice flavor change from standard tea. Earl Grey. English Breakfast or fruit teas. I've just subscribed to this tea because I have been having a hard time finding it any more. and I drink several cups a day year round. I've tried most of the other brands. but don't like any of them nearly as well. I hope Lipton continues to make this tea!
27104,B000EM8U1U,A1BKJNAWJT2TG2,G. Scott Gia Scott,0/0,1300838400,Good chai without any medicinal taste,This is a good spiced chai tea.  Not the best. but far from the worst.  It's one that I always keep on hand. and I love ordering it from Amazon because of the great price.  It's inexpensive enough that I don't mind using it for an iced tea too.  My favorite way to make it is with some sugar & hot water. then stir in a couple of spoonfuls of Nestle's Nido instant whole milk--delicious!  (I like the instant milk better than real fresh milk even.)  My other half usually prefers his minus the milk through some strange prejudice that milk or cream are not to be mixed with tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend Lipton's Spiced Chai--there is NO medicinal taste like some other brands. and the spices aren't as strong as my favorite brand (Bigelow). so its something that those who aren't as fond of spiced chai can enjoy.
27116,B000EM8U1U,A1RBS4BNWAZMDB,Michael K. See MrPresident,0/0,1170720000,Great product. wish there was more flavor in it,I bought these on a super discount from Amazon - got like 360 teabags for about $22 or something like that - which made it a no-brainer.<br /><br />Pros: great taste. steeps to full flavor in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Cons: not extremely strong.  If you like strong tea you likly need to use 2 teabags in a standard size cup (16 oz or so) in order to really enjoy the taste.

This particular product is at the top of my list of favorites. It is so good. I order it by the case from Amazon.com. Still. if you like your chili hot (I don't). then skip this one. It does have all the other flavors. however. which appeal to my taste -- and to friends with whom I have shared this too guarded secret. C'mon Stagg. turn your advertising department loose! It's hard to find this product in my local markets.

I found the Purina Friskies Indoor Adventures Crunchy but it seems there are other cats out there who demand their owners buy these treats.  I love that I can order this product on a subscription shipping schedule which means I will never run out of their favorite treat.

27219,B0000TL6CC,A284GFJ79HQPRL,David Kim,0/1,1302566400,paste in a plastic tube,This is basically seasoned paste in plastic tube.  It does not cook well on it's own and is only good as an extra flavoring.  The taste seemed a bit weird to me.  It tasted like plastic.  Gross!!<br /><br />Save your money and just get some good quality spices to add to your meal.
27231,B0033HGLTG,AMNNIWOZAH59I,Ed Nailor,2/2,1318636800,Good evening coffee with bold taste,I generally drink this in the late evening as it is decaf. The taste is nice and enjoyable. Not as dark and bold as I normally prefer. but does a good job for an evening decaf coffee.

Leite gafieiraman,0/0,1263772800,Good ginger. but not the pure. strong Ginger I was looking for,This is just for my taste. it may be perfect for you since it is not as strong as pure ginger itself.<br /><br />If you think pure ginger is too strong. then go for this product. otherwise this is too light.
27366,B000GG5IZA,A1ACBKFP53DSCW,L. Mower,1/2,1295568000,Disappointed,Seeing the word tangy on the front of the box. I had high hopes of a refreshingly tart. vibrant raspberry herbal tea.  Instead I found it less like tea and more like a weakly flavored cup of liquid raspberry J-ello!  Leaving the bag in longer doesn't help either.  The first cup I made. I got distracted and the bag was left to steep 30 minutes before I took a sip.  I'll be switching back to Tazo Passion as soon as I finish the box.
27379,B0040BESXK,A2EKJ6N0CY3ZX0,J. S. Nash,0/0,1344124800,Another great product from Whole Earth,My dogs have been loving the Whole Earth canned food by Merrick. so I decided to try the dry and we all love this one. too!
27388,B007H13SYA,A13TK5XFMWR1TC,Linda K. Hirte,0/0,1348790400,Try for something better,The cheese pack with the popcorn is mostly salt.  Put it on the popcorn and you have salty popcorn.  It's orange but it doesn't taste anything like cheese.  Without the packet it is very bland. dull and only looks like popcorn.  Best to skip this and look for something better.
27409,B004PE9UVC,A2UHDC378SBCSS,BooksRme,0/0,1325548800,Great Tasting Tea!,The tea tastes great. I can no longer find it in my local store. I believe it to be decaf because I drink it at night and it doesn't keep me up. Who cares what it says on the package. The price keeps fluctuating. I just wish it would settle down to about 3.00 a box instead of 4. You will enjoy it.
27414,B003NY7K8A,A23UKBPWKEI7ZG,sherry,0/0,1342310400,This product it not what you may think you are getting,I enjoyed my Manicardi 8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as 12. I was able compare them side by side and this 12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally 12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually grape must and a condiment quality. But including the 12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better.
27425,B00473QVS6,A32Y0FP67C9WF9,KimM,0/0,1348617600,Moldy,All five packages were too small. too old. and all were full of mold!  Will not buy this brand again.

DILOSSI Love a bargain with quality,0/0,1288828800,Almost as good as mine,I am an East coast transplant living in Indianapolis and have a hard time finding quality pasta sauces.  After trying almost all that was offered here. I decided to try this. and am so glad I did.  It is so good. almost as good as mine. but I don't have the time to cook sauce all day.  I add a few ingrediants like Romano cheese and spices. but you don't have to add anything to it.<br />I have a feeling that my store will not be carrying this too much longer as I am the only one buying it. so I am glad to see that Amazon has it for me.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!  You scored a big one with this product.
27458,B004LC6KV6,A3VKYU4WYBNBGP,Lana J. Swanson,4/5,1305072000,Good for on the go,My only wish is that this can could be bigger...it says that it makes up to 24 quarts but I like to use 1 1/2 cups to make it a little bit stronger using a Gatorade water bottle I bought from Amazon too. I've tried using my CamelBak water bottle with a bite valve. but if it isn't washed out right away it will start to mold up a little on the inside of the bite valve like if I try to use it for night time drinking.
27465,B0025GD3XI,A1IBFLIPSI0QQ1,opierod6000,1/1,1314835200,Just the right amount of heat.,Lovely little hot sauce.  I gave it 4 Stars vs 5 because I was expecting some serious heat.  That said the flavor is really nice and the low heat to flavor ratio makes this a very versitle hot sauce to be used on everything.  Enjoy!
27487,B000ND0CMK,A1F2VXU6N83EUC,Llda Schellhase,6/6,1281571200,Great size,Was really surprised at the size of the plant and would order from this company again.  Packed very well along with two others I ordered.
27496,B0015MYO04,A2OL0SADJOFH8T,Deborah,1/1,1243036800,Best Pecans Ever,These are great! Large pieces. no little crumbles or shells. I have never found pecans this good at this price. The reclosable foil pouch lets me keep them in the freezer. so I have pecans ready at all times without them going stale or rancid.

Unfortunately I live in a small town and can't always find it.My mom used to mail them to me a couple of times a year.but she has recently passed away.But thanks to Amazon .I can still get my fix delivered to my door in a timely manner. If you like authentic tasting coffee with an awesome aroma...Bustello is for you! one cup in the morning gets me ready for the day.

27522,B002ED91KQ,A3GA722AIR22HR,diannebug,5/5,1295654400,Better than Imagined,I have used this product in the past. I caught a MRSA infection from the hospital and after spending hundreds of dollars on prescription drugs to clear up the infection in my wound. I found that nothing worked. I did my research and felt that this was worth a shot. It quickly cleared up the infection and quickly healed my wound.<br />Fast forward 3 years and I have surgery to repair a broken leg. Unfortunately my incision opens and instead of spending hundreds of dollars on prescription treatment. I went ahead and ordered this product. After using it for a few days my incision has completely closed. If there was a ever a miracle product. this would be it.
27529,B002ED91KQ,A13MUNTZER9CRM,Bar Bar A Babs,1/2,1259020800,Good Stuff,This product worked well for my mother when she was in a nursing home due to MRSA sores. We used it in addition to the treatment she was receiving and think it made the wounds heal faster.  My doctor sells this in his natural pharmacy so I keep it on hand for general wound care.
27556,B000FPWJJA,A1YWTE62TPCBR2,David Sternlight,0/0,1331683200,Heavy garlic,Although highly rated by experts. too much garlic smell for my taste. Going back to Shark brand after 4 bottles of this.<br />Notes:<br />1. Smaller bottle than most; may be convenient at table.<br />2. Like some other good imported brands. no chemical preservatives. US Huy Fong has chemicals. probably because it' s left out all day on restaurant tables.<br />3. Top is weak--hinge broke off before fully used.<br />4. After 3 top very hard to put back on.
27559,B000FDDFUE,AV624G630GQB,Stumpjumper,5/5,1178323200,Good stuff,As with all the Ryvita Crispbread's I've tried. these are very filling. taste great and you can eat them with absolutely no guilt.  At 35 calories per crispbread and no fat or sugar. you can eat three and be completely satisfied without having blown your diet.  I eat them with some fruit as an afternoon snack.  They perfectly balance the sugar hit you get from the fruit and keep you going for hours.
27562,B000FDDFUE,A1ZXF1M6IZEBS1,C. V. Bessette Mother of two,1/1,1247011200,Light & Crispy,My whole family enjoys these crackers which for me as a concerned Mother with all the falsely advertised products titled All Natural. There are only a few ingredients that make up these crackers and the nutrients found in those will amaze you!
27575,B000FK52B2,A25NE4ZT5J6SKE,Unnamed,24/26,1163203200,Very easy,I have the larger version of this item. and am now buying this one.  I like it. but the larger version is just too big for my crowded refrigerator.  I've had other sprouters in the past. and this one is as good or better than any I've tried.  (Skip quinona (sp?) seeds. however.  They were my one disaster).
27576,B000FK52B2,A32EHNK1TVFA8L,Karen Davison,14/14,1235692800,Sprout Master,The biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems  to be much easier with a jar and screens. However. the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time.
27578,B000FK52B2,A3DC6DQMHI3Y3,A. Mayr,8/8,1252800000,Exactly what I needed,As described. small. space saving. yet highly practical. Worked well so far with lentils and with small broccoli seeds. Will get good use out of this!
27583,B000FK52B2,A2ILQMYFPP7918,G3 fan,3/3,1286496000,The best sprouter for leafy sprouts,I have used this sprouter for going on ten years.  It makes great sprouts always. and you can store the sprouts right in the sprouter.  Be sure to clean it periodically. otherwise sprout quality will suffer.  It probably works well for bigger seeds to sprout as well. but I uses it exclusively for leafy/small seed types. like alfalfa. clover. radish. and other similar blends.
27588,B000FK52B2,AM6GZVDKWPHZ9,micah,0/0,1340928000,Cheap and Easy way to get into sprouts,I bought these shortly after having bought the larger sproutmaster tray. As I mostly only sprout for myself. the smaller trays made a lot more sense. I try to stagger my sprouts now so I always have fresh sprouts on hand. These are incredibly easy to use and clean. although I recommend having some sort of brush for cleaning (smaller seeds/sprouts tend to get stuck in the holes). I highly doubt the expensive automatic sprouting trays could be any easier to use than these. I spend MAYBE 1 - 2 mins rinsing my sprouts a day--and thats it.
27597,B000PWTXE2,A393W9IH4QK3LM,Cain,1/1,1229299200,Excellent,The Gold Kili Ginger Drink is an excellent drink. especially for those who like ginger and a refreshing non-caffeinated drink.  It arrived at a reasonable amount of time. even before I expected it to arrive.
27598,B000PWTXE2,A7JPFFQDZBROF,M. szczesny lailamar,2/3,1189468800,FOR COLDS. AND FLU... AND MUCH MORE,I have started to drink this drink and giner latte one too during the September seasons. and believe me i hardly had a cold or flu during the winter times. One time a Chinese friend told me if you drink this drink in fall you won't have to worry about the rest of cold months. She advised me to drink it for 2-3 wks straight. every day. than stop and drink only occassionally. I have followed her advice and yes. it worked for me. I use to buy these only in Asian Stores. but since Amazon have them now available I am stocking up and giving it to all my relatives for winter.

27617,B000K8ESBO,A1E9KW6YHVF0UW,Pamela N. Bishop Rev. Pam,1/1,1265155200,convenient,These are the most convenient coffee creamers I have ever found.  No more messy powder packets that could pop open and ruin my purse.  I loved these from the first day I saw them.  They are a blessing for traveling.  Now it doesn't matter what flavor coffee establishments have. I can make it be the flavor I want.
27627,B000BF54MS,AASKM93JZX6II,Carolin Campbell carriecc,3/3,1225670400,Delicious. mild and versatile,I am too wimpy for spicy foods. so often rely on this chili. It's not bland. though. don't get me wrong.<br /><br />I can serve this to non-vegetarian friends (though I'm honest with them about its soy meat substitute content) and they love it! A couple friends will add some Tabasco but otherwise nobody tinkers with it.<br /><br />I've used this as chili with sour cream. on tostadas. as part of a Sloppy Joe. and even as a dip for crackers.<br /><br />The sodium content is a bit high but I'll take the tradeoff. It makes a wonderfully comforting hot meal on a cold fall or winter evening.<br /><br />Kids like this chili too!<br /><br />I generally serve two to three people with each can.<br /><br />It's also good with cornbread.
27628,B000BF54MS,A1E3WY9OD7SV24,Deyna79,2/2,1252195200,Great deal.,I've been using Worthing products for most of my life and they are great. This is a very good deal.
27646,B000BF54MS,A3PSVI1D7LQ4GN,stinhoutx,3/6,1215475200,Waaay to salty to enjoy.,I tried really hard to like the product (it comes in a case of 12 after all) but I just could not take the taste. It looks like regular chili. has some fat like regular chili. has a texture like regular chili. and it almost tastes good. if you can get past the salt.<br /><br />This is the second. and last. of this brand and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better. IMHO. veggie chili can be made with some diced onions. tomatoes. green bell peppers. a hot chile of your choice. garlic. oregano. chili powder. a little masa. tomato paste. and one or more types of beans. like pintos. kidneys. mayo coba. etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done. or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.<br /><br />I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.<br /><br />Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me. so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried. vegetarian or not. this compared favorably. But. I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal breaker for me. as it is with other prepared. canned chilis.
27649,B003U0O0X0,A2E26NXH227J8C,Lorre Smith Red Blaze,7/8,1312934400,Don't be fooled,If you are looking for the Broadway rolls you knew as a kid. these look like them and have the same name but don't be fooled.  When I found them (and I have been looking for a long time) I was excited so I ordered a 24 ct box.  I sat on the edge of my seat until the package arrived a few minutes ago.  I brought it in. opened it right away and prepared for a walk down memory lane for my taste buds.  The first thing I noticed was that they lacked the nice red color and when I got the individual package opened they were stiff.  Not at all like before when they would come out of the package smelling wonderful and the sections would come apart easily and pliable.  Wish I could show a picture here so the difference between the item picture and what I got could be seen.  Perhaps the boxes that are being sold came from an old warehouse where they have been sitting for 25 years because that's what they look. feel and taste like. So Very Disappointed!  <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U0O0X0>Broadway Strawberry Licorice Rolls 24 Ct Box</a>

When I received this package. it was different and had a very distinctive smell.  I tasted some of one and had to throw the whole box away.  Careful when purchasing...
27674,B001EO69NS,A1L4RDILGM7D9E,Paula,28/31,1217376000,Delicious yogurt!,This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated. you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste. which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best.
27677,B001EO69NS,A1SHHQSPOWR00F,just another customer,9/9,1282003200,Infallable,I used two of the 5 gram pouches for a gallon of milk (one sleeve for a total of 10 grams).  I do not have a yogurt maker and used a stainless steel pot on the stove.  After the heating process. I put the cultured milk in my oven to incubate over about 8 hours (longer than suggested).  Periodically. I'd turn the oven on for a minute or so to get the mixture about 100 degrees F. but I bet the temperature fluxuated quite a bit.<br /><br />I then strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a few hours (while sitting at room temperature).  The yogurt is far tastier and smoother than Fage brand Greek-style yogurt.  It's about the consistency of very thick mayonaise or sour cream.  I doubt I will ever eat mayo or sour cream again.<br /><br />The starter is very forgiving.  Now that I have cultured yogurt. I'll probably use the mother instead of the starter.<br /><br />If you are interested in instructions or a recipe. although I did not follow this book exactly. it's a great reference:<br /><br /><a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931498237>Wild Fermentation: The Flavor.

27683,B001EO69NS,A2ALR22UJ6QI6R,F. Wang,2/2,1251504000,Always the Best,I have been making yogurt using the Yogourmet machine and this CBA starter since 2003.  It was very easy to make successful yogurt consistently so I never switched to any other products.  It is good for both non-fat and whole fat milk - although personally I prefer whole fat since it tastes original.  I use 1/2 to 2/3 of a small bag for each 1/2 gallon container of yogurt.  It always comes out right after 11 hours of cooking time. I will definitely recommend this product.
27687,B001EO69NS,A10M2GPAPXKBBN,Jane L. Ramirez Storywriter,1/1,1319414400,Yummy Yogurt,I have been using store bought yogurt to make my yogurt. However I have found that Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt is so much better than the store bought variety. The flavor is purely delightful. I like to eat it as soon as it is cooled off. My yogurt is now much thicker and tastier than it was with the store bought yogurt. There is another benefit. I have been trying to regulate my digestive system......have had a problem for years. I have taken probiotic supplements with absolutely no success. My system now is perfect.....thanks to the Probiotic Yogurt Starter.
27696,B001EO69NS,A2YP56D2Z4PLVS,Armando Diaz Salazar ADS67,0/0,1331424000,Excellent!,Great Product! Worth the price!  Only downside is the prep time. but if you leave it overnight it is no biggie!
27702,B001EO69NS,A2R3HWVYA3KTUM,Loves to Cook,0/0,1315267200,Homemade yogurt is worth the effort,My family prefers food made from scratch-breads. soups. jams. pickles. etc. The taste has more depth. better spices. texture & freshness. So. I thought I'd give making my own yogurt a try. I have used the Yogourmet  Starter with excellent results in a EuroCuisine maker. I use a combination of skim. 2% & powdered milks & a long overnight processing time  for a thicker. Greek style product.  All of us love the tang  & texture of the fresh yogurt. Since we started eating the homemade yogurt. we have noticed better digestion & less between meal hunger.too.
27754,B002RBTV78,A17CN7BFB8996W,enpointeagain,5/7,1272067200,These are to die for.,Product speaks for itself. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! They came well packaged. and quickly.the cost very competitive. who could ask for more?

Chocolate shell over creamy. dreamy smoothness! I love these things. One secret that I couldn't keep to myself; I had to send another box home to my parent. which they are currently enjoying...

27781,B002RBTV78,AAV27XT2YTJIU,Superman,0/0,1303603200,One of the best chocolates,These are simply one of the best chocolates I have ever had.  If you don't believe me. you should look at the way my my nephews and nieces act when I bring these for them.  Their eyes light up instantly. and the way they simply ignore everything else in the world when they are enjoying the chocolaty goodness. is a five star review in itself.<br /><br />Four stars. because it's pricey!  But that never stops me from buying more ;o)
27788,B001DST6IK,A3BMGQB84S31YT,Jen,2/2,1302825600,Perfect. green cutting board,I'm so glad I purchased this cutting board. I'm glad I was able to support something relatively local (U.S. made) and it's the perfect size for someone who cooks for 1-2 people. It doesn't take up too much space in my cabinet or on my counter when I'm cutting. Also. it's a good looking cutting board.
27816,B0075AOEJ6,A358CTE36IPE0R,brooklynniteowl,1/1,1323907200,My Mistake for Not Reading Very Thoroughly!,Actually. I thought I was going to get a jar of EACH of the three mustards.  Oops!  Received package today. was confused when I opened it to find only one jar of mustard. Back to Amazon to look at product. Ahhh ... they show a shot of three mustards. but you only get one jar!! So. my fault for not reading thoroughly -- but Amazon should really REALLY have an individual shot of each jar. and ditch the pic that shows three mustards. It is misleading. This jar of mustard is a stocking stuffer gift for my sweetie -- he loves Irish whiskey and mustard. so this seems like a win-win situation! $7.00 for it but that's about what I'd pay in hoity-toity gourmet market in Manhattan anyway. so no big deal. It was carefully packaged and I figure boyfriend will be delighted with it.
27839,B000SP1CWW,A102TGNH1D915Z,LINDA Riley,2/3,1262131200,Not just for puppies...,Although the product can be a bit pricey. it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6>KONG Stuff'N Snacks. Liver. 11-Ounce. Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8>KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy. Large. Red</a>) first. then anchor it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks. until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms. and will keep us up with pacing. barking. howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz.........

27885,B000FPH1NY,AQMNL7ZFOTTO7,S. Post,1/1,1327017600,Pooches Love Them,Good quality product. our two small pooches loved the peanut butter!  They're the perfect treat. not too messy and keep the dogs busy for a good amount of time (their ears pearch up when they hear Who wants a DINGO??).
27911,B005YVW0JE,ADJDGIRNBYSDZ,Mark Holtz,1/1,1329350400,Delicious Jerky!,If you have been disappointed by the jerky sold in the stores. order this stuff instead. The Sweet Chipolte jerky is very flavorful. yet the meat was soft and tender. and easy to pull apart. While a little more expensive. you can taste the difference. Trust me. you will Krave more of this jerky.
27920,B003GZJQXI,A3S2IJMBXI7K6X,Anders C. Olson Anders,1/1,1332374400,Excellent Flavor - Reduced FAT!,I just got a case of these in the mail which I ordered on S&S a few days ago and I must say that are delicious.  I have tried the traditional cheddar puffs as well as spicy curls and I enjoyed both flavor so this is a nice combination of the two.  The flavor is just slightly spicy with a nice cheddar taste.  At 130 calories/serving and only .5 grams of saturated fat these are a great snack for anyone watching their intake.
27927,B004QK24C2,A1SYJ0JI4QQGVZ,apettway,2/2,1316736000,great flavor,I use the hazelnut flavor to make  my own coffee syrup.  It smells great and tastes great.  It's does a great job  of saving me money on the syrup I was purchasing at my favorite coffee shop.
27935,B000I200NW,A1XZF9Y0O61CMH,Mwaa sister321,1/1,1322524800,I got the 2-lb Bellagio Chocolate Truffle!,Hey. every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine---every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.<br /><br />Ive also tried Neuhaus. Chirardelli and other store brands. but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.<br /><br />Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys brand. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.<br /><br />Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this brand because of high caloric content -- 700 calories for the venti)<br /><br />So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me. Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.
27946,B0000WKTY0,A3IUM4F9VVW70I,Pam,1/1,1283040000,It's so good!,We purchased this product in Kauai. HI while on vacation and it is absolutely fantastic.  I find myself wishing we had bought a few bottles to bring home!
27951,B000LKZ94G,A2XK5OLQSAEZX6,M. Ames,0/0,1276732800,Great Pasta!,First we tried Tinkyada rice pasta and we could eat it but it was mushy and soft. This brand tastes better too and holds up just like wheat pasta if you don't evercook it.  It is good reheated and can be eaten in cold dishes.  My son loves it.  The animal shapes are fun. I also like that it is organic and whole grain.
27954,B002BG38X2,A3N8RB943DMSH7,Alisa Marie Fleming GoDairyFree.org,6/6,1267228800,Nice Creamy Soup with Good Flavor,This is a purely smooth and silky soup. not a bean or veggie chunk to be found. I loved the consistency actually; it was like a light cream rather than a starchy thick soup. But. I can never leave well enough alone. I saut&eacute;ed three sweet carrots in 1 teaspoon of oil. then added the soup to heat. and served it up with some chopped avocado. The combination was delightful.<br /><br />The soup on its own had a wonderful taste and just the right amount of flavor in terms of heat (not too much!). spices. and salt. Nothing was over the top. and it all melded rather nicely. There was just one note that kept tasting off to me. It was mostly in the aftertaste. so it didn't deter me from devouring the bowl. Nonetheless. it left me curious. so I checked the ingredients and finally spotted the culprit ... cilantro paste. Yes. I am one of those cilantro supertasters who generally dislike it. Cilantro fans will find this soup spot on. but luckily. the cilantro is far enough down the ingredient list that even most cilantro tastes like soap people (such as me) will enjoy it.<br /><br />I will purchase this soup again either for a quick lunch. or as a recipe starter ... it has great potential! Plus. I love that it is both dairy-free and soy-free.

He gets very insistent that I put honey on top of his oatmeal. so I like the fact that this instant stuff has a little bit less sugar on it than it used to have. I love how easy it is to make. and it is great that my son can help me make it in the morning. In addition to the honey. we also usually add a couple heaping tablespoons of yogurt to it. so that it cools down faster.

28098,B007POT6RM,AE61FFT0GUD2G,Frederick S. Goethel wildcatcreekbooks,0/0,1346284800,Not The Same Product of Years Past. Bust Still Good For A Fast. Hot Breakfast,In years past. I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick. easy. hot breakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically. and although it was sweet-ish. I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did. however. have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition. the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires. at a minimum. two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product. and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However. as part of a variety pack. I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal. but do not have the time to cook it from scratch.
28102,B007POT6RM,AAJB79DB0AIEL,Paul Pavao Shammah,0/0,1345680000,Making Oatmeal Edible,It's hard to believe that these might actually be healthy. but I love these flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals.<br /><br />And they might actually be healthy! Though sugar is the second ingredient. whole grain rolled oats is the first ingredient in every flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal. including this Maple Brown Sugar. which is a favorite of mine. Further. each serving (one packet) contains only four grams of sugar in the low sugar form and nine grams in the regular form. which is one to two teaspoons.<br /><br />Yeah. one or two teaspoons.<br /><br />I went through the rest of the ingredients on the Maple Brown Sugar flavor and on several others. and almost every other ingredient is an ingredient you'd find in a vitamin pill. The Apples & Cinnamon even has dehydrated apples (ahead of sugar. which is the third ingredient in that flavor).<br /><br />I'm recovering from chemotherapy and radiation. I had a bone marrow transplant in January (2012). and my new immune system sometimes goes after my gut when we lower my immunosuppressives. Thus. eating food that is high in fiber and gentle on the stomach and intestines is important for me. It's important for you. too. because the fiber in oats is excellent for your heart.<br /><br />The problem is. it's hard for me to find oatmeal edible without adding a lot more brown sugar than Quaker does! That's always been true. but it's especially true when I'm recovering from leukemia treatments. At first. there was a VERY limited set of food items I could eat without throwing up. (Sorry for being so graphic.) These flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals let me eat gentle. heart-healthy oatmeal without hating the flavor. I love almost every one. They're a go-to food for me when I'm nauseous.<br /><br />I know you probably aren't recovering from a blood cancer. but if you're wanting to eat oatmeal because it's healthy. this is a great way to eat it.<br /><br />And for lazy people. it's a one-bowl cleanup. Pour the packet in the bowl. pour boiling water over it. and wait a minute (or less if you're impatient like me). Eat it. and you have one bowl and no pots to wash (or throw in the dishwasher).
28105,B007POT6RM,AE2MKYLMTYF21,M. T. Pope,0/0,1345680000,Great product,Though i'm not a huge fan of oatmeal. this product delivers on great taste and convenience. All i have to do is grab a pack and get a cup of hot water from Starbucks for my morning breakfast. It's simple. filling and a great combination for me.I say go get this product for taste and convenience.
28132,B007POT6RM,AN0U0GNJJPEUR,N. Rogers,0/0,1342569600,my favorite flavor,Instant oatmeal is my go-to breakfast whenever I have to work the very early morning shift.  I just pour the packet into a mug and add hot water from the dispenser on the coffee maker.  Quaker's Maple Brown Sugar is pretty good. but I think the Safeway brand is just a little tastier.  Quaker's version just doesn't have quite enough brown sugar in my opinion.  Since I had a box of Safeway's. I decided to compare.  They're pretty similar with the same calories and grams of fat. but when it comes to nutrients the Safeway version is slightly more nutritious.  For example. Quaker has 15% Vitamin A and 8% Calcium while Safeway has 20% Vitamin A and 10% Calcium.  Going down the list. Safeway is either equal to or better in each category.
28137,B007POT6RM,A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,Mediahound,0/0,1342396800,Great taste. seems healthier,I suppose this is a new formula since Quaker is marketing this as 'heart healthy' and whole grain.<br /><br />To me. it tastes as good as any other Quaker Instant Oatmeal that I've tried in the past so I do not hesitate to recommend this one.<br /><br />That said. I am not an oatmeal connoisseur; if you are very picky about your oatmeal. then your mileage may vary so to speak. I do like less fattening and more healthy foods so would probably purchase this one over a less healthy version.
28148,B007POT6RM,A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J,N. Beitler Avid Reader,0/0,1342051200,Quaker Instant Oatmeal,Quaker Instant Oatmeal is such a healthy and filling breakfast.  I like to start my day with a five mile run and when I come home this is my breakfast of choice. especially in the winter.  My favorite way to fix it is by dumping a packet of oatmeal. 1/2 cup of water and I always add 2 tablespoons of Old Fashion Oats too.  Cook it for a minute and then add cinnamon. raisins and milk.  It is sweet and healthy--a great mix!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy foods. yet has a sweet tooth.
28157,B007POT6RM,A3CHMHGSJSQ02J,Anon. A. Non,0/0,1341878400,A little sweet for my tastes,I should probably have realized that Maple AND Brown Sugar would make for a sweet product... but I figured maybe they used both in moderation. I was wrong.<br /><br />But adding a little milk cuts down the sweetness without watering down the oatmeal. This is still a much better bowl of oatmeal than my local supermarket store brand (and there's more oatmeal per packet). and I actually like it better than McCann's. which I have always found to be a little slimy.
28171,B0067EO5Q8,A2DTZUZK9YRJVK,clearanceman,0/0,1347667200,Very good cereal,Tastes great. doubt it's very good for you. too much sugar.  But everyone in my family loves it. I can't buy it all the time because they eat too much of it. but it is one of the best tasting cereals ever. IMO.
28188,B008L9O0W6,A3429OY0M0D5GT,Sandy C. hansancru,2/3,1200614400,Old time taste,We have really enjoyed the old time taste of this popcorn. I made a mistake and ordered two boxes but now am glad I did. Will probably have to order more sooner than expected. Thanks for the quality product--
28212,B002ZOCEOY,A1PRA2LNI0FXO7,Paul Lubin,0/0,1323734400,8 o'clock coffee,We have tried several whole bean hazelnut coffees. including gourmet ones. and like this one best...and Amazon had the best price.
28224,B000V9PH4O,A2OUYF5QAFVDGZ,N. A. Cummings Horror Chick,4/4,1208131200,Perfect Blend,Hey. the smell is wondrous and its very soothing. The taste of the white tea and  blueberry pomegranate are perfectly blended. The pack of six is well worth it. this tea will become your go to tea for everyday! Enjoy
28238,B000V9PH4O,A3K0GNYLOMDSUZ,M. Walker,0/0,1245196800,nice. mild tea,This is a fine (though perhaps not spectacular) tea.  I found the flavors--both the tea flavor and the fruit flavors--to be a little on the mild side for my taste. even when seeping the tea for significantly longer than the instructions recommend.  So if you prefer bold flavors. I would suggest you look elsewhere.  But if you prefer lighter. milder flavors. this is a very pleasant product.
28258,B0029TZW8K,A27GPXG538KWHU,kabbalah,0/0,1313884800,delicious,Delicious. Bought both these grape ones and the strawberry. I prefer the grape. my wife the strawberry. I used to buy llicorice from Allan's candy in Canada. They made the best licorice belts that were a flat kind of ribbon about 1/2 inch wide. They stopped making them for some reason. Now I find the Gustafs brand the best licorice.
28303,B000RFS57I,AN219MRF28Q2R,wojo robertwojo,0/0,1325116800,Great flavor. now has a resealable bag,Ordered two bags a while ago and they were a hit with anyone that came over that wanted a quick snack. The old order didn't have resealable bags which caused them to dry out (yes. I should have put them into a bag myself). but the new ones come with a zip-lock built into the bag. Bonus!<br /><br />I put this one on a Amazon subscription -- I don't want to run out ;)
28330,B001390KXY,A2A5RH6MNBEKZ3,E. Gershon Just Me & Tea,2/2,1226188800,Best Turkey Ever,I've been using Nantucket Offshore Turkey Rub for about 8 years... maybe longer.  I always get tremendous raves at the table. so  much so. that after numerous requests and years of begging ... what is the secret ... I had to let my friends and family know.<br />Now I have received so many thank you's. not only from my friends and family. but also by their children. their family and friends too.<br />Everyone I have told about this product are so thankful and tell me how easy it was for them to use it and how delicious everything is.<br />I've also told them that I use it in my stuffing/dressing. gravy/sauce. my turkey soup etc.  Also. I works great with chicken and duck.  This is one of the best. most used product in my kitchen... I use about 2-3 tins of Nantucket Offshore Turkey Rub. per year and so do my friends.<br />One of my friends just moved to PA. so I ordered a couple of tins and sent it to her and she called me and said. You saved our Thanksgiving!...
28342,B0029JDZCK,A307ISA4AOH6D9,K. Manthey,0/0,1300752000,Not Into Sour Candies...,Let me start by saying that I love Skittles and Starburst. I love to sprinkle Skittles in my pop-corn to get that sweet/salty/fruity/crunchy combination. And Starburst? Well. who needs to do anything but eat them! That being said. I think this particular assortment is a waste of my money because half the box is SOUR editions of both these candies. I do NOT enjoy sour ANYTHING and especially NOT my candy! Candies should be SWEET. Hence the saying; sweet as candy... I WON'T buy this again! I guess I should have read the description better. if it even says so...<br /><br />Okay. so went I back to check. and it DOES NOT state that this variety box contains half the contents in SOUR. So I came back to edit my review and let others know that fact.
28357,B000YUOY30,A3BLP7LRNCAT2Y,Liliana maccentris,3/3,1264723200,A disappointment!,For the price I expected much. much better.  It says it should be used within a month but (unless it's used by one person/one cup per day) this wont last anymore than a couple of weeks.  It is not as concentrated (I had to pump 3-4 times). and the past reviewer is right it is not as rich as the refrigerated kind.  We have three people who drink coffee here. it was gone in 2 weeks.<br /><br />I was upset about it gone so soon. but felt some liquid left behind in the bottle; unfortunately the nozzle can't be removed due to a lock system it has; once it's on. its on for good!  I took a butter knife to open the cap and to my surprise there was enough liquid there for at least 5 more cups of coffee!<br /><br />On top of that the second bottle kept clogging even with twice daily use.  And now Amazon had raised the price!  I decided to go with the plain creamer this time. much more economical.  I will test and review it as soon as I finish the first bottle I hope it works better for us.<br /><br />It very pricey. sure no mess. no hassle if you've got loads of money there's really nothing to worry about.  But for someone in a budget. I honestly believe it doesn't amount to the value of the one from the dairy/coffee section.  Save your bucks. this is not worth it.
28370,B000YUOY30,A3QH2NTJ2TGIVU,DOCTOR,0/0,1313452800,Aaahhhhhh...,Got exactly what I ordered.  Normally get these from Sam's Club. but got here on Amazon for the same price.  Perfect!
28372,B000YUOY30,A2TBM0GHWUB46X,Debbie Oelrich,0/0,1299974400,Tastes Great!!,This is great convenience to have on my counter next to my Keurig and Kcups!<br />I really think this is a great value too!
28382,B007OXJMD2,ATUKFS2QNASEP,Raspberry girl,2/2,1311724800,Amazing for iced coffee drinks!,I rarely review. but I had to extend kudos to Green Mountain for this wonderful hazelnut flavor.  I make mostly iced coffees. and wanted to stop spending so much money at Starbucks.  This coffee is better than Starbucks. Coffee Bean. or any other shop I've tried.  It is light. sweet. and you almost don't need any extra sugar if you add a little milk.  I should note that I like my coffee pretty light.  I also love that this is available in decaf.  I hope they make more decaf flavors available over time.  I adore my Breville single cup coffee maker as well!
28386,B007OXJMD2,A23T0OX6JJOV7O,C. Parisi,0/0,1345075200,Good Taste for decaf,A nice flavored coffee in decaf.  Not many flavors in decaf.  A good bargin in k-cups.<br />It's a smooth cup of coffee.
28387,B007OXJMD2,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,audrey,0/0,1344556800,good deal on K-cups,We were given a Keurig coffee machine for a gift. We really like the ease and convenience of use. but the K-cups can be very expensive. I've done extensive comparison shopping. and this particular deal is the best I've found (in online or retail stores. and even different packs here on Amazon). There are not a lot of K-cup decaffeinated choices. but since I like hazelnut flavor. this is a good choice for me.<br /><br />This is a nice mild hazelnut decaf at a good price.
28404,B007OXJMD2,A214A74RTIM7YX,Dori Bruce,0/0,1322006400,Great Product!,These are my favorite flavor of K Cups and I received them very quickly after ordering. Would absolutely order again and recommend to others!
28415,B000HLLDXU,AHJASB3WJLXLC,Sarah Maki Declan and Ian's mum,2/2,1313193600,Yuck.,I don't know... maybe I got a bad batch. The pastry was sandy in texture. broken in a million pieces by the time it got here. I reconstructed one to give it a try. The filling had a strange. bitter taste; the bad aftertaste was horrible. Such a shame. because I have enjoyed other Mr. Kipling products. Try Mr. Kipling's Cherry Bakewells (yum!) or Battenbergs. I wouldn't even give these a second try.
28460,B0016FRI8A,A3GLC45MF00NFF,A. Padua,0/0,1318377600,Just had a glass today,When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try. particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened. sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all. mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said natural. I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle. however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content. you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong mint flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats. such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)
28485,B0016FRI8A,A1VQKT0EFQ3Q2K,Susan smplocher,1/2,1268352000,Great product - at last!,LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment. right?)  The flavor is great. ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long. the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!
28524,B000OF71Y4,A2HBT3VRUU6HG3,Diane M.,0/0,1338076800,Weak Coffee,Bought this coffee to take on vacation to use in the little 4-cup pots that are always in hotel rooms.  My husband. the coffee drinker. said it was very weak (even using two packs at one time). I threw away the rest. Save your money...buy something else.
28544,B0089SPEO2,ATVAXMCSYVATX,M. Ellis Superchop728,2/2,1293926400,Great price for great tea,You have to really search for good deals on tea and this tea is great fro the price.  Some tea on Amazon is almost a $1/cup! this is the same price as the K-cup coffee and some of the herbal varieties have low or no caffine which is a good option for my pregant wife that used to have the after dinner coffe with me.
28553,B0089SPEO2,A1VLILQVZDDLBG,Darryl S. Cully,0/0,1341792000,Tea for thee,My wife loves this tea ever since I got a Kurig coffee maker for her. I will order more when she runs out.
28587,B0089SPEO2,A2L1GGYOIQKOCY,Hillbillie ~usually barefooted,0/0,1320105600,My favorite Celestial Seasonings Tea :o),I always keep plenty of this tea on hand. as it's not only my favorite. but a favorite of everyone who stops over for some hot tea during the Fall and Winter.<br />(I always have to show off my Keurig at every opportunity---I love that machine and think everyone who drinks coffee or tea should have one!)<br /><br />The flavor of the CS Mandarin Orange tea reminds me of the Friendship Tea (Tang. Nestea instant tea and Lemonade drink mixes. sugar. spices---sometimes called Russian Tea -- that I remember from when I was a child. It's a bold. flavorful tea that is perfect for chilly nights. And it smells wonderful while it's brewing. :o)
28588,B0089SPEO2,A1EJMN9YOAXNGW,J. M. Smith,0/0,1314748800,Mandarin Orange Spice Tea,Excellent taste-with orange spicey flavor  fairly priced<br />Tea is helpful with an upset stomach and when coffee just does not hit the spot..
28597,B0089SPEO2,A321B5DIQCYBLK,RC from GA,0/0,1282435200,My wife loves it...,I don't drink tea but my wife loves lemon zinger. She puts a little honey in it and I have to admit. it tastes good. We got our tea k-cups from [...] so I can't comment on the seller that Amazon gets theirs through.
28634,B000FKAYO2,AOD9WK3W00EDU,Lolo,0/0,1264896000,Awesome Gluten-Free Pasta Brand,All of Tinkyada's pasta is pretty wonderful.  I can't tell you how many Gluten-free pasta brands I have tried and at best they have been gross!  Finally. I found Tinkyada and I have never been disappointed.  I think this is my absolute favorite Tinkyada type (the Fusilli). but I also love the fettucini. the lasagna noodles. the elbows and shells.
28638,B000FKAYO2,A324KM3YY1DWQG,danitrice,0/0,1251072000,The Best!!,I highly rec'md this pasta...obviously!  Seriously though...it is easy to make. and it tastes great!  I have never had a bad batch of it!  It comes in the 16 ounce size...which I prefer (one bag instead of the typical two with gluten free).  I would give this product ten stars!
28661,B003EH6P9Q,A2HGW0QBBAEEA4,Fla Nuker,0/0,1338768000,Love this stuff,Being a shift worker. I need a kick butt. good tasting coffee on wake up. no matter what time of the day that is.  Revv fits that bill.  If you need a bold. rich full bodied coffee to get you going in the morning. this is it.
28663,B003EH6P9Q,A3BWR5SPJVBS,Tony di Filippo,0/0,1330041600,Good Tasting Coffee,I love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can.  I usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee & the first cup I had of this brew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one.  I then dropped the cup size down one notch. made a second cup and found what I was looking for.  Tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup & they did not compare to the rich aroma & fine taste that I'm now getting with Revv
28676,B00401OY6Q,A1WSZZ6QYGYXB7,walle,0/0,1335139200,Delicious,I have been been drinking aloe drinks for years. This is the best flavor and freshest aloe drink out there. I've tried many brands in different Asian markets. I recommend everyone try this. I bought this flavor 3 times already.

Its healthy! Delicious! and good for your skin! :) alo is packed with vitamins and other natural minerals to deliver the best drink you will ever try. i buy them at my local grocery store and have probably bought over 75 over the summer . definitely worth a try:)
28704,B0019NC8F2,A26SYXM0IZMYPN,David,0/0,1347062400,salt,It came on time and was in good shape and no slat was linking out of the box so I would buy more soon.
28710,B000KOSMWE,ADMX0OCB1D2UP,Ryan G. Vollmer,3/3,1310947200,Awesome!,Have no idea what the dude is talking aboout concerning plastic taste. Maybe they cooked it too long (though that would be kind of absent minded). but they taste great. I just wish it was a tad cheaper.
28714,B000QV2GSM,A12G8QQYLKYMM2,BethC1967,1/1,1301270400,Finally she learned out to do it!,I had nearly given up on my dogs learning how to use this machine.  I had seen so many dogs on youtube and people saying they figured it out in 5 minutes...I was thinking that my dogs were NEVER going to figure it out! They would scratch and scratch on it and just could not seem to reach up and hit the lever.  I would get so frustrated watching them that I would end up pressing the lever for them.  I think they had me trained! Finally. after 4 months. they figured it out! They are so cute working the lever.  This is a great toy and I would highly recommend it.  It is very durable and well made.  I think I enjoy it as much as my puppies do.
28715,B000QV2GSM,A3U9SJQF7V8ZP1,aalakes,1/1,1289001600,Yuppy Puppy treat machine,This is our second machine. Both this dog and our previous dog love it. It's easy to train them and they enjoy accessing their treats. Wrigley takes laundry to the hamper and then is rewarded by clicking her treat machine. Our friends are amused by her ability to know when she can and cannot retrieve her reward. It's fun!
28716,B000QV2GSM,A3JAITM5A93M0U,D. & V. Stanley D. & V. Stanley,0/0,1344988800,not for our dog,Our dog has not figured out how to use this toy.  He loves food and eats it quickly if we put it in his bowl but is not particularly curious and tends to leave things he does not see as his alone.  For instance. he will not bother an open bag of dog food if it is in the pantry and easily accessible to him.  Our dog's brother has a similar toy and figured it out with few demonstrations.  Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.  It's easiest done with a screwdriver.  I don't think you should have to need a screwdriver to fill food but the way this is constructed. if you don't use one. the lid remains loose. You will need a small scoop or a funnel to not make a mess filling it.
28738,B00061EOHI,AXN4L9WOCH1NW,Elena M. Woodard Munchie,0/0,1316390400,LOVE this Popcorn!,This popcorn is delicious!  You know how some popcorn can be tasteless. sort of like styrofoam?  This popcorn has a really nice corn taste and seems to have less hulls.  It is the only popcorn I have been able to eat while having braces on my teeth.  It is not easy to find in the stores. so being able to purchase this on Amazon is nice.

28768,B0002VXZ40,A6DDURQU0A4TU,Warm Puppy,2/2,1321574400,Love 'em - and they are hot!,Wow. I can't believe I just placed my fourth order for the 5 lbs. pack. Compared to the Hapi wasabi peas at the grocery store. these are about 27% of the price. a great savings. But there are other differences to consider. These peas are hotter. saltier and harder than the Hapi product. With the Hapi peas. there is no way I can achieve a good wasabi burn. even by the mouthful. But don't fill your mouth with these. Three or four at a time give me plently of heat. And around 8 to 10 of these at once leave me screaming for a quick and painless death - I love it!<br /><br />As others have noted. these peas are harder too. Not rock hard. but every once in a while I find one where it is simply better to discard it than risk any damage. I always chew on these gently. to avoid any issues. If you are a fan of burning your nasal hair with wasabi heat. try them! If not. better stick with the Hapi line. Both are good to me. it just depends on which mood I am in.
28773,B0002VXZ40,A3N7KOM9U1TXSZ,Aaronjon Aaronjon,1/1,1275091200,Wasabi Pea Addiction,I have a Wasabi Pea addiction. Its not pretty. but its true.<br /><br />Having tried all kinds of Wasabi Peas. here's my review of these in context:<br /><br />- Hot 7/10<br />- Salty 7/10<br />- Wasabi Flavor 7/10<br />- Crunch<br /><br />Other than my annoyance that these peas have food coloring in them to make them look more Green. and the fact that they do not score the highest on the Flavor scale (meaning how much does it taste like actual Wasabi...is the flavor well-rounded. etc). they are<br /><br />PRETTY DARN GOOD. (7/10)<br /><br />The 5Lb bag probably would have been large enough to have let some of them go stale if you didn't divide it up into smaller bags...but I ate them in 1 month. and the flavor did not suffer in that time.<br /><br />Enjoy!

28795,B0002VXZ40,A1GUFQ4M5RFW1P,R. Conatser,0/0,1285718400,Great Peas At A Reasonable Price!,I have ordered four 5lb bags from this seller total. one on each occasion. I'd give a four and a half star review if I could. simply because the second bag of peas had quite a few hard peas inside. The other 3 bags have been consistently excellent! Unlike a few other brands I've tried. they taste very fresh. and very well seasoned. I will be purchasing more from this seller in the future. but I am always looking for new brands (that are comparatively priced) to try. If you have any you recommend. leave a link in the comments! A++ seller and A+ product.
28806,B000FFVYF0,A3H9DFV0SM9UQ6,AnonyGrl,2/2,1253059200,Extremely crunchy,I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for. (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately. it did not suit me. On the up side. it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.

Now they're from Monterrey Mexico.  Same great taste?  Who knows.  I hadn't had any for years until I wolfed my way through one of these boxes.  They taste good enough. but I'll never know if they were like the originals from York.  Why does something like this need to be imported?
28877,B000NME632,A1HH1DPK1ASVDN,Zolton Veni. Vidi. Reviewi.,7/19,1280793600,Sweet. yes. Alpine. not so much.,I've been suffering through an incredibly hot season. more sauna than summertime. I've had enough sweat rolling down my back to charge neighborhood kids three bucks a pop for a Slip 'N' Slide ride. and I'm finally at the end of my sweaty rope. I came here looking for something. anything. to help me beat the summer heat.<br /><br />I've watched those Peppermint Pattie commercials for years. Eating one gives 'the sensation of shushing down a snow-capped mountain.' they say. It's like 'yodeling in the frigid Alpine snow.' they tell me. It feels like 'a giant soothing Sno-Cone down your pants on a hot August afternoon'. So they say. in these commercials.<br /><br />Hogwash.<br /><br />On a particularly sweltering recent afternoon. I put their advertising to the test. I ate forty-six of these little patties -- and I got a 'sensation'. all right. Not of skiing or crooning or cooling my undies. though. More like the feeling of three pounds of chocolate crammed down my colon. and a faint minty tinge to all five senses. You ever HEARD peppermint? I can't recommend it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Eat a Pattie if you're looking for a nice sweet treat. But if you're suffering through a summertime heat wave? Drop in a Sno-Cone. Your colon -- and your BVDs -- will thank you.
28880,B0012N65LC,A2P00L8ZU3AVLW,HoneyMaven,1/1,1277424000,Broken to Bits...,These wafers taste incredible under normal circumstances but the six tins are a crumbled mess of smashed chocolate sticks. They should have written 'fragile' on the box. It's literally a pile of chocolate goo and crumbs. I will not order again...

28903,B000OBZZ1Y,A3O0KZXWPK9X92,L & O,1/1,1338249600,1 liter bottle - good oil!,This is a good quality oil and a nice. tasty brand.  The label of the bottle shows it is 1 liter - slightly more than 1 quart - of  oil.  We like to use this type of oil because it seems so natural. and we have allergies to soy in our home.  So much oil in the grocery stores is canola (popular with producers because birds and animals will not touch the plants). or vegetable which is always a soy-blend. and usually a GMO product.  Try it. and enjoy.
28910,B0052RRO2I,A2M5UJHU5R5N7G,Thomas P. Page,1/1,1332892800,Home Grown!,We are trying to grow all our own food and this sprout is a good addition for our dietary needs. Great price for Organic as well.

Hope in the future all of them will have a seal on them. All arrived in good shape and in a timely matter.
28939,B000F70SO6,AFC84OC23E6H1,K. Torres health nut,3/4,1162598400,Tasty but a bit too much honey,This is a very good bar. There are lots of nuts and different kinds of fruit. but there is a bit too much sweetener (honey. etc). Good for breakfast. or half of one as a snack to get me through to lunch/dinner.<br /><br />Great price! Cheaper than Kind bars. although not as many different kinds available.

28964,B001ACNWY8,A2KBVZYIPWKSVA,M. Sipple,1/1,1271894400,Very Good,My son has several allergies.  We were looking for anything that we could use that would pass as bread for his school lunches.  We were just hoping that it would be good enough. but we were surprised with Chebe.  It is actually very good.  We all liked it.  With the second batch we tried to make. the dough came out very sticky.  We called Chebe customer service and they helped us figure out the problem.  Very fast and friendly.  They even replaced the goofed up batch.  It is perfect for sandwiches at lunch and with jelly on it for breakfast.
28969,B001ACNWY8,AAKC17VPVHQUI,Mom to Three Lori,0/0,1330732800,Awesome!!!,We LOVE this product!!! Myself and three children have multiple food allergies and this mix is actually something everyone can and will eat (very rare). I make everything out of it from pizza crust to a loaf of bread to hamburger buns. even cookies!  Go to their website and they have recipes available. This mix is so versatile I can get very creative and pretty much make anything from it.
28975,B001ACNWY8,A1DRTH012A377N,ItoYou ItoYou,0/0,1290729600,good. not worth 5.00 dollar increase.,Have been using product over 2 years.  Had to play with manufacture recipe on bag.  Use 1 egg yolk and 2 egg whites then added extra rice milk to make up for lost egg yolk. added tsp sugar then other spices to taste.  Use plastic lined tortilla press. Work fast dough changes with room moisture.  Could buy 8 bags for 18.-- dollars now with 5.00 increase buying locally is cheaper.

I used my vitamix to make the dough and it was a bit too much for it (sticky) - unfortunately hand blended is easier on kitchen equipment.  But you don't have to worry about handling the dough too much.  The thinner the end product the better it cooks inside. My current fav is a mini french bread loaf.  Crispy outside and slightly 'holey' inside. I made cheese bread sticks in with the plain mix and kneeding shredded cheese into it.  There is a slight odd. but not objectionable. taste which dipping in chili or smearing with butter covers up.  Next project - PIZZA!!!!!
28988,B001ACNWY8,AS6RD73FUKG6V,Robert Johnson,0/0,1236816000,Quick mix!,I have to eat gluten free and I'm allergic to rice and yeast.  This is really limiting. in terms of bread products. more so than most celiacs.  I buy a ton of these mixes because they taste good and mix up quickly.  I bake them in my toaster oven and can have a bun to make a sandwich in less than half an hour.  My favorite is the pizza mix. but the All-Purpose Mix is the one I use the most.
28999,B004X6B2JA,A30UH19KB2TOTG,L. Payne,1/1,1327708800,My dogs love these treat,These are inexpensive great treats. I bought them at Walmart several times and Walmart is always sold out because they are a great deal. I decided to go to the web to find them. The 18 ounce bag is actually 72 small bones. The picture says 7. but it is 72. My two spoiled dogs love them. I am glad to find them on this web site so I can purchase them. Buying enough bags for free shipping makes it easier than going to Walmart every week to find they are sold out.
29003,B000SDX1NW,AS0MJOXBZNO79,dittywook,3/3,1316822400,RIP OFF,Initially I was so excited to find this gift basket - it seemed perfect for a reasonable price.  I received the product today and was terribly disappointed when seeing it.  Honestly  it looks like yunk that you MIGHT buy for $12 to $15 but CERTAINLY NOT $50!!  I will be sending this back ASAP and recommend that others do not waste their time and money on this cheap. tacky product.
29021,B000A0WLFC,A1HH7L6EJI6N0,Paul Fillmore,4/5,1230940800,Great gift,I received this as a gift for xmas of 2007 and I really liked it. The insanity sauce will rot before I ever finish it but the other sauces are really great. In the year since receiving it I have kept stock of Dave's products and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys spicy food. The wood 'crate' did fall apart though it didn't affect my rating.
29026,B000A0WLFC,A2APTZBEYY2GYK,me,0/0,1331856000,insanely good,i received product on time and as described. If you like hot sauces. this is the assortment for you. Highly recommended
29034,B000OZFET8,A3HIB8R59RNYNV,Cyborg RoadRunner,5/6,1316390400,Outstanding product,This is true high quality methi seed. For those that are familiar with this spice. nough said. and for those that are not I can only ask you to try it in your gourmet cooking. You will find many different reviews on it on the net. some filed with blessings and some filled with warnings. This plant compatibility is very specific. so to evaluate you need to try and decide for yourself. Nobody said that Eskimos and Somali will be happy on the same diet. To explain details: do you remember those small cubes of whatever with names like instant chicken soup or something like that? Well. those are now. by our modern standards made of things that you would be reluctant today to give to your dog. The funny thing is. they are still in production and people eat it. Here now is the real thing that started it all. natural. no nonsense. used by generations in many places like Argentina. China. India and few other countries for hundreds of years. It is called Fenugreek. Buy it. add one tea spoon to a quart of your soup before boiling. and find out how it makes your meal wholesome. healthy. custom and aromatic. If you prefer macaroni and cheese flushed with aspartame and saccharine US food this is most likely not for you and you should stick to your plastic burgers. but if you are searching for wholesome and specific flavors combines with medicinal values. this product will be just what you need in your kitchen. When I got it opened in my house. the oh my God... was what I have heard from wife and kids. Then I purchased 5 more bags and vacuum packed it. You get an idea. LOL<br />Remark: this is high quality dehydrated natural seed. just like premium dry rice. so if you want to get what it does. pour hot water over a bit of it and let it stand for 24 hours. then taste and decide.

29041,B000MPRP4C,A2QL0E8NVNFZFU,Golf4me,0/0,1347062400,Best tea for the ol' Brown Betty,While living for a month in Scotland in a self catering we had settled into this tea from the Co-Op as our favorite. When we returned to the states we put away our coffee machine and went with pots of tea for breakfast. Great stuff! The longer you steep it the fuller the flavor ... max about 8 minutes. Brought home 4 boxes in our suitcases. The tea was so good we donated clothes to the local charity to make room for it. When we got back to the states and ran out we replinished our supply with Amazon ... thanks for being so global Amazon! :-) Cheers!

29074,B002ZJ3C18,A19XBW5WUDH1Z,David Nox,2/2,1286582400,Contains MSG,I relied on the ingredients listed on Amazon's site.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Peanuts. Dry Roast Seasoning. Tapioca Dextrin. Natural Flavoring. Salt.<br /><br />Guess what? When the product arrived I read the laundry list of about 20 other ingredients.<br />According to the actual label the Dry Roast seasoning contains MSG.<br />Now I'm not that paranoid about MSG but if the product has it as an ingredient it should have been listed on Amazon.<br />I wish they had shown the nutrition label. It also contains added sugar.<br />What's wrong with plain dry roasted peanuts?<br />The taste is about what you would expect. Peanuts with a flavor coating.<br />I will not buy them again.<br />Also it is a 12 pack.
29077,B000NU8H0C,A3D9S9NEXE2H9J,Kelly Scott,2/2,1323043200,Ummm...No,This product arrived and I was happy. LOVE Izze's. however. what I thought I was getting was four. 4-pks of 12-oz sparkling juice. not the one 4-pk.  If that was the case. I could've went to my local store and picked-up the case for $5!  This is definitely going back. talk about inflation :-

29112,B000N8JT6U,ACU8XG07FRY5D,Charmaine Magarian,2/2,1338249600,pumpkin pie spice,This product is a real bargain and better than the one from the grocery store.  We were paying $4.25 for a small bottle and this sure is less expensive and tasts better than the other brand. I would recommend it highly.
29125,B0002VXZ4A,A19I65RQ81490W,Miner90,0/0,1293840000,Addicting,I bought these thinking that two pounds would last us a month.  Try 3 days.  They pack some punch but won't rip your nose off with evey bite. and the peaqnut/wasabi flavor mix is great.
29128,B000FFVYFA,A1EJUI68G6UXBG,D. Berke bethany beach cats,7/7,1180656000,Out of this world!,If I could give these bars a 10. I would. They are by far the best tasting gluten free bar I have had. This brand. Kind Bars. use fresh ingredients with little processing. All varieties that I've had have been phenomenal. I can't say enough good things about them!
29135,B000FFVYFA,A3H9DFV0SM9UQ6,AnonyGrl,2/2,1253059200,Extremely crunchy,I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for. (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately. it did not suit me. On the up side. it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.

Barletta gymrat,1/1,1234051200,Badda Bing of Bars,Even though a little high in caolories/fat like all other bars. this is a healthy natural fiber filling alternative that actually tastes good too!  I  hope the fat calories don't catch up with me --- I keep a bar in my car when working it is like a quick fix snack!
29160,B000FFVYFA,A2YVIPKZGIK6W8,Nina_Houston,0/0,1287014400,Nice taste. but too tough to chew for me.,Nice taste. but too tough to chew for me. It has a good smell of coconut skin & not too sweet. However. I prefer the Kind Bar Almond & Apricot without yogurt (love it!) since the bar is softer/chewier.  If you like a bit sweeter taste. choose the one with yogurt.
29166,B000FFVYFA,A3C41LB5UXKN5N,Naomi Music Pug Lover,0/0,1255564800,Good and good for you!,This is my favorite flavor of Kind bars. Since it doesn't have that much fruit the carbs are lower (9 net) which is what I'm looking for. It is extremely crunchy. not chewy. but has great flavor. It definitely holds you over between meals. Good stuff!
29167,B000FFVYFA,A1O4QJPB9E2T4G,Jaclyn R. Fenstermacher Jackie,0/0,1255219200,YUMMY!!,These bars are great to keep in your purse or backpack for a quick snack.... AND they are GLUTEN FREE! Even better!

29207,B000PDY3P0,A3DV0I18XZ8Z86,Mike Medema,0/0,1350950400,Great for the price,I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall. the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag. I figure I'm getting a good deal. However. one issue I have is the large number of Old Maid unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands. so I'm not sure what is normal. but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels. you may want to avoid this brand. unless of course. it costs 25% more $.
29208,B000PDY3P0,A1RUO9T73M8A9R,Michael Dane,0/0,1350777600,BEST POPCORN EVER!,I wanted to find the same popcorn used in bars & at the movie theater and THIS IS IT! This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had! I have a kettle style corn popper and this is the only popcorn I'll ever buy again. I even popped the popcorn on the stove to see if it would taste the same and it did! This is the only popcorn you should buy!
29220,B000PDY3P0,A1PNUQIIRRQISI,Marian Bacis,0/0,1348963200,Best popcorn,So easy to use. No measuring just open the bag and dump everything in.  The combination of all the ingredients makes this popcorn so delicious.
29240,B000PDY3P0,A1HMYTI1US8J3O,Ralphie,0/0,1342483200,Pop Easy!,So easy to make popcorn with these everything-in-on portion packs.  All you do is load your popcorn machine with the premeasured amount of popcorn & flavored oil and you are good to go.  Couldn't be any easier & tastes great too!
29250,B000PDY3P0,A8QNV14F7U8O4,Daniel Hagquist Daniel,0/0,1338940800,Dan's Perfect Popcorn,Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe. but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops. put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops). pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot. use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion. starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges. since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing. because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily. add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.
29274,B000PDY3P0,A2WQ9XWTV61VLN,K. Hurley,0/0,1337817600,So convenient!!,If you've ever made popcorn in a machine you know what a pain it can be to get the right seasoning. the right oil taste and order decent popcorn that pops the way it should.  Once we started ordering the Great Northern Popcorn packets we didn't have to worry about it anymore.  It is so easy to make popcorn now because we don't have to measure anything or worry about the mess.  One easy step and we have perfect popcorn.  The kids can even do it!  I would definitely recommend giving this a try.
29291,B000PDY3P0,A2B12XV06AW08X,Susann,0/0,1337817600,delicious popcorn,Tried this popcorn and really enjoy the flavor of it.  Have recommended it to other people and even bought it for my brothers popcorn machine!!
29304,B000PDY3P0,AYU3SN4ILK7R,Joseph W. Langer,0/0,1337731200,Popcorn better than oil popped or microwave.,This is now our favorite popcorn. We have long since stopped using microwave popcorn because it was either too greasy or chewy. So. we went back to popping kernels in oil on the stove until we bought a popcorn machine. Now. we gave away our other popcorn and all we use is the Great Northern Popcorn portion packs. The popcorn comes out perfect everytime with great taste. It is salted just right. very light. and not greasy. Highly recommend this product.
29314,B000PDY3P0,A1OHL9G55LD3NQ,Laura Carriloo,0/0,1337731200,Can't go wrong,We love Great Northern Popcorn. we use it for fundraising and at home for our movie night.  It is easy to use and it is premeasured.  Taste is like movie theater popcorn. so yummy.  Can't go wrong with this purchase.

No muss. no fuss and great product to boot. I don't know how you could mess this up as everything is right there in the packet. Add a pan and lid or crank up your popcorn machine and in a few minutes you'll have some of the best popcorn you've ever put in your mouth. Excellent!

29343,B000PDY3P0,AJLZOLEVIAA92,Kevin J. Post,0/0,1336521600,love this popcorn,very happy with the popcorn.  I used it with my whirly popper stove top popcorn maker and just poured all the contents in the pot.  By having every bag sealed. you are sure that the popcorn is fresh and pops right.  the right amount of oil and seasoned salt.  No butter is added after. there is enough flavor from the oil and salt.
29344,B000PDY3P0,ALLSZRJL9YBCO,M. Hosler marlakh,0/0,1335484800,Great in theory,Perhaps I got an old batch. but I found the popcorn to be a bit stale when it popped up. In terms of ease of use. nothing could be simpler. Add the oil. turn the kettle on and when it's smoking add the popcorn and seasoning (and if you're me. when it's done popping put it in a bowl. drizzle with real butter and microplaned parmigianno reggiano- OMG SOOO good). No one else has complained about it tasting stale in my house so I might just be too picky. I'm not sure if we'll buy this brand again. but in the mean time it is working fine for us.

You simply cannot get any closer to real. movie theater popcorn. even if you were in the theater! This stuff is that good! And at about .77/ea pack. a great deal too. I honestly have no reason to go to the theater any more! With this popcorn and the theater size candy packs available cheap at the grocery store/Wal-Mart. a case of pop and you are there for pennies on the dollar! Oh. the best part. used a plain old dutch oven on the stove top to pop the corn and it came out perfect. Literally. the BEST popcorn I have ever made. hands down.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Yes. it's a little salty. but isn't that what you expect when you eat popcorn? This is the only kind that I don't have to add salt to.
29351,B000PDY3P0,A1JZGC3KVPAJVL,Nannyem,0/0,1333324800,Fantastic,We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the real deal.  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he.
29355,B000PDY3P0,AO462X5V79Z9N,Trudie,0/0,1332028800,Yummy~Delicious,Just like theater popcorn and exactly what I was looking for! I love it and will order more in the future. Some folks in my family think it is salty. Sometimes before I pop a pack. I pour the packet into a paper plate and remove some of the salt.  by separating the kernels from the salt mixture. Then I pour the kernels back into the packet and wait for the popcorn machine.
29359,B000PDY3P0,A2ZA47332X5R3T,April Woodard,0/0,1331337600,Makes great Popcorn,This stuff worked really well for a school fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and there were very few kernels left after it popped.  Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way. I just squeezed the package and it came right out.  Great product...I will purchase it again if we do another fundraiser.
29395,B000PDY3P0,A3Q3J468SIEG0L,TanyaS,3/3,1300060800,Great Northern PopCorn,The popcorn is good but if you want outstanding continue looking. It isn't overly buttery and if your wondering 1- 8oz bag makes 7- 1 1/2 oz bags.<br />My kids who are popcorn addicts like it. It works if your looking to sell it. I tried Gold Medal popcorn that was really good!!
29419,B000PDY3P0,A2OAIKW2C6CQHM,Jack Wolfson,0/0,1323388800,MOVIE THEATER POPCORN @ HOME !,BETTER than Movie Theater Popcorn at a bargain price. 3 Separate compartments in one pouch - one for seeds. one for salt. one for oil. Just add some Organic Butter with no salt. 4 oz. works great in my Ware popcorn maker. I make every day and am losing weight!
29451,B000PDY3P0,A8Y9GTKRY151U,OyVeyzMeir kanebear,0/0,1310428800,Excellent. but...,Just got a popper and bought some of this as well as some West Bend popcorn (which I tried with the Lou-Ana popcorn oil bars). I very much prefer these. More of the kernels popped. they were far fluffier. and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top. dump in the kettle. hit the heater. wait for the sound of the sizzle. and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off. then carefully 'roll' the pack. it makes it much easier to drop it all in. then squeeze the oil out.
29472,B000PDY3P0,A24IYZ80O60DTP,Wilpitz,0/0,1296864000,Easy and great!!!,What more can I say. just open. put into popcorn popper. eat the best tasting popcorn I have found!! I use this in my <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R>West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a> and my commercial popper with great results.
29486,B000PDY3P0,A1JKSY2BDRV78O,MUDSLINGER,0/0,1291680000,THEY SURE GOT THIS ONE RIGHT!,I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't tried it. but it's exactly like Movie Theatre popcorn! Delicious!  I have a 4-quart Whirley Pop stove top popper and the four ounce size size was just right.  It filled completely up and all of it popped.  And I noticed that there was very few husks.  Obviously. there's popcorn. and then there's popcorn!  Although some will probably complain because you have to cut the top off the package and squeeze to get the semi-solidified coconut oil out. it was no problem for me.  And certainly worth it!
29499,B000PDY3P0,A3HX59CB1YUGLJ,S. Lewis artist kimberly,3/3,1263686400,Very good popcorn,My family loves popcorn; the portioned packages work well.  the only suggestion that I would have is to cut the popcorn and seasoning part out first. place them in a measuring cup.  this will make it easier to pour in the pan for popping.  I spilled a significant amount of the seasoning and popcorn at first; and the fact that it's stored in plastic makes it not such a wise decision to place the plastic next to the hot pan.  of course put the butter in first. then add the popcorn and seasoning; less mess.<br /><br />just about every kernel pops.  very tasty!!!
29525,B000PDY3P0,A390EQQ4OUJVH,J. Lepley,0/0,1265846400,Great Northern popcorn portion packs,The great Northern popcorn popper we use these in seems to be used almost daily. since we have 8 and 10 year old girls. and their friends. who are always wanting a snack (specially after school). Although we also use the separate corn and oil also. the packs are just as good tasting. and sometimes a little handier when in a hurry. or out of the separate ingredients. The popcorn is very good either way.
29541,B000PDY3P0,A3GLT311Y1VXL9,Laurie Curlander,0/0,1254096000,The best!,This is the best popcorn. and so easy to make.  I love that it all comes in one packet and is perfectly seasoned. (I prefer my popcorn a little salty)!  This will be my third purchase and will continue to buy it as long as my popcorn maker survives!
29551,B000PDY3P0,ASY25YMTIC2A9,Steve,1/2,1306800000,Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn,My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night. after the kids are in bed. we turn out the lights. pop in a blu-ray. and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally. but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh. but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all. but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange. had a curdled/marbled look to it. and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date. but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid. so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up. it melted instantly. so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good. the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it. so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs. we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher. but didn't taste anywhere near as good. so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer. almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it. so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case. I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case. I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating. but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it. I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me. my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.
29587,B000PDY3P0,A2YGT2CIJ8AG7J,Adan Pena,0/2,1263254400,Disclaimer,I have just ordered this same product from Great Northern Popcorn website. It is about $30.00 cheaper than Amazon. Have not tried it yet so I don't know how it taste.
29600,B000PDY3P0,A2E2IEYWWNU4T5,Nicole Koch,0/4,1324080000,Terrible,I don't know why they're so many good reviews. but this popcorn is terrible!! Nothing like the movie theatres popcorn...save your money and stick with microwable bags!!

I have tried different kinds of popcorn. with different kinds of flavored oils and salts. but this is the best I have ever made at home.  I would love to have a batch of fresh movie-theater popcorn and a batch of this popcorn side by side. because I don't think I would be able to tell the difference.
29640,B000PDY3P0,A3RMI8YLCWVCY,S. Hudson,1/1,1318982400,Great Value. Great Popcorn!,Just the right mix of everything! Having all the ingredients in one package is convenient and mess free. I love the extra savings and convenience of using the subscription service too.  Because it's just my husband and me with occasional guests we have a case of 24 8 oz popcorn packs delivered every 3 months and the first package is just as fresh as the last. Thanks Great Northern and Thanks Amazon.
29641,B000PDY3P0,A38RMU1Y5TDP9,Bob Tobias Robert Tobias,1/1,1317686400,Pops perfectly in a microwave popping bowl,Like others have said. this stuff tastes great.  What I could find out is if it popped well in a microwave bowl like my <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BBAHV8>Fireworks Popcorn Microwave Popping Bowl and Gift Set.  Gift Box</a>.<br /><br />I emailed Great Northern Customer Service a couple times with that question and a request for a sample if the didn't know so I could try it.  They never responded and I took a chance and ordered some.<br /><br />This time taking a chance paid off.  It pops great and tastes great too.<br /><br />My only issue is the 4-ounce pack overflows my popcorn popping bowl.  My next order will be for their 2.5 oz packs.<br /><br />Bottom line: regardless of the size. this stuff tastes tons better than any other popcorn I've tried and works great in a microwave popping bowl.
29660,B000PDY3P0,A1UDF2QA5DKDFB,Susan W SW,1/1,1295654400,Best popcorn. best price by subscription,I ordered this initially just to try something less expensive than the whirly pop brands. I was really glad I did and I will continue to buy it. Everyone loves it and it is the perfect thing for the whirly pop popper. Buying it on subscription is the best way to go - decreases the price and eliminates shipping charges. This is a keeper.
29668,B0001GUQ20,A19DEWGOWSWL03,Don Chambers,5/5,1149897600,The best beef broth,Positively the best beef broth I have tried.<br /><br />Not too much salt. great flavor.
29685,B00995MODI,A1APASZIET1DMA,Bob Jennings Bob,0/0,1347321600,Great caramel,We really like this caramel.Sightly lighter than others. it doesn't get hard when poured over ice cream. Also gluten free which is good for the wife. Just a real good flavor and texture.

I am a real tea drinker. and I love this tea.  It is really like having a warm cup of vanilla cake.  It is a great way to start off your day!  Amazon does a great job delivering it right to my front door.
29714,B000GFYRIA,A1YDCC3EMT8ADZ,P. Lawson,1/1,1265328000,A Great Tea at a Great Price,I love this tea. If you are a tea drinker and haven't tried it. please do so. This tea is hard to find where I live in the South. Very good price when ordered like this from Amazon.
29730,B000GFYRIA,A11NOXIBYIZKDM,pondscum,0/0,1324339200,tasty dessert tea,I recently did a taste test against the Lipton caramel flavor.  The Bigelow's definitely the winner for me!  I know some people don't like dessert teas. but this is one of the better ones.

Just a fact with ANY caramel.<br />especially ones that use REAL butter and cream.  It says TOFFEE.  but in USA it's caramel.<br />Those who have said......oh it's hard. can't bite it........ three little words........<br />SIT ON IT!<br />I put  one piece in a zip lock bag...... and put it in my chair before I sit down.<br />Just forget about it!  When you wonder what is that under  there<br />you'll find the caramel is starting to soften.........this may  take  awhile. depending<br />on your body temp.  :  ) .....Just unwrap ........ and give a tug on a corner n'  s  t  r  e  c  h !<br />The Brazil nuts are high quality.  LOTS of nuts  and  full  of  flavor.<br />SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF TIME/WORK ........ BUT IF YOU LOVE SOFT CREAMY CARAMEL...........IT'S WORTH IT!<br />And the tray has many uses......wrap each piece  in cute cello bags (Dollar Tree)... there you have a gift!<br />Don't be fooled by the ridiculously low price..........WALKER'S IS A HIGHLY REGARDED BRAND IN ENGLAND/SCOTLAND/IRELAND.<br />FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS!  (may I have some right now?)
29744,B000VZSNS0,A3JEJG4D99OCRO,Annie Annie,4/9,1227830400,Very Stale,When a product is past its best by date. that fact should be revealed so we can decide whether to risk it.  These were stale. hard. inedible caramels.
29753,B000X98Z5A,A1L1Q5L04NKJY9,Luvs2Cook,7/7,1242000000,My dogs love the Greenies. and I like Amazon's price...,I am an enabler.  My two dogs have an insatiable addiction to Greenies.  Every night around 8:45 p.m.. they start whining. barking. and circling me... and they don't stop until they each get a Greenie for the day.  If you're a consistent buyer of Greenies like me. you know that it can get very expensive-- at the local chain pet store I can expect to pay $17.99 per bag of Greenies (12 oz.. 43 teenie pieces).<br /><br />Which leads me to review Amazon's performance in delivering these doggie treats at a reasonable price; currently it's $15.99 per bag and if you buy 3 bag you get one for free.  In addition to this. there's free shipping which saves me time and a needless trip down to the pet store.  If you buy 4 bags. you're getting it for about $12 per bag. which is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />In terms of the snacks themselves. the senior version of these Teenie Greenies are great-- they taste just as great as the original (based on my dogs' ability to consume it in under 3 minutes) but they have a softer consistency.  One of my dogs is nearly 18 years old. while the other is 9 years old... so dental care and not stressing out their teeth is really important to me.<br /><br />As long as Amazon maintains this deal. I'll continue to purchase the item directly from them.
29781,B000GFYRIK,AVOQXTF0A9YDF,johann rizzo,0/0,1331596800,Bigelow tea,Purchased this product for my son.  He likes t.he cinnamon flavor which is his favorite tea.  Bigelow has quality products and enough different teas to please any palate.

29796,B000GFYRIU,A38K7NW5HCVV32,R. Young,1/1,1302825600,The Mainstay of My Day,Every day. whatever the season. I have to have my pot of Plantation Mint tea.  Finding it had become a problem. though.  The one store that sells it for $2.19 a box seldom has it on the shelf. and the other store that carries it regularly sells it for $2.99 a box!  Living in a rural area (a national forest. actually) a long ways from the nearest large town that has more than the two groceries in the closest small town. I've had to depend on just these two stores. getting frustrated with either not finding the tea or paying an exorbitant price.  BUT. now that I've found it here and can have it delivered at regular intervals. no shipping charges. and at a savings over the store prices. I'm ecstatic.  No more running from store to store and hoping. no more getting strange looks when I stand in the coffee/tea aisle and cuss because the shelf is empty. no more wondering what I'm going to drink to feel good when the Bigelow box is empty.  My favorite tea now comes right to my mailbox. reasonably priced and automatically...like magic!  Life is good!
29797,B000GFYRIU,AVE9KNJYJDESB,W. Doug Bolden book addicted librarian,1/1,1161734400,Favorite Mint/Black Tea Combination,I do not have much experience with Bigelow outside of their Earl Grey (of which I generally choose Twinings). but I do love their Plantation Mint. I general keep at least half a box of it around at all times. because it is a wonderfully flavored tea that my friends enjoy and it is something they will drink no matter what particular blend I might be brewing for myself.<br /><br />With a little bit of honey. it makes a nice medium bodied tea for a cold night whose mint helps to open the sinuses and the soothe the throat. Cooled with ice in a tea glass. it is an extra refreshing drink that fits right in on a summer day. It is this versatality that demonstrates how well this blend is balanced. It tends to stay away from bitterness even on over steeping. so it is easier to adjust to a strength you like without having to resort to milk to round the edges.<br /><br />And. to better justify buying it the Amazon six-pack. it has a good long shelf life and it keeps its flavor strong for a couple of years.
29828,B001E6EE92,A1EWCJWX1GB9RS,Robert C. Hall,0/0,1312761600,Good and good for you.,There was a commercial that advertised its product as good and good for you.  Oatmeal Crisp fits that description. High cholesterol is one of my life ills and oatmeal is supposed to be a good tool against it. but I just can't imagine eating a bowl of cooked oatmeal everyday especially during the summer heat in Chicago.  Oatmeal Crisp on the other hand served with cold milk is a crunchy. sweet taste treat.  It holds up well in milk (soggy cereal makes me gag) and the almond slivers are a perfect touch.  Unfortunately. I have had difficulty finding this cereal on store shelves in my area. but Amazon has proven an adequate fix.  6 boxes at a time are a bit much. but I realize too much of a good thing is better than none at all and I place the additional boxes in the freezer.
29832,B001E6EE92,A24KF1N01YHVR4,Connecticut Fan Bart,1/2,1278460800,Glad they're available!,Our local supermarket stopped carrying this variety of cereal. Glad Amazon has them on the subscribe program. They're not only available when I need them. but they are significantly less costly than when purchased at the store.<br /><br />I always wait too long to reorder - I use them up before the next shipment is due - but Amazon respoonds quickly and within a week my stock is replenished. I have become a big fan of subscribe and save!
29834,B001E6EE92,A38QZSEWS9BG1D,ibelieve,1/2,1252627200,My husband's favorite cereal,I can only find this cereal (w/ almonds) at our local ACME grocery store. but it is more expensive.  So purchasing from Amazon.com was a no-brainer.  The expiration date is far enough along that my husband finishes the cereal beforehand.  He loves the crispiness of the cereal; so. as long as he wants Oatmeal Crisp w/ almonds I'll keep purchasing from Amazon.com.

Good Job NOW!
29840,B000F9XBJ8,A33DKGANHQJSXC,Anastasia Stasia,0/0,1245715200,Very different than the original,But VERY delicious just the same. If you're looking for a wee bit of a different flavor in the old favorite Oreo -- this is just what you're looking for! LOVE the size of the mini's too.

That was until I first tasted it.  This stuff is awful.  I powered on after first taste and received no energy boost from this mix.  I will not use again.
29888,B005VOOQLO,ALNTW7AUKUNML,smiles711,0/1,1332374400,Love it!,Green Thunder is great. Energy drinks like Red Bull or Monster really aren't the greatest in thge health department. Being an active middle school kid. I know you really need a little pick-me-up some days. I keep a bottle in my bookbag when I need it.<br /><br />As for the taste. its not to bad. It kind of tastes like monster. Its got green apple hints and tastes a little like punch. I like it enough to drink it again. :)
29891,B005VOOQLO,AILPRHAFPKLB1,D. Ellis,1/3,1330473600,Terrible Taste,The taste is horrible. and the boost in energy was not worth adding more of it to my drink. For now. I'll be sticking with 5-hr energy.

29902,B000WHPNI0,A3NF5J6DYJ5SRL,The Lady,2/3,1211932800,Good deal!,This is the only oil we use now.  And. the darker the olive oil. the more expensive it is.  So. we're happy to have this on regular delivery.  We won't have to make any special trips to pick up more.
29922,B001EQ5F9K,A3ONP7D1T1XP3N,KM,0/0,1308614400,Favorite Cereal Ever,I love this cereal so much. it is my favorite right now. It's the perfect amount of cinnamon. sugar and grain. While others have a problem with the sugar content. that's what I love so much about it. there's sugar crystals in this cereal that other cereals don't have. Yeah it does get soggy pretty fast. but that's not really a bad thing because it tastes great either way you go!
29927,B001EQ5F9K,A11M75UD20CX7V,Darcy A. Ianni,0/0,1294531200,Favorite Cereal,I love Cinnamon Life and this was a really great deal - especially when you sign up for the Subscribe and Save.  Love it!!
29933,B001EQ5F9K,A155EX606XWQCW,JD,3/10,1294963200,Don't be fooled by the price!!!!!,Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true. it probably is NOT a good deal.
29950,B001I8EVZI,A2WNSYMC9VQ0J5,kevin,0/0,1316044800,great deal,This is a great way to buy coffee especially when the local grocery stores are of no help to the consumer.

29963,B001P2490E,A3LDKPBIJTKCVD,Captain Awesome sam,1/1,1280880000,healthy salt??,So after reading a blog from sunfoods i decided that i was going to try himalayan pink salt.  my husband's blood pressure has been a little high in the past few years. so i've had to cook with as little traditional salt as possible.  The good thing about this salt is 1.) it's not toxic to your body like regular tablesalt. and 2.) it has a much bolder flavor. so you end up using way less than your used to. but still achieving a great flavor in each dish.  I cook meals from scratch every day and i know this salt is going to last me a while. so i believe it's a great deal.
29964,B001P2490E,A1JFNZ4UAMEZN3,Joe496 kittybaby,0/0,1320019200,I do believe this is the,best tasting salt I have ever tried.  The mineral content makes it pink in color and also adds to the wonderful flavor.  I consider this one of my better purchases.  I use it in my Cuisinart salt grinder.  Absolutely wonderful salt.
29971,B005W146CU,A1TDHURLE0EPA8,Writeright,1/1,1338422400,Worst cup of coffee I've ever had,I've really enjoyed every Starbucks Via variety I've tried -- the Italian and Colombian roasts. caramel and iced coffees especially. However. I've been hoping for a more mild blend since Starbucks can be a little too strong at times. So I was really excited to try this Breakfast Blend via. which is labeled as mild. Sadly. it's anything but. It's not only still strong. but also bitter. and leaves an awful sour aftertaste. I can't bring myself to drink another cup. even if it means a waste of money. Horrible.
29992,B000DZFMEQ,A1ASH1LE6HZ3Y3,Linda M. Walker,1/1,1256947200,Dated,I purchased a case of this bread mix because my daughter has celiac and I find it so hard to find products at a reasonable price. I have made 3 out of the 6 packages and only 1 turned out.  There is no date on the yeast packet so on the last one I finally decided to use my own yeast and that did rise properly.  My packs are dated May 22. 2010 but like I said the yeast has no date on it like other products I have bought.  My bar code is 93709 30060.  So needless to say when I thought I was saving money it actually cost me just the same price as when I show at the store.  I will continue to look for products on the website.  Thank you for letting me vent a bit.

30080,B000DZFMEQ,A2PIH1T5NW71AI,Carrie A. Hodges my5walnuts,0/0,1246233600,Great mix,I use this mix in the bread machine when I don't have time to put together a homemade batch.  It makes a good white bread batch that the kids all eat.
30093,B000DZFMEQ,APCDN1JK6B81P,Maneki Neko M.N.,81/88,1194480000,Good texture. flat flavor,I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix. and although it had many good qualities. I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot. and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy. soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me. but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it. expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me. and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time. but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture. similarly to bean flour. if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice. tapioca. etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix. like Bette Hagman's four flour blend. which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free). but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough. I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside. if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine. I would recommend that you try this mix. because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends. Bob's red Mill GF bread. or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread. but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon. So. while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item.
30110,B000DZFMEQ,A2UR6DN0RMUWSI,ducksinarow,0/0,1238112000,pizza and bread are okay. DO NOT make the pie crust recipe,This would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if the manufacturer hadn't caused me major frustration today with one of the recipes on the bag.<br /><br />The bread made from this mix is okay. not REAL bread but close as one can get without wheat.<br /><br />Pizza crust was fine too.<br /><br />I used it to make pie crust. following the recipe on the bag.  What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan. kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.  Tastes okay but very frustrating to make.<br /><br />Also. the recipe is for a tart crust. not a pie crust as that it insists you use butter.  Makes the crust REALLY rich. even substituting half shortening as the allows.

After trying other mixes. we finally had the GOOD fortune to try Pamela's.<br /><br />It is easy to make in our bread machine and is the BEST we have tried when considering both taste and texture.<br /><br />Try it. you're sure to like it !!!!
30150,B000DZFMEQ,A2QJBDP1NRXKX9,Linda Davis,0/0,1213488000,Better than store bought!,We have tried several gluten free packaged bread and bread mixes. All the packaged breads taste like cardboard-this mix actually has the consistency of sandwich bread. We use it for sandwiches and to make garlic bread when we have gluten free spaghetti(brush melted butter with garlic powder on one side at a time and brown in a frying pan).
30159,B000DZFMEQ,A3DORR6HG6OL4W,Amber Livingston,0/0,1208217600,Tasty mix!,We have really enjoyed this mix!  Very tasty bread.  The baking mix by Pamela's is also amazing for pancakes!

30174,B000DZFMEQ,A3NVDJTQSAMBYU,CAK,0/0,1198368000,The Best Bread,WOW......wheat and gluten free bread that actually tastes delicious.  Now that's a break through.  Thank you Pamela's.
30179,B000DZFMEQ,A1IDJJNXXN7ZOP,traceyo,0/0,1197676800,Yum!,Yum.Yum!  Tried this product based upon the many positive reviews here; it creates a wonderful. delicious. moist. somewhat dense chewy loaf of bread in my machine.  Much. much better than store bought GF loaves that we've tried.  Satified even kids with sensory issues!  Am purchasing another case today!  Pancake mix wonderful. too!
30186,B000DZFMEQ,A3LJLLOV0KMKH9,C. Brenholt gf baker,0/0,1191628800,Cooking for 5,I love this mix because it is so simple to make and my kids love the taste.<br />We buy it by the case. We make two packages at a time and freeze one loaf (cut in two) while enjoying the other loaf. This cuts down on clean up and time in the kitchen.<br /><br />One tip... I cut preparation time in half by doing the following: I mix the yeast into the flour first. then I heat the liquids to 110 degrees before adding them. Once the mixing is complete. I place the loaf pans in a warm toaster oven. Rising is complete in about 30 minutes. Bake time only takes about 30 minutes this way. Delicious bread!
30205,B000DZFMEQ,A2XFI5LTQ311B0,S. Hurd mom on a mission,4/4,1318896000,Stomach upset,I have Celiac disease. and been on a GF diet for over a year.  I have not had problems with any GF foods. but each time I eat a slice of this bread. I get stomach upset.  I am not allergic to dairy or eggs.  Celiacs beware- there is something tainted in this mix.
30215,B000DZFMEQ,A29MI1KXIH2VI2,M. Danley wheat free,5/13,1187913600,Pamelas Wheat Free Amazing Bread Mix,I was a little disapointed with this product.  I am allergic to dairy and wheat.  When I looked at the ingreadents it did say say wheat free. but now where did it say that there may be some dairy.  When I got the package it said it may contain dairy.
30231,B000DZFMEQ,A143D94YDG2R5K,M. Weber,2/2,1213747200,Just ok,I thought this mix was ok....it was a little too sweet for my taste. but the texture was great. I prefer to make my own from scratch.
30233,B000DZFMEQ,A38ZTB9NDF9JDM,L. Etherton,2/2,1209340800,Great bread!,I used this in my Breadman machine on the rapid white cycle and it came out great.  It made a nicely shaped loaf. tasted good. and stayed soft.
30252,B000DZFMEQ,ADT7O1C83DE53,MiraWhit,1/1,1308441600,Makes a GREAT sandwich!!!,I've tried several gf bread mixes and Pamela's is my favorite so far.  It is decent on it own and absolutely amazing for sandwiches.  I like mine with fresh baked bread. ham. lettuce. tomato. avocado. mustard. salt and pepper.
30257,B000DZFMEQ,A3LRWC1H3EVG10,A. Mariel,1/1,1296950400,So far. very good!,Having only recently discovered my gluten intolerance. my experience with GF products is limited...BUT. one thing for sure. the bread substitutes in the freezer departments of most grocery stores don't do much for the taste buds.  In fact.  the whole experience can be compared to trying to chew sawdust. (No. I haven't tried Udi's at Whole Foods.)<br /><br />With that in mind. and after reading the reviews. I decided to try another option  and bought the Pamela's GF Bread and Pizza Mix.  What a difference.  Yes. is is a bit spongy. but that's not an issue with me. What is important to me is it has texture and flavor. I made it my bread machine on the dough setting and baked it in the oven following the package directions for oven baking.  It got very brown at 60 minutes (rather than the 70 the package suggests) so I took it out. Let it cool (almost) and when I tried it - WOW what a difference.<br /><br />As I said. I'm new at this but. I recommend it over ready made.  Next step will be to try and make my own from scratch - but. I'm not quite there yet.

30296,B005DDCKJ8,ARUNYO4N6B78K,L333H L333H,6/6,1132531200,These Bars Are Awesome!,These bars don't have all the preservatives and junk that is in many other brands. and the taste is great!  I grab them whenever I crave chocolate or am on the run.  I highly recommend them. especially for those watching their sugar and/or carb intake.
30302,B005DDCKJ8,A34B6EI7CDRDOV,Joyce,1/1,1329523200,think thin bars,Excellent product...delicious and good for you!!  The texture is great and I love the protein content.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

30314,B005DDCKJ8,A1QX4AWYRQT35W,J. Rosenberg,0/0,1339372800,Very Tasty,I like these bars. but would rank them second to the Think Thin peanut butter variety.  Those are great.  These are very good.  Both offer up a good amount of protein for people who need more in their diet. such as vegetarians.
30326,B005DDCKJ8,A2F8K8CY5MTJF8,Zelda Kahn,0/0,1329264000,Favorite Gluten Free Protien Bar I've  Found to Date,I've found protein supplementing a necessity having a diet of pretty much only veggies and fruit [and candy]. I devastated when I found out that I needed to go gluten free because it pretty much cut out any protein bar I could stand eating every day.<br /><br />Then I found these.<br /><br />These taste great and have the protein I need. Their texture is a bit chewy. but still in the range of a yummy bar. I guess I just miss having a crunch in my diet [note: they're crunch bars are great. but they have a little too much fiber for my digestive system]. I've got to say. these certainly don't taste like white chocolate. but they are delicious. I think the branding in this company just decided to call this bar white chocolate. because thinkthin has another chocolate flavor and this one has a more complex flavor symphony working for it that would deter from the title of simply chocolate.<br /><br />I do wish they had a little more nutritional value in them. but I shouldn't ask for too much when flavor is more of my concern in a protein bar. They've got a little calcium and iron. so I'm happy. Especially when I compare their 230 calories to my old bar of 320 that had the same amount of protein [and a lot more nutritional content].<br /><br />These are also quite affordable when you buy the case [compared to the other gluten-free bars.]. I've been eating a least one a day and slowly over the past 10 months I've watched my lanky muscles grow into what they should be as a daily biker and intense artist who's apt to throw their whole body in their work.
30336,B005DDCKJ8,AE7V24950X647,Kathleen B. RAFFOUL,0/0,1316044800,Protein Bars,These protein bars are delicious and satisfy my craving for sweets. which I should not have.  This white chocolate is my favorite flavor. It keeps me from eating much higher calorie sweets like cheesecake.
30353,B005DDCKJ8,A2SM6QHCYK4N99,Amanda Boyce,0/0,1300924800,Not the best,There is something about this protein bar that does not sit well with me. I think its the white chocolate. I know its not real white chocolate but it still doesn't appeal to me. I tried it on a whim while traveling and probably won't have it again. I'm more of a fan of the peanut butter variety. However my friend really enjoyed this one.
30363,B005DDCKJ8,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,C. F. Hill CFH,0/0,1285545600,Good Tasting. Diabetic Friendly - Recommended,These thinkThin Brownie Crunch Bars are very filling and are good tasting (for diet bars). but those expecting a Little Debbie brownie will be greatly disappointed. Being a Type 2 diabetic. I am glad that these products are available since they only have about 11 NET Carbs.<br /><br />I find that they make a good breakfast or mid-afternoon snack. keeping me from eating something much worse.<br /><br />These do contain Maltitol and can cause gastric distress in some people. so it is a good idea to make sure you know how it effects you before heading out to the weekly Book Club meeting.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
30374,B005DDCKJ8,A1KE7VI1CU9B67,reviewer,1/2,1286496000,Worst protein bar ever tasted!,Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin.  Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life.  At least other brands try to make their bar taste alright. thinkthin basically said nope. not even going to try.  The bar barely has any white chocolate taste to it.  The bar is bitter and dry.  It took me 30 minutes to finish 1 bar because it tasted so bad.  Will never buy another thinkthin product.
30375,B005DDCKJ8,A1SF8LUO1J0Z8O,8728111,2/4,1286064000,BEST BARS EVER. BUT....................,These are the BEST BARS I HAVE EVER EATEN. I have one and my daughter has one EVERY day.<br /><br />And I shop on the internet whenever possible. so its not like I have something against Amazon. other online sellers. or UPS.<br /><br />But buy these bars at the store. The wonderful white chocolate covering on them melts when delivered by UPS. and although you can still eat it that ruins the bar. with chips of re-hardened white chocolate falling off every where.<br /><br />So BUY THESE BARS!!!!!THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. but buy them at the store.<br /><br />Apologies to Amazon. online sellers and UPS. but it is what it is................

Most of them are 3/4 pound or less at this price. This is a full pound of lightly flavored (vanilla. nutmeg. cinnammon) medium roasted coffee. I'm using it in my single-cup brewer and it yeilds a very smooth. non-bitter. light cup of coffee. I havn't tried using it in the 10-cup drip machine but most coffees are just a little stronger done that way.

I happened to double check with the original website.  I almost ordered this from this seller through Amazon.<br /><br />This tea from Harney is 5 star. but this seller is 1 star.
30434,B000X95SYQ,A9ZYJJG0S87XN,Katy,1/1,1340064000,absolutely the best,I am so glad that Amazon carries this in Prime now. We've been buying from petsmart which is both expensive and inconvenient. I really hope that let me subscribe and save at some point in the future!<br /><br />Regarding the product. this really is the best cat food. My cats' coats are beautifully soft and shiny. they have a good level of energy. and I honestly think it helps with shedding.  We recently adopted a second cat. who was being fed purina pro-plan. his coat was gritty and he shed like crazy. he was slightly overweight and kind of sluggish.  after about a month of avoderm. his coat became as soft as our other cat. lost the gritty texture. he lost the weight and has enough energy to keep up with his new friend. the kitties are healthy and happy - i won't feed them anything else.<br /><br />also. i concur with the other review about the salmon flavor. my cats didn't really care for it either.

30458,B001KUULIK,A1HAMJNZ7R2XVA,RobinD,3/3,1340668800,Buyer Beware,I've used this flour for nearly 20 years.  It's higher protein properties lend its self nicely to perfect bread baking.  However . . .read the product details carefully.  This is for an 80 ounce (5 lbs) bag of flour . . that's  seven times higher than the price at your local grocery store.  Furthermore. under item description. this product is listed as having a shipping weight of 41 pounds . . .so this seller is profiting on shipping by a LOT on top of the product its self.
30459,B001KUULIK,ASAG6OT6QZA5U,A. Ward,3/3,1300320000,Best Bread flour. Hands Down,I love to bake and I have to say that this the best bread flour I have ever used. I love that it is unbleached. and it gives a smooth texture to whatever your baking.I made homemade pizza last weekend using this flour and it made the best crust ever. chewy inside. crispy outside and no bleachy aftertaste.
30461,B001KUULIK,A2QAGD983KRLBY,tfb7716,2/2,1325116800,QUALITY BAKING,I have been using King Aarthur All-Purpose. Whole Wheat. White Whole Wheat as well as Bread Flours for several years ever since I discovered KA in a supermarket. Believe me it is well worth the extra pennies for a bag of these flours. I have used these flours mainly for bread (I could live on bread even though they say that man does not live by bread alone) as well as for cakes and cookies.  If you haven't tried KA I strongly advise you to start baking with it ASAP. I do not work for KA nor am I part of the company--just one of their loyal consumers.

The rose aroma is strong. like a grandmother's old fashioned perfume and the flavor matches it exactly. Americans are not used to eating floral flavors. even in Europe you only see violet as candy. so rose is very unusual to our palates but very delicious and exotic. I recommend people try it.

I have given them to many people. and they love them.  You must try them; what have you got to lose?
30528,B006WJHOX4,A2N7V6NY8ZXGMA,Jim Smith,1/1,1347494400,Not as fresh dated as I get at the Stores and made in Mexico,I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the Use By Date at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week. and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for February 2013. so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid-Sept 2012 now. so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also. the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek. Michigan - and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered. I think I will change to another brand and cancel my Subscribe and Save.

30571,B003NY9NDU,A2B1K7CPPBGO7F,RAM,3/4,1298419200,STRONG,THIS IS STRONG STUFF!!!!!!!!!  I mean really. I would really really advise against drinking even a small drop! The package it came in stank (in a good way) of peppermint so hard that I used it as an air freshener in my car for a week before the smell went away :D<br />Great for putting in my water when I work out to cool me down a bit. I highly recommend! The only issue on my part is it says alcohol(95%) on it? Weird. but I don't think its a big issue because it wont catch on fire (I tested just to make sure it. well you know. was not actually 95% alcohol) :)<br />Great buy
30583,B004538TME,A6MEH2AWU33YR,James E. Lee,14/14,1318032000,Great taste. too expensive,Love the great rich taste of Folgers Colombian Coffee. but the kcups and the packaging make it too expensive to continue to purchase. Skip all the expensive graphics and printing costs and just package it in plain kcups and save everyone the big cost and you sell more.
30591,B004538TME,AWSK1ZAEU1KFL,Dale in Tenn Dale,1/1,1332547200,Just Ok. Other Better Blends,I found this to be 'middle of the road' blend.  I was not expecting it to be more than that. hence the 4 stars.  There are other richer blends with a more full body taste that I prefer.  Note:  This is personal preference. not the fault of Folgers.  I have dropped the size of the brew on my Keurig and it has helped considerably.  Unfortunately. I often forget to do that at 6:00 am in the morning - not terrible coherent without that first. fresh cup !!!<br /><br />If you like a milder blend. try this.  The price is right and it is nice to keep different blends in the house for guests.
30592,B004538TME,A3VNUEWUVEYQ8F,Billy Fowler,1/1,1326067200,All these other brands and the name we know and trust is the best,I have tried several of the K-cups and none of them have the taste that Folgers has. They are either too strong. too bitter or just have a funny taste. Not that they all taste bad. just not what I have been looking for. I just want some good old fashion American tasting coffee and this is it. If you want coffee that is comparable to MacDonald coffee this is the closest I have found in the K-cup.
30605,B004538TME,A18TD63LUDC3P2,R. Holland Chatmandu,0/0,1347148800,Best of the K-cups,I find the Folgers Lively Colombian K-cup the be the best for a  medium roast and flavor.  Smooth after taste and just enough body to know your drinking a medium blend.
30623,B004538TME,A2I8D8737HCCGG,pastorbridges,0/0,1304640000,Great Coffee...,This is a great coffee. I have tried many. many kinds for my Kerug... this one is a nice balance of rich flavor. It's a great coffee for everyday... if you are looking for something that is good and not too expensive this is it.
30631,B0042DIZIU,AP5UHIWWM8TS7,Julie C. White jcwhitern,2/2,1345852800,Delicious and convenient,Ordered these for lunch box snacks.  Delicious. convenient. and stays fresher than buying a big bag and dividing them up.  Also about the same cost as dividing up the big bag.  Overall a great deal.
30642,B001GIETMA,A3HS3DWUZMWJRG,Carolyn Nilsson Carolyn,4/4,1229817600,Good texture. good chocolate,I've had these several times-they're very good brownies.  They have a good texture (gluten free can mean gritty. but these are fine).  They're very chocolaty. not overly sweet.
30646,B001GIETMA,A1OR9EQTUQFVHP,C. Fuller foolish scholar,0/0,1234742400,Moist & Delicious!!!,These WOW Gluten Free Brownies are exquisitely delicious. They are at least as good as brownies made from wheat products. if not better. They are moist and chocolaty. There is no sour or flat taste that is common with many gluten free baked goods. Because there is no gluten there is a lack of chewiness that is common to some fudge brownies. but the moist mouthwatering taste is unsurpassed.<br /><br />I have given these gluten free brownies to people who are not gluten intolerant and they wanted more. WOW knows how to bake!<br /><br />The one caveat. if you are lactose intolerant. is that WOW uses butter as an ingredient. If a dozen are ordered. I would also recommend putting some in the freezer. It helps dissuade from eating all of them at once and keeps them around longer. These are absolutely finger lickin' good!
30674,B001BCVE5G,A1TXAWGZ42JQOP,A West,0/0,1342224000,Dented cans ruined the product,E-V-E-R-Y can was dented. Some had to be thrown out. as they were so badly dented we couldn't tell if they were spoiled or not. I would like to have known in advance that these were factory seconds so I could choose whether or not I wanted to risk it.  Great refried beans though--our favorite brand.
30684,B000EYRBSQ,A31ZOZWAIQ6YWT,Agent 609,3/4,1283472000,Not good for a toddler,They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other brands of dried apples - crispy. but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler. but the pieces are big. hard. and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.<br /><br />On the bright side - they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself. they should work.
30688,B000EYRBSQ,A1I7N3LJNWCVR1,Jo Kang,0/0,1333065600,Tastiest and most sensible snack for toddlers...,Apple Crisps were my original pick until I noticed that they were made/imported from Asia. I normally veer away from packaged foods with long expiration dates. so Apple Harvest was my most sensible. natural choice. They definitely taste better than Apple Crisps and even my young kids like them better.
30697,B000EYRBSQ,A19FLSFHX7B5XY,BIG MAMA,0/0,1175472000,TASTY QUICK SNACK,THESE APPLE CHIPS ARE DELICIOUS.  I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE CRUNCH.  IN A HURRY???....JUST GRAB A BAG AND GO.  CAN'T GET ANY EASIER THAN THAT.
30713,B007M83302,A37L02WUJKP8QK,D. Hendren Grammy02456710,1/1,1279497600,Super Yummy,I love these chips! They are lower in fat but better in taste that most other chips. The price is right too at the case price.
30736,B007M83302,A1PZO2HQFTLHC7,Mary L. Runnion,1/1,1269043200,Pop Chips Original Chips,These are the best chips I have eaten. They are popped instead of fried or baked which makes them easier on the weight column.<br /><br />Love them. love them.
30747,B007M83302,ARWIOUASZIL1X,Michele,1/1,1260316800,Love them!,These are the best chips ever!  The BBQ ones are on the spicy side. which I really like.  I used to think baked chips were good until I tried Pop Chips.  There is no comparison!  The baked chips are thin. flat and tasteless next to these.  If you want a chip you can really sink your teeth into you will not be disappointed!
30749,B007M83302,A335ZX9N3UWHX4,C. Rhodes NewLadyinFl,1/1,1254096000,DELICIOUS and ADDICTIVE,Everyone who tries them ends up eating the entire bag.  We ordered two cases of 12 in bbq and garlic parm and they were gone in two weeks.  Between guests and midnite snacking there are two garlic parms left.  Ordering more today!
30754,B007M83302,ANDLI8KLNE2DK,Shannon what it takes,1/1,1243900800,My husband takes them to work every day,After my husband tried these chips (BBQ flavor) at a lunch meeting he couldn't stop talking about them.  We found them at a local grocery store - but they were on the expensive side.  Luckily we found them on Amazon at a much more reasonable price.  Thanks for carrying the brand.
30781,B007M83302,A22IEMCYCS128S,Pam McEachern,0/0,1346371200,Very good,These chips are tasty and meet the need I sometimes have for a treat.  Usually potato chips are off limits due to fat and salt.<br /><br />These fill the need for that treat.  The individual packages help limit the amount I eat and are very good.
30793,B007M83302,A30OFZJH3B3UEK,rake,0/0,1338076800,Yum,These chips are good. Not the best thing I've ever tasted. but pretty good. The first couple bites are confusing and strange but it gets better. They get really good after the first ten. I got my box of chips yesterday and I've already eaten two bags. They are yummy. Much better for you than regular chips. I don't feel guilty at all for eating so many. The bags are a little small though. I'm still debating on whether or not twelve small bags of chips are worth $25.
30804,B007M83302,A2YDU3RZB63VXW,P. Brand,45/52,1296000000,Holy SALT. Batman!,We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a healthier alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice. again - similar to a ricecake. but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their original flavor...I can't imagine what the Salt & Pepper style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor. I don't think you can call these a healthy alternative to chips.
30805,B007M83302,A1HLYNGUBXXW9S,Maureen in WA maureeng,16/17,1215561600,Excellent Chips!,These chips are really. really good.  I don't bother buying any other kind of potato chips.  These have a great taste and no messy greasy fingers.  I was shocked and disappointed to find out my local grocery suddenly stopped carrying the chips.  Thank goodness for Amazon. Now I can get the chips right to my door--cheaper than I was paying at the grocer!
30806,B007M83302,A1EE6LQS3OPY6R,DynomiteWins DynomiteWins,8/8,1327536000,Sweet Potato Popchip Goodness!,As a kid. I scarfed bags of the Calbee Sweet Potato chips that my mom would pick up at the local Asian market. As my tastes refined in adulthood. I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy. without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the Terra & Food Should Taste Good chips) which have all been good. but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes. oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy. sweet potato flavored. salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are. well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before. the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered. air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me. all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging. they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!
30863,B007M83302,A3K11Z15PE4IMW,MikeFox,0/0,1328659200,Crispy. tasty. wonderful!,These are just delicious. Better than the traditional chip and better for you too! I would recommend that everyone try them. I plan to order more flavors and more and more.
30865,B007M83302,A1B1QMGK8VYG80,Dan Seidman,0/0,1328572800,Pretty Good. VERY Healthy,Finally. someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor.<br /><br />If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil. top 3 being french fries. donuts and potato chips. Your body has a tough time breaking down the oil once it's fried.<br /><br />So the Popchips are an excellent option for potato chip lovers. (though I prefer the Chili Lime flavor over the Sweet Potato).
30883,B007M83302,ADVSW4W1HHYF7,scolvig,0/0,1327795200,So so,Normally I prefer plain chips. even though I don't eat them often. The chili lime is pretty good. great with some guacamole. These chips are very crisp. with a strong potato flavor. but also have a slightly burnt taste.
30890,B007M83302,A24N79JNVNFSBV,jhcpa,0/0,1327449600,Outstanding!,Put simply. these chips are full of flavor. texture and lower in calories than your average potato chip. They have a slightly salty but still sweet flavor. There's great crunch due to the fact that they have rice flour in them. They are not greasy since they are NOT fried. The only criticism is that they do not offer any significant fiber. being that the sweet potato is mixed with rice flour. I will absolutely purchase these as an alternative to a potato chip or a tortilla chip. for snacking.
30893,B007M83302,AJTT716I37Q6J,Carolyn Lattanzio,0/0,1324425600,Single Serve Pop Chips,It is so convenient receiving these single serve Pop Chips through the mail.  They stay fresh. and there is no waste or overdoing it.  One little bag is a decent portion of these tasty chips. and I've never seen this size in a store.
30901,B007M83302,A3AR4MDJNH4AOL,Dorrie,0/0,1319760000,Healthy Indulging,These cute little circles crunch and taste so. so. so good!  I always remind myself that I'm eating a low-fat. baked good-for-my-health snack or part of a meal because the truth is they're sinfully good.  I like them best when I just nibble at the edges and draw the experience out for as long as I can.  But they're good just chomped down. too.
30909,B007M83302,AWK8JFCJ72VGT,Careful Shopper Loris,0/0,1317513600,Makes you pucker. but tastes good.,I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips). but have to say. because they are a little tart. I don't seem to be eating them as quickly. (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar. you will like these.
30922,B007M83302,A2Y6KBLUNU7171,G. Williams eba89122,0/0,1317254400,This stuff should be illegal!,Forget heroin...  Forget cocaine...  Forget meth...  NOTHING is more addictive than these chips.  Heed these words: these chips will cause the downfall all modern civilization.<br /><br />In all seriousness. these things are very tasty. and nowhere near as bad for you as an old fashion potato chip.<br /><br />My wife picked up a small bag in an airport vending machine while on a trip.  She saved a few chips for me to try when she got home.  I was so impressed with the taste. and the nutrition label. that I immediately thought of my dad.  He loves a good snack item (don't we all?). but with a recent diabetes diagnosis. and the ever increasing challenge to lose a few pounds. his snacking options have been getting pretty sparse.<br /><br />So I shoot him a text message. and include a picture of the nutrition label from the back of the bag.  Seconds later I get a text message back:  Are you kidding?  We're the reason Pop-Chips stock doubled last quarter!  Put all your stock into BBQ Pop-Chips. They will replace crystal meth soon!<br /><br />Now. I haven't tried the other flavors yet.  If you look through the feedback on the other flavors. not all of them appear to be smash hits.  But you can't go wrong with Original.  Definitely give these things a try.  You won't be disappointed.
30944,B007M83302,A3GMF3G8MB8BQR,DSR music fan,0/0,1308614400,Delicious!,I love Pop Chips! I've only tried the regular ones so far. Enjoy getting them for less from Amazon with a subscription. Everyone I've shared them with has really enjoyed them. If you haven't tried them. you're missing out on a delicious. low fat and low calorie snack that tastes decadent.

30971,B007M83302,A2FEIY3K5MRNXF,sp2,0/0,1300406400,Pop Chips,I absolutely love Pop Chips.  They give me the crunch and flavor that I want and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat them!  Perfect portion size in the single serve bag.  I have tried 3 of the flavors (original. BBQ. and green onion) and the BBQ is the best yet.
30981,B007M83302,A16LMUR3AX8T2J,bag,0/0,1297900800,Yum,These are better than the Special K things. These actually taste like potato (because they are potato). I describe them as a mix between Munchos and O'Boises. Delicious.
30991,B007M83302,A1GS8K0TSHCX84,A. L'Heureux,0/0,1296432000,Popchips are amazing!,An entire bag of the 3-ounce Popchips are only 360 calories and are very low in fat. I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and. despite being produced very unlike traditional chips. the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly. I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw.
30999,B007M83302,A3KT5JU7RD4Q4O,Jin,0/0,1291766400,Great chip. little salty for me.,I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips. it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.
31004,B007M83302,A23R4JI2Q9CKDR,almost baby product expert,0/0,1290816000,Ok,I like that it's not greasy and has less calories. but it's a little salty side. and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure. but I don't think I will buy it again.
31101,B007M83302,A1HTC4BKKYA9VC,Diana A. Wang,0/0,1252713600,PoPchips,I have said it once and I will say it again..These are the BEST!!! I am so addicted to this it is not funny. Love the single serving bags and so far the orginal is my favorite..I have friends who love the BBQ ones and Salt & Vinegar but the orginal ones are my favorite:)<br />Thank you popchips!!!!
31112,B007M83302,A2JBZHQVQF7MV0,Sherry,0/0,1248220800,Addictive!,I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.
31125,B007M83302,A2TS39A4PLC2UQ,robsmom,0/0,1234224000,Robsmom,These popchips(original flavor)are great tasting. low in fat. and a snack that is satisfying. With free shipping and handling with amazon prime they are now at a price I will order and reorder.  With my son's food allergies I am so happy they contain all allowable ingredients!!  Thanks Amazon.

31135,B007M83302,AZBEOADXPY11W,Christabel,4/5,1328227200,THESE HAVE CHANGED....AND NOT FOR THE BETTER!,Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said. I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them. but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :(
31193,B007M83302,A30ELDPP5TCQ8J,Bernard Farrell,0/2,1327536000,WAY better than I expected,The label says they're popped. rather than fried or baked.  However they did it. these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them. though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag. 3 grams of fat (no saturated. no trans fat). 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes. but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.
31195,B007M83302,A2PL7D70ZQ22LU,P. Najarian,0/2,1214179200,Great chips,I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday. Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but. took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad. Amazon usually comes through.

These have been my salvation while dieting.  One serving practically fills an entire cereal bowl. but has way less fat and calories than traditional chips.  I'm hooked!  I highly recommend trying these!

31238,B007M83302,A231LBC8EGPO5L,OutlawPoet OutlawPoet,1/1,1327449600,Chili Lime Flavor - Review,In general. I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime. however. I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and. while not awful. this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however. they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors. I'm sure there will be folks that will love these. but for me. the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.
31262,B007M83302,A2X9PNKZRBD1UC,M. Henry,1/1,1300492800,A healthy alternative,These are a much healthy alternative to most chips and they taste great.  They have a great crunch and flavor and don't have that bad after taste that most baked chips have.  My only regret is that I didn't order more when they were on sale there all gone now but even at regular price are worth it.

If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I threw away the entire order (since I could not return I opened one package and made pancakes...they were so bad I tried to feed them to my dog but she would not eat them either). Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a much better product by ordering the REAL Atkins pancake and baking mix. which I will do next time! Do not be fooled by this company.

One of the moms had these in a few flavors and they were a hit. They mainly taste of the seasoning. and if someone gave you one blindfolded. you swear it was just some normal bit of chex-mix.<br /><br />I'd rather my kiddo was eating bugs with some nutrition. vs. the same amount of candy.<br /><br />I say give it a try. what the hey!
31309,B004V3INQ0,AP77SCQX6LNGW,Sheree Trimuel AllAboutMe,1/1,1323043200,Tea Please,Well upon reading reviews of how this taste like a chemical I was completely skeptical of buying this. How ever I really. really like ice tea so I thought let me give it a try. Shipping was fast and I was eager to try this. I was also tired of buying that starbuck's sweeten black tea lemonade. This is not sweetened so I added a little sugar in the glass with ice so that it would be easier to mix with the hot tea coming out and I was right! I like it. But there is one downfall.... I keep going to the restroom thanks a lot tea!
31322,B007RGLKR2,A1KB8EA3SAFPEH,S. Paola I Save More so I can Shop More,0/0,1338163200,Delicious!!!!!,I got a similar variety pack at Costco and every flavor was amazing.  Unfortunately they left me wanting MORE!  Much better tasting than other 100 calorie snacks especially if you are a chocolate lover!
31331,B000FDMMVM,A29EI69HM2IX65,Harry Ploss harry37p,3/3,1214438400,Tasty but breaks easily,I love the texture and flavor of this product.  It is not very strong and will easily break. if you put a lot of food on it.
31350,B0006NLWY4,A1WE8KTC20NY65,Denise,0/0,1330560000,Good - but too hard for small dogs,I have small dogs and one of these treats is far too large for them.  Plus the one smaller dog doesn't have the jaws to even break through these since they are too hard.  We broke some apart by banging on it with a the end of scissors and they seemed to really like the taste.  But they are too much work to purchase again. I am happy that they seemed to love a low fat treat - but if you have small dogs - you may want to get these instead:  <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9CH4S>Old Mother Hubbard Mother's Solutions Snacks for Dogs Soft and Chewy 5 Calorie. 6-Ounce Pouch</a>
31355,B00022VUAK,AVQ1NMPRENR08,C. Waters Gift Giver,1/1,1169078400,Excellent,This is a wonderful product. No sugar. no caffine. but a wonderful rich taste.
31358,B000I6RBE4,A2GP06TFJJ69D,cafecoffeelover,0/0,1334361600,Yummy extravagance,This is a great tasting but pricey coffee.  Love most of Coffee Masters flavors but this is a special favorite.
31373,B0006VB3TK,A2ECEIX9OOX6T7,Jaclyn Womack,4/4,1304553600,Not Everlasting. but Not Bad!,First: If you don't have the ball holder. don't bother with these. They aren't really everlasting in the ball. but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y>StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball. Large</a><br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed. this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer. is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out. the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog. get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it. which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are pretty neutral smelling. which is a plus for this line. I know dogs are all about the smell of things and the stinkier something is. the more they like them...but when you have to share the household with a dog. you need to find a happy medium. This is ours when company comes over. It has no real smell. but they aren't her favorite either.
31376,B0006VB3TK,A2T2ODGJCC3BM6,Rhaya S. Rhaya S.,3/3,1232323200,Great Toy!,I was looking for something that would keep my dog busy. but also wasn't food that he would just eat and be done with.  This treat. combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball is such a great solution.  My dog (about 60 lbs. Dalmation) has so much fun trying to get this out of the ball. and he seems to love the taste of the Vanilla Mint more than any others.  This takes him a while to eat. but also isn't a lot of food.  it's a pretty decent sized treat.  When I first got it. it took him a while to get the treat all the way out. even days!  Now he can do it in an hour so so. but I still think it's a great buy.<br /><br />Just make sure to get the right size for your dog! Too small and they will rip it apart.
31381,B0006VB3TK,A21NUPYA993V9E,Mercy,1/1,1218326400,Great dental treat,Our Chihuahua flies through these! They are great for encouraging use of both top and bottom front teeth rather than solely the back as with many bone-type dental chews.
31386,B0006VB3TK,A16DT7ITB59UGN,abbiepomeroy,0/0,1332633600,Keeps my doggies entertained!,Both of my chihuahua mutts love these inserts. I use the treat in a bendo ball for one and she's busy for hours! The other pooch doesnt like the bendo ball but loves this treat.  He eats it in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Def will stock up on these. Especially seeing as the dog that likes the treat in the ball is the more demanding of entertainment than the other - who is contented by just sitting next to me and snugglling.<br /><br />I just wish they were a bit less expensive. however. it's worth the price for a happy (ie. not bored) dog.
31396,B000E5C20W,A19QSNBFNXTG1V,Jake Morgan Shadow,6/6,1183248000,Beyond YUM!,I would consider this the best flavour of nerds. The coatings really bring out their inner flavour. and you'll want to be snacking on them all the time. which is why i ordered this 36 pack. I would suggest this to all snackers!
31402,B000E5C20W,A15I5RZ0SADN9Y,Maxwell Mudd,1/4,1304208000,Tastes great. but contains bugs,Yeah. Nerds have always had a great taste. but I don't understand why the Wonka company continues to use Carmine color in their products. Carmine color. which is listed in the ingredients above. is made from the ground up bodies of the cochineal insect. So until Wonka learns that they don't need to use ground up bugs to color their candy red. I'm not buying.
31406,B002RSYTQO,A3QH7YVTWAX49O,Robert,1/1,1342224000,It Doesn't Get Any Better!,I bought a bottle of Blackberry Balsamic Vinegar last fall at a county fair. and since it is now running low. I attempted to find the brand that I had purchased at the fair. but to no avail.  When I found the Blackberry Ginger Balsamic Vinegar at Amazon. I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is as good as. if not better than. the old stuff.  I will definitely reorder!
31407,B002RSYTQO,A3IYBNFT06J50,Denise C.,0/0,1343260800,The Best Balsamic On Earth,I bought this product on a whim (I don't remember where) and fell in love with it. It is absolutely the best balsamic vinegar I've ever had. I use it on salads. vegetables. as a dipping sauce with olive oil. just about anything you can think of. It has a thicker consistency that most other balsamics and a very unique taste. With the closing of  Tavern on the Green. I was worried I would not be able to find it. Now that I've found it. I plan to order more!
31411,B00016JH5M,AXG7R063Y28H9,tar5f,0/0,1340582400,should be called candied strawberries,I wantd to make the Barefoot Contessa's recipe for strawberry scones. which calls for dried strawberries.  Expecting to get something akin to dried cranberries or raisins. I was disappointed. these should be called candied strawberries since they hardly resembled fruit and were coated in sugar.  They were OK in the recipe. but I can't feel good about feeding these to my family.  Save your money (they are pricey!)and use craisins instead - or just go for chocolate.
31416,B008N04REE,A10IUTMPZ5B95S,Jamikers,1/1,1344124800,So good!!!,Had the pleasure of trying this while visiting my parents back east. It is really really good! Not too salty and just plain tasty!! I was bummed to realize I couldn't purchase it around Seattle so I had to order some! Once you try this I know you will be hooked and at 35 calories a cup. it's a pretty safe addiction :-) Enjoy!!
31420,B001O8KIWC,A2EMCL2FO637Q2,Mary A. Simmons,8/8,1132272000,Makes Everything Taste Great,This seasoning is good on all meats and vegetables. I ran out a couple of months ago and nothing I cooked tasted the same. You must try it.
31435,B001O8KIWC,A1KB5EO23DQNM8,michael macdonald,0/0,1331424000,The BEST seasoning. period,Spike brings a fresh. natural pop! to everything from salad to eggs. steak to potatoes.  Reading the list of ingredients will convince you. Spike is a blend of natural. not laboratory. ingredients. that is a 'Must Have' in my kitchen.  Spike is my absolute favorite seasoning. bar none.
31439,B001O8KIWC,A3BG29HSWFAXAX,horrorguy300,0/0,1306195200,Best seasoning out there!!!,Spike is my secret weapon in the kitchen.  I've been using this for 30 years. I used to have to go to the health food stores and it is harder and harder to find.  Thank goodness for Amazon. You can find anything here!!!
31444,B00016UX00,A2SPVQNKOW9YNN,Douglas Schifter food maestro,0/0,1346371200,Ripoff,I paid 2.99 a fifteen ounce jar or roughly 9 bucks for three.  Grossly overpriced here. Avoid this ripoff and look for cheaper. Also when measured out this fifteen ounce was barely more than an eight ounce cup. The fifteen ounces are not by liquid measure but by actual weight.&128078;
31446,B001E5DXEU,A3L7X863SITMMY,A. Hlathein,0/0,1273276800,Delicious,This Chai is so good.  It reminds me of powdered hot cocoa but I could also see paying 4.00 for something just like this in a coffee house!!  I love the flavor - it is a mild chai flavor.  Even though I watch my calories. I try to fit in one drink a day.  The value on amazon is outstanding!  I am on subscription and can tell I will need to move it up to a more frequent delivery increment!
31455,B001E5DXEU,A12A4JV3I7SHM,J. McDonald,0/0,1258416000,Big Train Chai,This tastes much better than the warm milk you get from the various coffee houses like Starbucks.
31459,B001E5DXEU,A1E3L0MZ58MNWQ,Duderino,0/0,1254873600,Tasty - better as an additive,Since this product is quite sugary. I use it for my coffee which not only makes the coffee taste better but I am using less than a scoop every time so it helps conserve.<br /><br />The taste is smooth. creamy with a little kick.<br /><br />Also. it comes with a scooper.<br /><br />I will buy more of this when I run out.
31477,B001E5DXEU,A2YVIQ4L99X00,Spanish Sarah soy latte mama,0/1,1252713600,Best Chai Ever!,My local coffee shop has me addicted to their 20 oz vanilla chai lattes. At $3.90 a pop I was spending a lot of money.  I asked what brand they used. need nutritional information. of course!  They told me it was Big Train Chai Vanilla.<br />It's important to follow the directions on the can.  I made mine with just milk with a yucky result.  Use the water with a little milk as there is milk powder in the mix.<br /><br />WARNING:It's addicting!!!
31480,B001E5DXEU,AXOFRZP2BX6WC,M. Park,9/9,1240531200,Absolutely the best chai tea I've found,After discovering chai tea a few years ago. I have since been hooked.  I have tried several coffee shop versions as well as a couple store bought varieties as well and can easily say this is my favorite chai tea.  The taste reminds me of that of a cinnamon roll with a very rich. smooth flavor.  Most other chai teas taste more like gingerbread to me. which while enjoyable. not my cup of tea.  ;)  My only minor complaint would be that I usually end up with small amount of pulp in the last sip.  I'm not sure if this is due to the water not being hot enough but it's not enough to keep me from loving this product.
31486,B001E5DXEU,A1DFEYQ0QS8EZF,Jennifer M. Mccarrick,2/2,1258329600,Vanilla Chai,It's such a delicious treat! But don't put as much powder as the directions tell you to. You should use only about 1/2 of what's instructed or it's way to sweetand strong. It also won't desolve completely. But it really is wonderful once you get the correct measurements for your own taste!
31488,B001E5DXEU,A1O2KO9069FHUU,L. Landrum,1/1,1328486400,It WAS my favorite...,I have been ordering Big Train Vanilla and Spiced Chai for just over 2 years on Amazon's subscription.  It was so good and it rivaled the chai at my favorite coffee house (NOT Char-bucks).  I always LOVED it. and enjoyed a cup each morning as I braced for the coming day.  I did. that is. up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe. but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher. so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.<br /><br />The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai. so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately. I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening. I have reduced the amount I use even more.  That horrible flavor is still there. so I know it isn't related to the way it's mixed.<br /><br />I am very disappointed because. like I said. it was my favorite beverage in the morning.  After trying so many different things over the last 4 months. I have finally selected another brand to try out.  I hope it is as good as this one used to be.
31495,B001E5DXEU,A22X1GVRYXYOGT,Sherrie,0/0,1351036800,Chai Latte,This is a great tasting Chai Latte.  The price is much better than purchasing the smaller cans in the local stores.  I do however.... wish they would make one that is sugar and/or fat free.
31507,B001E5DXEU,A3DYZJQJX1B6IY,Heather Gonzalez,0/0,1342396800,YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!,This is the best vanilla chai you will ever have. we mix it up with milk and pour it over ice in the summer and have it warm like hot chocolate in the winter. absolutely perfect. the coffee shop down the street charges $4.50 for an iced vanilla chai made with this same mix. i'm saving a ton of money making it myself.
31520,B001E5DXEU,A2J973VOBCPI46,M. E. Vande Woude,0/0,1330992000,too much buzz,I started reading the reviews to find out if there is caffeine in the Vega Chai Vanilla.  Low and behold 65 mg per serving.  If you are sensitive to caffeine. beware.  I have yet to sleep and it is 3 am!
31531,B001E5DXEU,A1FSDIIWLUMD5A,avid reader avid reader,0/0,1325462400,Best chai tea by far bar none!!,Been drinking this for years now. even my sons (who are neither tea nor coffee drinkers both enjoy this as well. Great flavor. always fresh. Love the vanilla. Tried many around the world through the last 10 years. this is the BEST by far.
31554,B001E5DXEU,A32RB85B78ZISX,SignedNikki,0/0,1302566400,Amazingly Addictive!!!,My cousin has been drinking the Spiced Chai Tea for months now and it's pretty tastey. but I wanted to try the Vanilla because I prefer a smoother tasting tea. And let me just say... I am sooo happy that I decided to purchase the Vanilla Chai Tea. It's delicious with warm water. but if you want a creamier taste try it with milk. When I was developing a slight cold I mixed one scoop of the tea. 7oz. of hot water. 1 tsp of honey. and 1.5oz of Remy Martin 1738 Cognac and it was heaven in a coffee mug :o). I can honestly say that I am addicted to this stuff and I'm not ashamed to admit it. If your a Calorie Counter. BEWARE of this tea - it's hard to have just one cup a day!1!
31558,B001E5DXEU,A2ZM05SQWFUZSE,alvida,0/0,1298160000,Best Tea EVER!!!,This is the best Chai Tea available! So much better than spending WAY too much money on mediocre chai tea at a Starbucks. etc. And you can enjoy a cup any time of the day! Have gotten lots of people hooked on it and even have Tea time at work! Enjoy!
31567,B001E5DXEU,A2NFR57ZSW0PZE,Susanna Standish Hautemamasuz,0/0,1283385600,Mmmm...mm...GOOD!,It's official. I'm addicted to Big Train Chai!!! I know every coffee stand in my city that uses this product! It's the best tasting chai EVER!!! I always order it on amazon. and when I run out BOY does it get expensive paying $4 per smoothie at a coffee stand! Get this. you'll LOVE it! If you ever order chai at java crew. this is the same chai they use!!! way more economical to buy your own tubs! YUM!

31583,B002T9GRNO,A2LRJ9UXLLR01L,hummel,0/1,1283299200,Texture is the worst!,I tried this baby food several times. even though it it recommended 7 months & older. my 10 month old baby is not able to handle this food.<br />She's able to chew other. more textured baby food. but this just makes her throw up (literally...unfortunately)!<br />It has a very weird texture. that I've never seen before in any baby food (organic or not)!<br />Even warming it up or mixing it with fruit only food did not help. it looks like it is not moist enough.<br />I can't recommend to buy this food. we didn't have the problem with organic baby food of other brands.
31584,B0083QBWNC,A3DEBQR3DL2I4S,Lyssa,0/0,1349740800,Good for the dog,My show/working dog loves this stuff. It is a great product. healthy. easy to prepare. store. and by the way he eats it.... it must taste good too.
31602,B000E4AKQ6,A7BD0L8TGH82I,Clear Lake,0/0,1263168000,Husband gives it 5 stars,My husband puts Tabasco on everything eggs to pizza and absolutely loved this Mexican chili tea.  I took one sip and wanted to wash the spice off my tongue. but knew exactly why it appealed to him.  I'm sticking with Earl Grey.
31615,B0038B3A0A,ACBRXKFZ63JNZ,Angela B. McGinn angemal,8/8,1293667200,I would give them 10 stars if I could.,These are excellent!  They travel quite well and are even tastier when left in the car to chill during the winter time. They are also awesome when car travelling across the Deep South and fresh green food is hard to come by!<br /><br />Highly addictive. like crack candy!
31619,B0038B3A0A,A14XT7FSP1U5AD,Ed,1/1,1338508800,Excellent Vegan Bar,When you're vegan. you have to be prepared especially if you're going somewhere that isn't familiar. These bars taste good (they're not candy bar good. but they're also much healthier than a candy bar) and are convenient and not messy. Other raw bar makers can take a lesson in how to make non-greasy raw healthy bars.<br /><br />There are quite a few vegan energy bars out there. and these are some of my favorites.
31625,B0038B3A0A,A1R91HFF3O0SEW,Jennifer E Hall,1/5,1331769600,Yuck!,I regularly purchase the power to put in my shakes. That's not the greatest tasting. but it's masked by the other stuff I throw in. But the Chocolate Whole Food Energy Bar is so discusting! Because I bought it and didn't want to waste it. I did eat the entire bar. It will perk you up and give you energy. but I don't think it's worth the horrible taste. I will NOT be purchasing this product EVER again.
31630,B0006VB3TA,A2PFR44TT6VHX8,Thomas Hiday HIDAYROZE,1/1,1325030400,EVERLASTING TREAT,MY DOGS LOVED IT FOR THE TASTE. I THINK. AND IT DID SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY ENJOYED CHEWING ON. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE TITLE SAYS EVERLASTING TREAT FOR DOGS. WHICH I TOOK TO MEAN LAST A VERY. LONG TIME. BUT IT ONLY LASTED ABOUT 1 HOUR. BUT IT WAS STILL A GREAT TREAT FOR MY DOGS. WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
31636,B0006VB3TA,A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ,Thomas F. Harper Jr.,0/0,1338508800,Our dogs second favorite everlasting treat,I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs. but it is with this barbecue version coming in close second! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone. and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old. very big malamute. another pretty old pointer. a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly. part rotty. part small bear. part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats. but they really prefer this flavor and the vanilla mint. The malamute isn't much for chew toys. but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.<br /><br />Update: The malamute figured out if he sawed away at one side until about 1/4 was demolished. that he could then pull the whole thing out and just eat it.  Takes him 5 minutes to eat three of them now.  Good while it lasted! :)
31656,B0029O0EFG,A2T3R6XXD9PAZB,Only Child SHines,2/2,1327276800,Good Food from Amazon,My kitties and I love this catfood. Had some problems with the boy kitty after neutering and he went off his food for over a week. He was wasting away. When he got back to having an appetite (no amount of treats or special foods would tempt him) he went back to chowing down on the GoodLife Recipe food. and regained all the lost weight and muscles he had lost. I believe this food saved his life.
31673,B0029O0EFG,A1HZGQ44DFK6T0,Lovely Mt. View,0/0,1347753600,Best Dry Food!,I have tried numerous dry cat foods. but the one my cats like best is the Goodlife Recipe! Not sure if it's the yummy aroma. or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls. but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food. but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food. and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.<br />Try it- you won't be disappointed!!<br />Pricing on Amazon is great. the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!
31677,B0029O0EFG,A61YBSTS6SIWB,Dvorah Q,0/0,1344729600,Good. but way over-priced,This is a very good cat food; high quality and eagerly gobbled up by 8 picky cats at our house.  Be aware that it is $10 cheaper for the same sized bag at Walmart.  Jest sayin'.....
31708,B0089X1L8U,A5L3L318Q55FI,Alfie's Pal Bichon Mom,1/1,1265760000,Minimal Pomegranite,This flavored tea sounded more delicious than it actually is. It has a definite fruit flavor. but not especially pomegranite -- more of a perfumey essence.  It is not undrinkable. but is not a my favorite. I have been adding honey to it which makes it more palatable.

That said - I liked the idea of trying the health benefits of green tea and. lately. have found a hot cup of tea a great way to start/end the day.<br /><br />This tea is fruity and not bitter.  I add a packet of sweetner in the AM and it is perfect.  I highly recommend this one!!

31714,B0089X1L8U,A31SMX29ZX6WYJ,lizzy,0/0,1338508800,ALMOST AMBROSIA,This is a wonderful. delicate. yet so tasty green tea. The Pomegranate gives it a special. almost zesty. taste. I ordered a box of it for my Keurig machine. and went through the 1st box at record speed. Since then. I order two boxes at a time. Since it's a green (herbal) tea. you can enjoy it any time of day or as a tisane in the evening.  I think you'll like it as much as I do.

31737,B000RQPV1K,AG73B5AES94OW,J. Foster,4/6,1250812800,No complaints whatsoever,Quirky peppercorns. with the little tails. but the tails make no difference when you put them in your grinder.  These peppercorns have a fresh. citrus-y aroma.
31743,B000WJLSE6,A12BTR2MVK2BR5,xenofan,0/0,1340841600,My cat loves this,My cat not only has a sensitive stomach. she's also a very picky eater.  What she loves one day. she'll hate the next.  At one point. I was having to feed her on a schedule of four different types of cat food.  Since discovering this product. however. I only have to feed her two brands (this brand and Whiskas purrfectly fish variety pack).  My cat hasn't gotten bored of this product yet. and eats every last bit out of her bowl.  She seems happy with it. and best of all. it doesn't upset her stomach and make her vomit. as many products that I've tried seem to do.<br /><br />Buyers be warned though---this product is somewhat overpriced from Amazon.  There are other stores online where you can get this for cheaper. and many of them offer free shipping if you don't mind buying two or more cases of 24 cans. in order to raise the order price to reach free shipping.  Check Petco. PetSupplies. PetcareRX and PetSmart as alternative places to buy from.
31752,B0052BRXDY,A31SXZGGA9AGN2,Cuddlekat Kathy Weddle,0/0,1340409600,Simply Great,I know Oreos are celebrating 100 years. and I feel badly about it. but I've had to switch loyalties.  Somewhere along the line they've changed and I am not as fond of them.  I tried the Newman's gluten free version last year when I became Vegan.  Surprise!  These are Vegan friendly as well. not to mention organic if you care about such things.  They are crisper and have a better tasting filling than Oreos (I just bought a bag last week so I did the side by side taste test.) They freeze beautifully (and they are even better frozen by the way.)  I buy them on the subscribe and save plan and am well please with the service.  Note there is some breakage in shipping. but who doesn't have a use for chocolate cookie crumbs?  Love these cookies. I use them with these molds http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Hearts-Cookie-Candy-Mold/dp/B001CEG9Z8/ref=pd_sim_k_1  and Wilton Candy Melts to make fun gifts and party treats. Don't miss the Newman's Ginger'Os if you like ginger cookies. they are a winner too.

Since retiring/downsizing and moving to a large city I do not have the storage space for case orders even when they are available.  However. one small container won't last long here.  This large jug available through Amazon was a good buy for me.  This arrived in a large box with other ordered items.  However. it was securely wrapped in plastic.  This was a good thing since about a teaspoon of liquid had leaked.  The lid was on tight and there was no evidence of mishandling.  The liquid never went beyond the plastic wrapper.  The olives are fine.

All it takes is a can opener and a fork (and unless you're from Maryland -- one should never use a spoon) and a bit of pepper.<br /><br />Yum! Pumpkin is my favorite edible gourd. Though I do miss the delicious pumpkin seeds you can get from fresh pumpkin. Sometimes I'll bake the seeds and throw a little sea salt on top. That's a nice treat on a cool Fall day. I'll make a steaming hot cup of tea and eat pumpkin seeds and just think about things out on my porch.<br /><br />I imagine that Susan Lucci and I are married and that she's very experimental in the bedroom and not afraid to invite company to join us. One time I imagined this so hard I blacked out. I woke on my porch with pumpkin all over my chest and a slight burn on my calf from the tea.

I have two dogs with issues -- one is older and has a little trouble with upset tummy from time to time. and the other was on prescription food -- but this product fixed all that.<br /><br />Now they can eat the same food as the dogs with no issues -- and they all love it! That is a nice plus -- if you are worrying that your dogs won't eat pumpkin. I will be surprised if they don't eat this. My pickiest dog thinks it is wonderful.<br /><br />I also eat some of it myself. because I read somewhere that it is good for humans too. and I like the flavor. However. I didn't try to bake anything with it. so I can't say if it makes good pie or pumpkin bread . . .<br /><br />When I read the reviews. I was a little worried about getting dented cans. but mine were fine -- no dents at all. and nicely packaged in a box.<br /><br />Five stars and two thumbs up from me -- your experience may vary . . .

I have been feeding my dogs pumpkin for years. In the past 6 months it has been very hard to find 100% pumpkin in the stores so I started ordering it.<br /><br />It's also good for humans -- pumpkin pie is very healthy and low fat. if made in that fashion.

I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans. not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family. but we really do not eat pumpkin!  An added plus was free shipping.  I would buy this again.

31978,B0062A87HA,A12DQUAJN9QH23,JudyCA cat lover,12/13,1258761600,3 Cases Arrived Safely. 1 Did Not,After reading all the reviews and comments on the dented cans. I wasn't sure I should order the pumpkin on Amazon. However I took the chance. Amazon is my favorite place to shop.  This is the  pumpkin that I buy at our grocery store.  It is for my 18 yr old cat and it keeps her regular. This is her favorite brand. Also I'm hearing that there is a possibility that canned pumpkin might be hard to find on the shelves after Thanksgiving because of the rains. So I wanted to stock up. I remember a couple of months ago  it was hard to find in some areas.<br /><br />I received the order yesterday and was a little scared to open it up.  But it was fine!! The cans arrived in great condition.  There was a tiny dent on maybe 2 or 3 cans (just like I might find on the grocery shelf). I was very happy with my order.  Maybe it has something to do with the warehouse it is shipping from.  I live in CA and Ontrac delivered it. I've been so impressed with Ontrac. Amazon has been using them alot lately.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered 2 more cases and hope they arrive in the same condition.  The date on the cans is 6/2012. The price per can on Amazon is $2.36. In our store it is $2.99 and when on sale. maybe $2.50.<br /><br />I received 2 more cases that I ordered and they were in perfect condition.  Now I'm all stocked up in case it is hard to find pumpkin on the shelf next year.<br /><br />12/08/09 UPDATE:  I believe it matters on who is delivering the order.  I ordered one more case. For some reason this case was delivered by UPS (the others were all delivered by Ontrac) and some of the cans were VERY  badly dented and cannot be used. I asked for a refund.  No matter who is delivering these cans. Amazon needs  to put some protective packing around the cans so they don't get dented. I will no longer take a chance and order similar products on Amazon.
31980,B0062A87HA,A3GDZVFRCB4KNN,A Happy Singer 8280 Sewer,8/8,1277251200,Farmer's Market is clearly packing dented cans and marketing them through Amazon.com,Like most of the US. our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So. I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews. but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake. I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately. just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product. knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase.
31984,B0062A87HA,A2CGORRQGDEL37,T.C. Owens,7/7,1283990400,Good pumpkin. BUT too many heavily dented cans!,I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans. 5 were undented. 10 were badly dented. and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately. by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However. this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies. I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself. the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin. but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk. I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone. but the ongoing. horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened. they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today. I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it. the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods. Inc.. twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents. of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g.. botulism. bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first. but if the seal is microscopically breached. it may not be fine months from now.  So. when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case. all I can say is:  caveat emptor.
31987,B0062A87HA,A3XGNWVD0GPOI,Lynnette Hafken,7/7,1216684800,Definitely different than Libby's,Blander maybe?  Not sure whether it is supposed to be this way. or I am just used to Libby's. but it is definitely different.

No dented cans.,I have received two separate shipments of this product -- one in December. one in Janaury (2011) and not a single can was dented (some reviewers complained about dented cans so I'm assuming the issue has been resolved). The product is high quality. It is part of the diet I feed to my dogs (home prepared food only mostly raw meat) but I've eaten this pumpkin myself and it is a fine product.

32083,B0009F3SAK,A354ZHJDR7XSWO,Captainette,9/9,1294790400,Effective and easy to drink,I was pleasantly surprised by this tea... I'm in good health generally and I don't take any medications.  I ordered this because the other reviews intrigued me. and I knew I wanted to gently support my liver & kidneys.  I'm not an expert on elimination or anything. but I feel like this makes those processes more effective.  Since last summer I've been on a mission to lose about 25 pounds. so I changed my diet and exercise habits. and lost 20 lbs by November; that seemed to be my limit and I was OK with it.  I started drinking this tea right after Christmas and after 2 weeks. I lost 3 lbs!  I know I probably shouldn't attribute this to the tea but it's the only change that I made to my routine... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a weight loss product but I mention it because it was an unexpected side benefit to me.  I think it does just make it so my body can get rid of waste more completely. on a consistent basis.<br /><br />It tastes good to me. earthy and mild... I like that it doesn't have as strong a licorice flavor like a lot of the Yogi Teas seem to. though it does contain licorice root.  I drink it plain. hot and strong. usually 2 teabags in a 20-oz mug or 1 bag in a smaller mug.  I like to drink it in the morning. and again in the late afternoon when I'm at work.  Since it doesn't contain tea. I like steeping it for even longer than 5 minutes to get the most out of it.  I usually take green tea in the morning. so I've been combining that with the Detox Tea but am going to try the Skin Detox Tea instead. to make it easier.  Also I feel the green tea detracts from the flavor of the Detox Tea somewhat although I still find it perfectly palatable.  Hope this helps!

32113,B0009F3SAK,A1F5OG3ZY2AH57,AZ Lemon,0/0,1315267200,Commenting on Taste,I JUST bought this tea today after reading all about it. It started with reading about Jillian Michaels water mixture that had dandelion root tea in it and I came across the yogi tea. I figured I'd give it a go from the good reviews. Although I can't say anything about the detoxing effects as I haven't used it long enough...I can say the taste is just fine. I am not typically a herbal or licorice liking person. I usually hate the taste. This tea isn't bad at all. I brewed it in a small amount of hot water then made it into iced tea (it's still hot out!) Didn't add sugar or anything which I typically do and I think it's bearable for sure. I'll come back when I've drank it a few weeks and with hope I feel as fabulous as the other commenter's here :)
32128,B0009F3SAK,ATMGQYYCYR2AD,Jocelyn,5/23,1203897600,Poison Tea,I don't recommend drinking this tea quickly. or while on medication. I was on antibiotics and a decongestant and was starting to feel better.  Then. when I drank this tea (one cup in 30 minutes). I felt worse and nauseated.  I don't know if it's the tea itself. or a reaction with the other things in my body. but I'm going to steer clear of this tea.
32138,B0009F3SAA,A3QKRWHSU1A98S,Blue Skies,1/1,1255910400,My favorite,Spiced chai is my favorite tea.  Yogi is the best tasting brand I've found so far. it's not too strong and not too weak.

I've tried a couple yogi teas and wasn't impressed with the taste until I met this one.  I LOVE the taste of this tea.  It also really feels excellent on a sore throat.  I am not a fan of licorice and found that flavor in all the other yogi teas I've tried thus far.  This one does not have any licorice flavor.  It leaves a minty. menthol aftertaste. which I love.<br /><br />Taste is so subjective...if what I've written entices you. I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I haven't yet been able to attest to the immune boosting properties yet.

32363,B001AJ1ULS,AK27Q1G5R44SI,L. Von de Veld,0/1,1272672000,Happy little pappi,I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it. so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her. as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck. she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now. after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day. she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this. and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......
32369,B001AJ1ULS,A3UMYHPG4TB3TS,F. Sassi,0/1,1236902400,Happy hips/Happy customer,Product came in as expected. timely. and well packaged. I knew already the product from the local stores and I was happy to find at a cheaper price at Amazon.com.

32386,B001AJ1ULS,A21XTSJISJEDRU,D15,13/14,1278806400,Causes diarrhea and vomiting!! Do not buy!,I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online. there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both. and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However. I would not recommend these at all!
32389,B001AJ1ULS,A3CNQCO3OZCLHI,Joanne,1/3,1325548800,Dog Medicine (they think it's candy),Every morning after they are fed. two of my Poms get Happy Hips and the third wants in on it.  They think it's a great treat and never not want it.
32399,B001AJ1ULS,A2V2H26LPRZTU1,Kaytlan,11/12,1292716800,Made our dogs Ill,I bought this product last week for our dogs. within a day both were vomiting and refusing food. Our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not. Taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats.
32408,B001AJ1ULS,AJ0I6W0X075VT,REBECCA,7/8,1329782400,OMG....CHINA,My dogs loved these treats!!  Recently my 9 yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick.  Couldn't keep anything down and after 3 days of this we went to pet emergency.  $1200.00 later it was concluded that it was something digested.  Not possible. I spare no expense when it comes to my 3 furry buddy's!  I grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough. MADE IN CHINA.  Went to FDA web site in 2012 and they said chicken from CHINA bad but no recalls yet.  DOGS have been getting sick from chicken products from china. advised not to buy.  Called company and no return call.<br />Trashed them all!!
32424,B001AJ1ULS,A2QQ92LFVVHUJZ,P. Ward,4/5,1322352000,Beware - Made in China,My 8 year old Maltese loved these treats.  I didn't know about the FDA warnings until after he died from a mystery illness that started out as vomiting followed by lethargy.  He had been very healthy before.  The vet did a necropsy and said my dog's liver was severely enlarged and his kidneys were also affected.  Please don't feed your beloved pets ANYTHING made in China.  If I had known about the dangers. I would never have given these to my dog.
32441,B001AJ1ULS,A2FTRXRNDDROA1,Terry Wolff,3/4,1324684800,Made in China. causes some concerns,I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints. especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat. meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win. win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However. I would like to note. that when I started her on these treats. they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know. China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However. when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind. especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still. I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it. that is produced in the USA?
32457,B001AJ1ULS,A2AY39JTK9CUYP,Blondie,0/0,1351036800,Has The Manufacturer Changed the Formula?,I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.
32465,B001AJ1ULS,A3C2SZKKTTS18S,RONALD D LENDERS,0/0,1345507200,Awful advertising - THESE ARE MADE IN CHINA... NOT USA,My dog loves these treats but we recently found out these are made in China. Chicken jerkey products from China need to be avoided. I threw out the rest of these as a result.  Stay away and buy something American made.
32481,B000LKYY6A,AB0TLNLNOAGY4,Shanshad shanachie_shadowfax,2/2,1224806400,Pregnancy Survival!,When I wound up with terrible morning sickness. everyone had some food or method to recommend for feeling better.  I heard it all--and very little worked for me in the slightest.  I spent my days being miserable and feeling sick as anything.  But when I was visiting a friend. she happened to have a package of Gin Gins and offered me one.  I was already chewing on raw ginger to help things. so I figured it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />Rarely has anyting tasted so good as that candy did to my morning sick stomach!  Sweet. but not too sweet. with enough of a gingery bite.  One hard candy could last a while and keep the nausea down.  The first thing I did when I had a chance was order a whole case of the things!  After that I always had a bag tucked into my pocket book throughout the first months of my pregnancy.  Unlike raw ginger. there was no preparation time involved. and the candy is much more pleasant to eat and easier to share with others. (I still like raw ginger and ginger tea. though).  Since then. I've recommended and shared my stash of Gin Gins with several pregnant friends--and they've given me positive feedback as well.<br /><br />Gin Gins also makes a chewable kind--but that's hard on the teeth and can pull out a filling if you're not careful! Plus it's a sharper taste than the hard candies. so it may not appeal as universally.  My only regret is that there doesn't appear to be a sugar free variety of these on the market. and that is something I could have used.  Still. all in all a great investment and one of the most useful things I bought for my early pregnancy.  Beats saltine crackers any day!<br /><br />Enjoy! ^_^ Shanshad

32518,B001EQ5SFG,A3QG4NTDK9PER7,KC,1/1,1263859200,Makes you drink water more often.....,This product is great!!!  Makes you drink water more often.  Walgreens was selling the 50 pk for $5.00 but discontinued selling.  WHY?!  The 8pk can be purchased for $1.00.  So why is this retailer selling a 12 count for $32.50 or $2.70 per 8 pk box?  You can buy 12 boxes yourself and pay $12.00.  The math isn't adding up.<br />Anywho....Still I think this an innovative product designed to make water good to drink with only 5 calories.
32536,B000PHN63Q,A24KFN6PA3ZR29,Theodore L. Osborne Teddybear,0/0,1315094400,It works,Taste isn't everything and this stuff doesn't taste that great but it works and I'm grownup enough to understand the difference. It costs a little less through Amazon but you have to pay shipping. It costs a little more direct and you have to pay tax in California but if you buy 2 or more bottles the shipping is free.

It's so funny when they respond by spiting it out and say That taste like moldy cheese. I crack up:^D hehehehehe!!! I recommend these jelly beans to everyone. I really wish they would come out with a poop flavor. I heard they have owl's poop. However. I never seen it.

ONE with guava is generally flavored well. doesn't have that old taste that the other brands can get. and the guava flavor reminds me of Hawaii.

Thanks so much Purina!
32672,B0083QJU72,A2BQ05H3S39KIZ,K. of Troy,0/0,1287360000,Super Sweet Deal,This is much better than man-made syrups. It is sweeter and has a deeper flavor than the high fructose or corn syrup varieties. I was expecting it to be thick. not runny. but that is not a problem with me. A little of this can go a long way. I was also expecting 32oz to look a little bigger than this jug. but it is well worth it.
32680,B0083QJU72,A1C0AROUHV874P,Very Pleased,0/0,1282262400,Versatile!,Can be used to sweeten a number of food products. Great price compared to retail.

I also have never had grade B before as all that is sold around here is grade A.  Wow. the difference in taste is unbelievable.  It's not as sweet as A and has such a smooth maple flavor.  I tried it out today on my waffles.  Fantastic!  I remember reading that folks use grade A for eating and B more for cooking.  This is only be used for eating!!  I'm so glad I signed up for the subscription offering!

32708,B0083QJU72,A3OK2BF1XWL46V,Nick L. Conner nickilynn,0/0,1258761600,Yumm-O!,I was very impressed with the flavor! Growing up on Mrs. Butterworth's. I developed a taste for commercial syrup and had a hard time adjusting to the real thing. But when I opened up the JUG of Coombs. it was delish! I would highly recommend this product!
32730,B0083QJU72,A1YJ3E4UFA3S6Z,babyangel,0/7,1333497600,worst first expierence,This product completely dissapointed me. Im doing the lemonade diet and i was looking so foward to this maple syrup sweeting my lemonade but boy was i wrong. as soon as i tried it tasted horrible. you get such a nasty after taste. i would never buy this again
32740,B0083QJU72,AZ4559S8F5J4F,Guy Stewart,13/15,1252540800,Very Good. Top Quality.,I grew up on the east coast and have been to the northeast quite a bit and other than right out of the tree. don't think you could find better. This was excellent in my opinion. I bought it on sale for 17.50 which was a steal.
32743,B0083QJU72,A2A6SB596ROUZA,R. Williams,4/4,1307059200,This is an affordable Luxury,Living in Nebraska. we can purchase real maple syrup in the store. but I really like supporting family farms directly.  This way. I'm pretty sure that the products I purchase are top quality.  If not. I can go to the producer.  I'm no conniseuer of maple syrup like some people on Amazon are. but I can say this has a great maple flavor. the consistency is a little thinner than store bought. imitation maple syrup. but that stuff has artificial thickeners in it.  Remember. this is tree sap. boiled down to reduce the water and increase the sugar content.  Nothing more nothing less.  This syrup makes you want to lick the plate when you're done with the pancakes.  One note. they need to do something to better protect the black plastic cap on the top of the jug because mine was broken when it came.  The jug is sealed well. so nothing spilled.  Not a big deal. but someone picky might pitch a fit about something trivial. Buy real maple syrup whether from this company or another. you owe it to yourself.
32744,B0083QJU72,A2E3WMF9RWW2X2,K. Duvall,4/4,1257552000,Yummy!,This is amazing syrup.  You have to watch the price though.  It fluctuates on Amazon quite a bit.  I bought this when it as offered on a buy one get one free deal.  Two bottles for $26!  Better deal than I can find locally.  Works great on waffles. pancakes and in baking.<br /><br />Original review 11/2009.  Update 9/2012<br />I have this item on subscribe.  It is listed as unavailable.  However. it is for sale for a *new* subscription at a savings of only 5% instead of the 15% I have waiting on my list page.  Come on Amazon!  Do you think we would not notice the price change?<br />Watch what you pay since the subscribes are changing so much.  Plus. even if I asked for it now. the policy is not to ship until my assigned date next month anyway.<br />For now. I am going with another product and wait to see if they actually send me a jug of this or just cancel my current subscription to force me to change to the more expensive offer.
32747,B0083QJU72,A1UC6I9XIPPZLJ,"Diana illustrator, reformed hipster",3/3,1267660800,Best syrup I've ever tasted from a Canadian,The quote in the title of this review was from my boyfriend. who grew up in Canada and was convinced that America didn't have real maple syrup. Determined to get better tasting stuff over the generic grade A syrup our grocery store had. I decided to try this Grade B Coombs Family Farms stuff based on the reviews. They weren't kidding. folks! It DOES taste better. The first few times we had breakfast with this. my bf exclaimed This syrup is so good! like he couldn't believe it. He still says it occasionally. Safe to say. this has earned its place as a staple pantry item in our household; with the subscribe and save. it's a pretty good deal.
32757,B0083QJU72,A3GKZ44Q9GO8QZ,Colleen Whalen Tiger Lilly,1/1,1323734400,Deep. Rich Flavor and Family Owned Maple Farm,I love this maple syrup because it has a deep. rich flavor very wholesome tasting. How can people eat the artificial maple stuff from supermarkets?  There is no comparison between 100% maple syrup and the junk sold in supermarkets full of high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors. additives.<br /><br />I have purchased it at natural food stores in the smaller 8 oz glass bottle. didn't note any difference in taste from the plastic jug - this is a terrific price since the 8 oz glass bottle sells for $9.00 which would work out to $36.00 compared to the big jug Subscribe and Save price you save a couple of dollars to purchase it in bulk.  Since 100% natural maple syrup has such a long shelf life it is a good deal.<br /><br />My favorite snack is fresh cranberries. walnuts. raisins. cinnamon. clove and nutmeg and cook it with rolled oats - drizzle Coombs Family Farm maple syrup in it - yummy - especially in the winter for breakfast.<br /><br />A post was written by a person who grew up on a New England maple syrup farm and said there is no difference between organic and non-organic maple syrup but I know I've seen non-organic maple syrup with additives like brown sugar. artifical additives. artificial flavors.

Greene digital junkie,1/1,1292457600,Grade B so much better than Grade A - who knew?,One of the other reviewers explained how Grade B Maple Syrup means that it has gone through the refinement process twice instead of once as Grade A does.  It's so much thicker and mapleier than the Grade A I'm used to buying from stores here in Oregon. that I will never buy Grade A again; plus it's a great bargain. especially on the repeating plan here at Amazon.
32771,B0083QJU72,ANRJ7OJLB3NS1,JM,1/1,1280448000,Organic maple syrup,This syrup is delicious!  I've never tried the grade B. but I wasn't disappointed.  It has a full. rich. mapley flavor and is wonderful on pancakes. waffles. and as a replacement for sugar in muffins. sweet breads and cookies. You only need to use a small amount on pancakes and waffles because it is so sweet.  Knowing that it is organic puts my mind at ease because I know there is no formaldehyde in it. as there can be in other maple syrups.
32787,B0083QJU72,A3GENWJELY2WBX,Liza Levy,0/0,1339545600,Delicious,This dark maple syrup has a wonderfully pronounced maple flavor.  I was glad to learn that in maple syrup. grade B is better than A.  If you are not used to maple syrup. the milder grade A may be better for you to start with.
32793,B0083QJU72,AMYSO2LAWHLU1,Desiree Hayes Boudoir Photographer,0/0,1335312000,Organic. delicious. great price with subscribe and save!,I purchased this because I was looking for an organic maple syrup in a larger size than what I find in my health food store.  I bought the grade B because I noticed it has iron in it (the grade A organic one I purchased prior to this didn't.) I'm vegan so I like to add any extra iron I can. This was delivered within two days (thank you Amazon Prime!) packaged well. and at a great price with the subscribe and save. It's really good. I love it. I also use it in place of sugar in a lot of recipes and to sweeten my husband's tea. My kids love it too. I have to stop them from way over pouring and drowning their pancakes. Haha!

32829,B0016LSKMW,A25FBA1VH87H6C,Shannon,0/0,1332806400,Be careful!,I purchased the six pack of 12 ounce bottles.  Amazon was amazing-as always. and delivered my order in a very timely fashion.  However. the caps were loose on all the bottles.  I didn't think much of it until I realized every single time I served it (as dip. with salmon. with chicken). it ran straight through my family.  I hate to waste so I really tried to see if it was just a coincidence.  Nope.  It does taste great. just like the Trader Joes product. but I wouldn't suggest using it to cook a romantic dinner for two.  lol
32831,B0016LSKMW,A2G874G8S4789U,L. Rothrock,0/0,1301097600,Trader Joe's misses out,I agree this tastes like the Trader Joe version that I can't believe they discontinued.  It is the best sauce and I keep finding some new way to use it. I'm eating less & less meat but I know it tastes great on veggie burgers. eggs and fish. It's worth experimenting.

Thanksgiving. Christmas. and Easter.  We loved it.  Corn pudding is one thing.  Dried corn pudding is something completely different and quite wonderful.  I cannot find this anywhere in the grocery stores now.  I thought that maybe it just wasn't being produced anymore...then I looked on-line.  WOW- so happy.  I will (WILL) be serving this on Thanksgiving this year. 2011.  Can't wait!
32842,B000N425II,ALFJM6UUUJKH9,Starla A. Hart,3/3,1239062400,naturally sweet,This green tea is the best! The mint is not too strong. and there is licorice root added.  You don't taste it. but it adds a natural sweetness.
32843,B000N425II,A1ZCTPZ9HZ6UC0,Cindy,0/0,1297123200,Great tasting tea!!,Shipper sent this to me promptly.  It was well packaged and very fresh.  This is great tasting tea with a nice minty flavor.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
32850,B001P05K8Q,A1MWYUGCGYR3UV,LA,0/0,1294272000,Doggie Crack....and they work,I have long known that if my dogs had to rank their love for treats against their love for me. I'd probably rank first.....but it would be close.  And then we discovered the CET chews.  Not only would the CET chews win over me. my dogs would not hesitate to sell me in exchange for them.<br /><br />Every dog in our extended family is addicted.  I think they lace them with something.  Put them up against a regular rawhide and there is no contest.  We all gave each other chews as gifts for Christmas.  (Which in retrospect was dumb. we could have just kept them and saved on shipping...but who knew?)<br /><br />They do work for teeth cleaning by the way.  I have one dog. a rescue. who has some damaged teeth (one broken. others degraded).  He came to me that way.  I've had them cleaned by the vet more than once but since we've discovered a heart murmur sedating him for a cleaning is no longer an option.  The CET chews have helped.  His teeth are still not great. but there is a noticable improvement in the amount of gunk.  My other dog has nice mostly white teeth and the chews have really helped keep them that way.<br /><br />These were also wholeheartedly approved by my vet.<br /><br />And one last benefit...if you want your dog out from under foot for a few minutes these are also handy for that.  I do use them occasionally when I need some quiet or am feeling like there are just too many german shepherds in the house crowding me.  They happily take them to the back yard and chew away quietly.<br /><br />So big thumbs up here (or paws up. or dew claws up or....you know what I mean)
32860,B001P05K8Q,A1NT0AEI1113LN,W. Donaldson,0/0,1283904000,Great Value,This is a great value.  The C.E.T. chews are a great alternative to raw hide since they dissolve.  I would recommend this item from this vendor to anyone...try pricing these chews at the Vet's office and you'll see why.
32877,B001P05K8Q,A32A9YXUECQNF2,shopper,0/0,1255824000,pleased with these,our vet dentist recommended these as part of a daily routine to help manage one of our dogs dental problem and mean we can spread out his frequently dental cleanings a little more.  He also said they are softer and won't break teeth.  I have 2 labs and they love these.  I don't let them eat them on carpet as I think they would stain.  So far they have really helped.
32884,B001P05K8Q,A7AW6XQHCB9KB,BabyRotty Di,0/0,1246752000,Great company to deal with in all regards,In checking prices online for the CET HEXtra Premium Chews for our Rottie. I was fortunate to find this company.  They were professional. informative. and prompt in their shipment schedule.  I will definitely place future orders for our dog's favorite dental chews through them. /s/ Baby's Mom
32887,B001P05K8Q,A2ZEQ00MBTCMQZ,Carrol Cowan perpetual student,0/0,1245628800,toss your dog's toothbrush,o.k.. I never tried brushing my dog's teeth - he doesn't even like having his coat brushed out.  But when the vet looks in his mouth. he assumes I'm brushing the dog's teeth because these chews keep his teeth so clean.  And he loves them!
32896,B001P05K8Q,A2PBHTSFKRXLG7,Barbara Opal,0/0,1219881600,Love them,I have five Greyhounds and they think this is the best treat.  They last. freshen the breathe and clean the teeth.  This is a great product.
32898,B001P05K8Q,A166UG2632WII2,S. Shelton,0/0,1217635200,Not all EXTRA Large but all EXTRA good...so say my dogs.,I agree that there's a problem with the chews not all being equal size.  But in our family. that's not a problem.  All bags of chews. no matter the brand. seem to have this issue...thick and thin together...but we just use it to our advantage.  We have 2 dogs: the one we raised from a pup likes a big. thick chew. the other is older and a rescue. and though we take him to the dentist regularly. his teeth are just very sensitive so the smaller chews work out great for him.  The ones in the middle they share equally.<br /><br />Another thing. each chew is coated differently.  The smaller more wrinkled up chews have more of it than the thicker chews which have a smoother surface.  But our boys don't seem to notice these small differences and we're happy as long as they're happy.  In fact. one of the best parts of our evening is watching them settle down beside each other. each with their respective CET chew. engaged in knawing away the time.<br /><br />Is CET messing with the consumer by not correctly sizing their chews 100%?  I dunno.  But they are without a doubt the favorite treat in this household and we'll keep buying them here since we can't find a better price elsewhere!
32903,B001P05K8Q,A2A9PDMJNATXSV,Neil Kugler,1/2,1257206400,CET's,Excellent product for their teeth. get it online at half the price of the vet.

Nicholson,2/3,1256601600,Clean Teeth and Great Treat At The Same Time,My two Golden Retrievers have been devouring the CET HEXtra Premium Chews for two years.  These chews have cut down the number of dental cleanings and they just love the chews.  I am really happy with the results.
32930,B001P05K8Q,A2XET9LLTRHR2T,Ann M. Wilm Pet Lover,2/3,1163030400,CET HEXtra chews,I was totally satisfied with the ordering of this product.  It was easy to order and my order was filled and shipped quickly.  I will definitely use them again.
32942,B001P05K8Q,A3LKNN0OCBUITW,topnut,0/0,1345334400,Happy Healthy Doggie!,My dog loves these chews.  She is 8 years old and her teeth are perfect!  Never has bad breath.  This is a high quality product that I will continue to order.
32947,B001P05K8Q,A1VB8UM8V6TWX9,Robert W. Rhodes hia,0/0,1340755200,hygiene chews,Have used these for years. first time I've had a batch this tough; first time ordered from Amazon.  Had to cut in half on a band saw so my 120 lb G. Shepard could chew. Will order from pet supply in future.
32973,B001P05K8Q,A2W3JCTT8IV487,hrmm,0/0,1316217600,Great product. but questionable quality control,We have used this product for a very long time. however our most recent bag almost choked our dogs.  The pieces seem to fragment easily and the dogs will try to eat the chunks as they break off. leading to choking/gagging.  We have never had a problem with our dogs with these dental chews before. so it makes me question the recent quality.  It is possible that these came from  a bad batch as the company manufactures these in MEXICO.  Buyer beware.
32979,B001P05K8Q,AVUMO5RLKZAGK,Maryanne Simpson,0/0,1309564800,Yum-Yum,I buy these for my 100 pound Rhodesian/Lab mix who is a diabetic as well as my 60 pound pitt bull mix. They each get one every evening after my diabetic dog has had his shot as an alternative to the expensive teeth cleaning my vet recommended. By the way. my vet also recommended these chews. They are much cheaper on Amazon.com than at the vet's by far. The dogs really enjoy them and look forward to them every evening. I have noticed less tartar on their teeth as well as fresher breath.  Because I have large dogs. I buy the x-large size; however. the strips do not all come x-large. I get an assortment of small. medium. and large. The dogs do fine with the larger ones. but I find I have to watch the Rhodesian/Lab closely as he will tend to get choked on the smaller ones. This is also a disappointment to the dogs when one evening they get a chew that may last up to thirty minutes. and the next evening they get one that lasts five or ten minutes.
32983,B001P05K8Q,AXRBBDJ9CMNME,Olga Zolochevska Olga,0/0,1306108800,Intestinal problems,I got this product hoping that my dog will have something good to chew every day. But 15 min (if not less) after eating the chew. my dog had a diarrhea. Amazing! Never seen anything work so fast in that direction. So I had to take him out for a walk every 30 min that night. It was that bad! I thought I will send the product back. but started to read reviews. Found one saying that you should give this chew after the meal. Next time I gave my dog Kong stuffed with his regular food. and then half of the chew. and then more food in Kong. 15 min went ok. and he did not have to run outside. Later same day I did it again - food-chew-food. and he was fine. And I have to mention that he is a big boy and never had problems with his stomach before. And he eats different things.<br />Two things I can summarize - watch your dog during and after you give the chew. and give some food either before or right after the chew is gone.
32994,B001P05K8Q,A1142TPVXZGHCU,K. St. Landau Mom the Saint,0/0,1301011200,Soo Good for Your Dog's Teeth,These chews are soo good for your dog's teeth. and most dogs will love them! My 58 lb. Blue Tick Coon Hound would eat them like candy. if we let her! But the limit is usually one per day (in this household).<br />I also work with a Veterinarian. and he says these are the next best thing to brushing your dog's teeth every day. Which sounds good tto clean off their teeth.<br />So if you want to keep your dog's teeth clean. and don't particularly brush them regularly (I don't-and I work with a Vet). these are a great alternative!!o me! He recommends feeding your dog dinner or a meal. then giving your dog one of these a little bit afterwards
32999,B001T3GGXM,A3DFNJCZ8K0SN6,canephora rafman,6/6,1331510400,Luck of the draw!,Ok. so I got these cause they were cheap. First time I ordered they were great! They tasted like all other dried goji berries I had tasted. Second time. they tasted a little bit musty. It is like they have been stored in plastic for a while. and now they taste artificial. They also have a very suspicious bright red color to them. Am I getting what I paid for?
33004,B001T3GGXM,A25358VL8EJWY9,AMula,2/2,1327622400,goji review,the berries look and taste as they should. although there is no way of telling if they are organic or not. my order came in two 1lb plastic re-seal able bags. the shipped with out a problem. also a good price for 4lbs of dry goji
33006,B001T3GGXM,A1OI9OPCM4V03P,Didko,1/1,1336435200,Love it.,if you are into healthy eating. this a must have product. Great for snack. add on to shakes and salads. Also considered a super food in many books.
33008,B001T3GGXM,A1T12UDN6JVOEF,David S. David David,0/0,1347321600,Goji Berries for weight loss?,I read about these for weight loss among other benefits and thought I'd try them.  Make sure you know they are related to the tomato and chili pepper more than a normal berry because they taste more like a bit of dried tomato than a sweet fruit.  Easy to lose weight with them when they taste like dried tomato- make it your only available food :)
33014,B0044WSRDM,A1K7KW5QXA2U61,jg1024,0/1,1291593600,Perfect On Everything,I bought this rub at a food show in DC recently and have been absolutely hooked ever since. My girlfriend and I work long days and don't have much time to prep dinner. so it is nice to know I can come home. sprinkle some of this on a piece of meat. chicken. veggies or whatever. throw it in a pan and have a freaking amazing tasting dinner with little to no effort.  Needless to say. it didn't take long for me to burn through my first three cans and now I am back for more.  Thank you Rub Joe!!

Unfortunately it arrived with the seal broken and powder spilled out into the box.  I tried to process a return to get a new sealed container but this item is ineligible for returns.  I left packaging feedback about the issue and have not gotten a response.  I really hope I can get a replacement. this stuff is not cheap.  I gave this one star because we could not try it.  I will update if we get a replacement and can try it.  We have used the berry flavor.  I think it tastes terrible because it is very very sweet with an artificial sweet taste but my daughter will eat it mixed with plain unsweetened apple sauce.
33055,B001EO7NRE,A8IOWWUDN9EJU,William Drewes Jr.,1/2,1275436800,No Gourmet Here,I had this product before. but forgot how unimpressed I was.  I stupidly ordered it again. same results. Big mouthwatering name. with less than Cracker Jack taste.I will make sure not to order again.

This is now more than 20 years ago.  They are packed in various sauces and oils but my favorite is pure olive oil and lightly smoked. wild caught from the cold waters off Scotland.  I cannot imagine doing better than that.  Most sardine lovers whether they eat them for health (they contain over 2.500mg of Omega 3 fatty acids) or just as a wonderful gourmet food love the tiny ones.  The taste is nut-like and delicious.  I like them best in a sandwich of toasted. seeded Jewish rye with Romaine lettuce.  There's nothing else needed.

Thank goodness I don't have an allergy. esp. since they looked like the ovaries of the flower at first. Some of them were even stained red so they looked like petals. There should at least be a warning that there could be peanut and other allergens in the product. This is just a class action waiting to happen.
33182,B000SATIZA,A1VIXAFRQGQIZF,David,1/1,1334966400,Awesome Tea!,Great tea. I've had it on Subscribe and Save for about three months now. and the strength and quality has been consistently good. I enjoy the whole leaves. use a stainless coffee strainer in a latte mug. steep and sip away! I brew it on the strong side. but it has a cranberry tartness to it. With all the health benefits it has (lowered blood pressure) it's good to drink as an alternative to all of the other junk sodas and sugary juices.
33190,B000SATIZA,A1PDFCXL8CU308,Jimbo,1/1,1326240000,Surprisingly good!,This tea is fantastic!  It has a taste that reminds one of cranberries.  The picture is misleading.  The bag is about 4 times the size of a bag of coffee and has a Ziploc-type resealable closure on the top. It's totally worth the money and I highly recommend it!

It's got a fiery. bold flavor. like the volcanoes of Indonesia. Starbucks' Komodo blend is equally kicky. The Sumatra Coffee is delicious. spicy. piquant... one of Starbucks best. It's stronger than <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ546Y>Starbucks Breakfast Blend Coffee.

33243,B001EQ54M8,AWVSCPEG6CHXG,Lisa Loung,1/1,1335916800,Great for Black Coffee Drinkers!,All a sudden I started to drink black coffee. and it started with the Starbucks Sumatra.<br /><br />I know. you are probably thinking. EW. Starbucks?! Yes! I was shocked as well!!<br /><br />I French press my own coffee since the bill started adding up each time I went to Starbucks and bought a cup each time ($4.11 to be exact). WOW. the taste is absolutely amazing! I do not even want to put in any cream/milk/sugar... NOTHING into my cup of Sumatra coffee. The taste is rich. bold. and it has a pleasant bitter kick to the end with no bad after taste. It definitely has an earthy flavor as claims to have which make this coffee even more wholesome to me.<br /><br />What makes it even MORE awesome is that it tastes expensive. but the price is out of this world! I bought my own pack at my local grocery store on sale for $7.99. Can you believe how much money I have saved? I really look forward to waking up in the morning and drinking this cup o' joe.

There is a Port Rico Importing website that has inexpensive coffees. Fresh ground daily. Love them. When they figure in my zip code (which is in the same region as they are). the shipping costs are twice the cost of the coffee!<br /><br /> Again. important - free shipping.

My roommate says that they just taste like pretzels.<br />I like that the taste is not overwhelming. but I guess it's not for people that like snacks with really strong flavors (like Doritos).
33299,B000G7P50M,AB5SJ1FFR1WWU,R. James,0/0,1310774400,Great low-fat snack!,This is a great-low fat snack that I eat between lunch and dinner almost every day. It has a good flavor and fills me up after just a few pieces. Buying them in bulk like this has saved me a lot of money versus buying them one or two at a time from the grocery store. and the free shipping to my door is a wonderful perk.<br /><br />I do wish there was a little more seasoning on the pretzels. something between these nibblers and the pieces would be my ideal amount of seasoning. but that would add to the fat content. Other than that. I don't have any complaints.

It is easily  available at our local supermarkets.<br /><br />I would like to see subscribe and save of amazon become more popular and useful as it allows us to simplify things. But boy. someone at Amazon needs to listen to the customers and understand that the customers are educated.<br /><br />Many many of your grocery prices are silly when compared with local market prices in US. This product is a perfect example. It sells at normal MSRP for $9.99/lb in Austin TX in WholeFoods or SunHarvest. yet amazon price is $16.67/lb for a bulk pack? In fact this trend is true in many of the departments. Amazon needs to start showing prices that are real rather than try to show a big discount. A good mindset to follow would be that of Costco/Sams rather than a shady pawn show.<br /><br />Fix it. and amazon's subscription business for groceries & household utilities will take off like you wouldn't belove it. I  for one would be happy to shift *all* of my reoccurring. non perishable food supply to Amazon.

There is the tag line Fine Belgian Chocolate. as well as the reminders that the confection is gluten free. carb controlled and all natural.<br /><br />Interestingly. while the Total Carbs dose is listed as 19g. the Net Carbs is but 2g and the Non-Impact Carbs is 17g. I had to ask the in-house expert about that last bit. and she said that was the non-digestible total represented by the 15g Maltitol plus 2g Dietary Fiber. Gee. who would've guessed?<br /><br />But. for me. the MOST INTERESTING component of the label is the very small print advisory that Excessive consumption may have a mild laxative effect. What's that all about?<br /><br />A bit of research reveals that maltitol is one of several polyols. i.e. low digestible carbohydrates. which can cause flatulence and. um. loose stools. It seems that each polyol has a certain laxation threshold. which is the amount of the polyol that can be consumed on a daily basis before the laxative effect is likely to kick in (though the outcome. so to speak. differs among individuals). The threshold is expressed as the LTV. or Laxative Threshold Value. The relevant point here is that the LTV for maltitol is 100g - or just over six DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bars! Is seven excessive? (I wonder if that many cheeseburgers have the same effect. Maybe if they're double-doubles. You think?)<br /><br />Also of note was the fact that Amber Lyn Chocolates. Inc. is located in St. George. UT. I've driven through there twice without taking much notice. I may have to go back; perhaps the company has a factory outlet store. If so. I'm in!
33342,B000LRKN9A,A2UFHATEG76AO5,Rosalinde Rosalinde,1/1,1257379200,Delicious apricot juice *****,This is the very highest quality apricot nectar.  I looked for it for a long time and was happy to find this  premier brand. sold by Parthenon Foods.  We stock up with several bottles at a time so we always have it on hand.  Hero makes excellent fruit products in general.  This is a rich and satisfying juice and one of their best.
33358,B007JFMH96,A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH,The Three Woods mommy2lile,2/3,1343520000,Soft but very dry and practically tasteless.,If you are expecting Grandma's soft and deliciously moist cookies. you will be seriously disappointed. 6 small cookies come in the package. Out of the six. two did not have even ONE chocolate chip on them. For size and content. please take a look at the pictures I have uploaded.<br /> The flavor leaves a lot to be desired. While they are soft. they are very dry if that makes sense. You feel the need to drink a LOT of milk or water with them. Out of our family of four. two of us thought they were horrible tasting and two thought they were okay. Price wise - just not worth it.
33364,B007JFMH96,A30UIZJMFL9PLT,Jish M.,0/0,1348099200,Tasty. dry. and pricey,The only reason I'm dinging these cookies 1 star is because they are a little pricey at $1 a cookie (for a boxed product).<br /><br />Having said that. I (and my kids) thought they were yummy. but be sure to have a glass of milk handy since they are on the drier side.  Nice and moist and not too crumbly.  The packaging kept the product sealed nicely over time and the cookies didn't dry out or get hard.
33393,B007JFMH96,A1QGDMR4XJOA6N,Top Dragon,0/0,1343952000,Suprisingly Not-so-Good,I'm usually a pretty big fan of Quaker products and I was certainly tempted by the picture on the box.  It's great that whole-grain oat flour is used to make these cookies. and it's also great that each cookie comes with 4 grams of dietary fiber which is about 16% of what we each need in an ideal day.  The taste however. is merely OK and that's putting a good spin on it.  I was glad to see that each cookie is individually wrapped and when I unwrapped my first cookie. it certainly seemed moist and inviting.  But when I bit into it. my anticipation turned to disapointment. The fiber must come from sawdust because that was my first thought.  The flavor was mediocre at best. not very strong and not. unfortunately. enough to overcome the fibrous texture.  I wish I could taste some of the almond flavor and a bit more chocolaty goodness instead of the bland nature of the oat flour.<br /><br />So if you're looking for healthy snacks. there are better alternatives out there that offer all of the fiber. etc. but without the 180 calories per cookie.  And if you're looking for a good tasting cookie. well. then I'd avoid this product all together.
33444,B000VHJPKI,A16AGV6M8MVRBC,racheal t,0/0,1346630400,yuck!,This sauce is gross!  I bought it knowing that it was a diet food. but didn't expect it to be that bad.  It didn't taste anything like BBQ sauce.  I can't even describe how awful it tasted or what it tastes like. Luckily I bought it at a local store. and didn't pay the higher rate on here or shipping.
33448,B000VHJPKI,A27QQCZ2K972U6,AB,0/0,1341187200,Love this stuff!,I haven't purchased this item here. I get it at my local grocery. however. I love the stuff.  I do not use it as BBQ sauce though.  I agree with some of the comments stating that it is a bit thin. and not really BBQ flavored.  However. I do use this more as a condiment. instead of catchup or 57 sauce - for THAT purpose. with zero cal.carbs. etc...it is an awesome product! :D I also really enjoy the flavor.  But taste is completely individual.  It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)
33451,B000VHJPKI,A3R5TUC0Q9KG2H,T. Hamm,0/0,1327622400,Welcome taste relief in my diet,I am on a low carb and sugar diet. and needless to say I have been craving some of my old foods. My expectations were medium to low. but I am very surprised by this stuff. it helps me so much. Its a bit runny which sort of stinks. but the flavors are pretty good considering it has no calories and is made out of some suspect stuff. I season my protein more to kick up the flavor a bit more. but I enjoy it. Its not the best BBQ sauce ever but for not having calories it rocks. I like this the most of all the walden farms stuff I have tried. Look at a grocery store for a price cut; I got mine at Albersons.
33466,B0011FYQR6,A1S2IZVZMS49PD,Margaret,1/2,1330992000,Safer brand insect remover.,I was pleased with this. It did remove some insects from my roses that had not been removed with other brands of reppeller.
33473,B003AK90N0,A2AYP7YH91UEE7,Patrea Robyn Rhea cat lover,0/0,1333065600,aged cheese crisps,this was just not to my taste. it was fresh and in a nice package however i did not care for the taste.
33475,B001TER7OS,A3C04M9JBM2B8L,J. Jones,2/2,1342569600,Magic Crystals,I purchased this product after reading the book Water and Salt by Dr. Barbara Hendel. I would highly recommend both the book and the Himalayan crystal salt. I make the salt sole solution by disolving the crystals in Figi water and take a teaspoon of the sole in a glass of the Figi artesian well water each morning when I first get out of bed. It wakes me up and makes my body feel alive! Knowledge is power. Read the book. It is very informative as to the benefits of Himalayan salt verses the adverse effects of regular table salt. It is an eye opener!
33515,B006N3I84I,A2JS7QUISWJ8DN,Skye Lark,2/2,1340496000,Prefer Barrista,This coffee is just ok; personally I prefer Barrista Italian - it's just more robust.  Barrista may cost more. but the flavor is far superior to Tully's.
33536,B006N3I84I,A3EZVJ0EM3PVYA,free2bpbh,0/0,1349222400,Great cup of Joe!,I just bought this coffee and I think I am in love!  This is the perfect cup of coffee for me. very smooth. strong. and aromatic.  I had been drinking another brand and had it on subscribe and save. but I changed to this after buying my first box.  There is absolutely no bitter taste or aftertaste with this coffee.  I am one satisfied customer!
33563,B006N3I84I,A2EOJL2J0ZZ4OT,Gift Seeker frantastic,0/0,1326585600,Mellow,No bitterness here...this is a hearty but mellow choice in the Tully's lineup.  We especially like the 50 pack convenience.  Jet Fuel is also great.<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HPGVPK>Delightful Short Stories Little Romances</a>
33595,B000LLM9GQ,A1U0D7C230GS5S,Joseph R. Barnhart Sr. Dr. Joe,0/0,1325462400,No fish here,Horrible stuff. does not smell fishy. smells rotten. taste like metal. mushy. just bad expensive tuna. Can not get pass the smell. Rotten.
33600,B0007OPVYE,A3CDELT3J8E1A8,S. Carpenter,0/0,1333670400,Nice Memories,Gave me great memories from when I was a kid. buying these at a restaurant after church on Sundays. Friends made the same comment when I shared.
33613,B004KPFUCO,A1W2DNOW9E37N0,M. Austin,1/1,1327881600,Best price on the Internet!,I use Palm Sugar for adding to cereals and sometimes in place of brown sugar for baking.  Gives it a little different taste which is good.  Delivered on time and it was the best price I could find.
33622,B001G5L4US,A2OXV11XOXBQ5J,dude,0/0,1340841600,crap,These hambugers had no taste. I think the box they were shipped in would of had more flavor. Don't waste your money on this product unless you need a hockey puck.
33641,B001H024PQ,A2OLS9H2XHRLPI,Heather,0/0,1344297600,Could have been worse.,Not the best tasting lollipop the flavor was basically just sugar. They did come packaged very well though and none of them were broken. but I wouldn't purchase if you actually plan on eating and enjoying them.
33653,B000633S78,A1C42FCHJK92Y2,charlie's mom,0/0,1292544000,Everyone loves it.,I have three cats and it is loved by all especially charlie.  In the morning. he stares at the refrigerator until he get his milk.  I have tried other brands and they turn their noses up at it.
33654,B000633S78,A2WKCA0UDRG4IU,M. Anderson,2/4,1156032000,very pleased,this was my first time ordering online and I have to say. I'm very happy with how quickly it was delivered. thanks alot
33658,B004N66R6I,A2CHTUKTO98QG9,K. Angelin,8/8,1327017600,Made in China. FDA says contaminated!!,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name. Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse. no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic. These lovely little treats nearly cost me the lives of both my dogs. as well as over $500 in vet bills and time off of work.
33668,B000CONMBS,A1ELW55VCZ1BVB,R. Koehn compulsive shopper,44/45,1155254400,I'm a convert...no more Cheetos for me!,I tried these on a whim after hearing about Veggie Booty for a long time.  I knew I wasn't ready for VB. but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff.  I previously thought that a day without Cheetos was a day wasted. so this was a big change.<br /><br />These are the best things ever!  They taste like real cheese and there's some variation in the intensity of the flavor - every single one doesn't taste exactly the same.  They aren't as crunchy as Cheetos and don't turn your fingers orange!<br /><br />After trying a couple bags purchased at the grocery store. I decided I loved them enough to invest in this 12-pack from Amazon.  Okay. so maybe I went a little wild and had a bag (or two) a day until they were gone - don't judge me!<br /><br />Try these out!  Buy a bag at the grocery store and then get the 12-pack.  You'll be very happy that you did!
33699,B000CONMBS,A1I05FSB6EZXR3,Love to shop,0/0,1338768000,Yumm!,I was worried my family would not eat an entire case before getting tired of this. but it was gone before I knew it. I don't feel as guilty snacking on Pirates Booty as I would chips. My kids love it and I can share with my baby. One of our favorite snacks!
33713,B000CONMBS,A25VZQE4LVDZJL,Bruja Juera,0/0,1318723200,My 1 yr old daughter's FAVORITE snack!!,Pirate's Booty has been my 16 month old daughter's favorite snack since she was 6 months old. Great for babies who are just starting on solids because it dissolves easily in their mouth. it's gluten-free. low in sodium (has less sodium than cheerios) and it just plain tastes good. I usually throw some Pirate's Booty in a snack saver cup and carry it in my diaper bag when I'm out running errands. Whenever my daughter starts to lose her patience. I pull it out and Viola!! I've got a happy baby again. I swear. this stuff is magic!! Don't know how I would have gotten through this past year (or gotten anything done) without it!! : )<br /><br />At our local grocery store. a 4 oz bag usually sells for $2.99. Buying it by the case using Amazon's Subscribe and Save program. it comes out to $1.78 bag. That's a pretty good deal in my book. especially considering how much of this stuff my daughter can go through.
33714,B000CONMBS,A3U4NWIGAIF3PH,Aje85,0/0,1317686400,It's so ridiculously good. They are big bags. Much cheaper than most grocery stores.,It's so ridiculously good. They are big bags. Much cheaper than most grocery stores. It's such a light food on the stomach too. I can easily down a while bag in no time and not feel full.
33739,B000CONMBS,A1HNQ8JB3OLNW9,C. McPherson Spydr McPherson,0/0,1190764800,I Love Booty!,I love Pirate's Booty.  This stuff is addictive and since I can't find it in town. I have to order by bulk.  I guess that doesn't matter as I eat it bulk too.<br /><br />It is light. non greasy and the flavor is grand.  Not too much cheese. not too little.  It is just right.  I love it!
33779,B0006341OM,A3DA0UZXPLYS8F,Patrick,0/0,1329091200,Great Product!!!!,Got these for a new puppy as a gift and she love them and as you can see by the there is no plastic in them.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Rice flour. sweet rice flour. gelatin. glycerin. water. corn<br />gluten meal. peanut meal. cellulose. carrageenan gum.<br />lecithin. brewers yeast. garlic powder. sesame oil. fennel<br />seed powder. fish oil. cod liver oil. naturally preserved with<br />mixed tocopherols (a source of vitamin E).
33789,B000JZ9ATS,AAIJT4YYRY83Z,ABC DEF,2/2,1227052800,Great gum. except Bubblemint flavor,I liek this gum a lot and appreciate all the flavors. except Bubblemint which runs out of flavor very quickly.  I think the pieces are nice and big too. like a large Trident.
33791,B000JZ9ATS,AW6R1WOQ4ICNZ,YourDaBest,1/1,1282003200,great idea - but go to your local whole sale club,I love buying gum this way - but 1/3 the cost at my local wholesale club! works out to less than 1/2 the cost of buying at the store individually (around $0.65 per pack)
33794,B000JZ9ATS,A25IN8E5N6HJ16,Charles G. Read,0/0,1310083200,Where's the flavor?,The flavor in this product disappears quickly and what you have left is a plastic-like product bouncing around within your mouth.  Not a nice experience.
33808,B001E5E0I8,A3KTLQL58GF2RV,Jason Conlon &34;mr. gringo&34;,2/2,1275782400,excellent,These are addictive. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I once found a brand that came in whole sections instead of the small pieces. That brand was called Go Mango by Hunza. Website is [...]. But you have to buy like $50 worth at a minimum. They are cheaper that way. The other problem with these ones from Amazon is that I ate them in like a week. There isn't a lot with the way I go thru them. But I like the fact that the only ingredient is mango. Really. why do you need to mess with nature?
33812,B001E5E0I8,AYWUHB7N8XGZQ,Evelyn A. Getchell Evie,3/4,1267315200,Yummy!,These Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes are really very tasty. maybe the best I've tried so far but I was surprised to see how small these packages really are. That is entirely my own fault for not paying closer attention to the weight ~ these bags are only 3 ounces each. hardly two servings worth of dried mango per package. Considering the price. they aren't the best value in dried fruit but nevertheless they are still yummy. The pieces are quite small and rather bite-sized. The fruit is very sweet. soft and moist ~ not hard and shoe-leathery like some other dried mango products. They have been organically grown (although it states nowhere on the package that they are unsulphured like other Made In Nature fruits) and they are a product of Mexico or Ecuador.<br /><br />So I give Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes. 3-Ounce Bags an overall 4 stars ~ 5 stars for quality. 3 stars for value.
33821,B001EQ5CSE,A2TVXC56BVDYLD,Laurel in California,1/1,1278201600,I have been drinking this coffee for years!,I love this coffee!  It has been my regular morning brew for many years. and everyone I have ever served it to also loves it.  I don't like dark roasted coffees. but that is pretty much all you can buy these days.  I also don't like South American coffees; I find them too light and acidic.  This medium roast mocha-java is just right for me.  Robust and flavorful. but without the burned. oily taste of a dark roast.
33832,B0002DJFUQ,A39DYVUNTMHEPK,Htc,1/1,1180483200,Pugs not interested.,My two pugs are major rawhide/bone/pig ear fans but for some reason they aren't too interested in these chews. One will eat it once he realizes he's not getting anything else and the other doesn't even bother with it.
33869,B0026LN472,A25I6FGSZEP5Q,E. Rice,0/0,1325289600,My cats love it. and it's healthy.,I learned about this product from the shelter where I adopted my newest cat who is 3 years old.  They recommended it strongly. so I introduced it to my 14-year old who preferred it over Science Diet. Now I can feed both age groups the same food. I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and healthy.  It's hard to find the 15-lb bag. so I like buying this from Amazon.
33876,B0093QSF8Q,APJO8LYGG8MLX,M H S,0/0,1324598400,great. but these come in a box without a liner...,great candy. just as you would get in the store. however they came shipped in a corrugated cardboard carton direct from jelly belly without a liner ( literally. the candy was just in the box with nothing else- no plastic bag. etc). which was a bit off-putting. However. I assume that if this is how I get it. this is how most retailers get it. meaning I've been eating jelly beans direct from a cardboard box my entire life. I ordered four different flavors of jelly bellies and they all came this way. No one got sick. so I assume this was sanitary.
33878,B00412W76S,A38LIPX6GHLI9X,Dashpie,0/0,1347062400,Great Tea,Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again

33922,B00412W76S,AJ106JEO96BXI,grandmom,0/0,1296172800,Time for tea!,This tea is lovely for a refreshing iced tea. a comforting hot tea or mixed into a light Sangria.  'Hard to find. but worth the effort.
33933,B00412W76S,A1D76XJYSQPKIU,A. Bowens,1/2,1241136000,Hawthorne Berries,Received in good condition and in a timely manner.  Great for relaxing the heart.
33948,B00412W76S,A3IMFBFX5L85S9,Ashima Gupta,0/2,1326844800,No taste or flavor,I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.
33958,B00412W76S,A3TJPSWY2HE4BS,S. Layton homeschool blogger,1/24,1173312000,,I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste. but I'm not a big tea fan either.
33960,B00412W76S,A25NYC06X34V46,C. Taylor,16/16,1259625600,Menopause Relief,I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
33966,B00412W76S,A1DI7KMBSK5MTU,Victoria Satterfield,11/12,1250726400,Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!,I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously. my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings. tags. or staples like most teas.
33973,B00412W76S,ANJSMWN361NSG,L. Donovan,7/8,1203638400,Sage tea,Great product. Does not completely get rid of hot flashes and night sweats. but seriously reduces their number and intensity. I tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference. I now get reasonable sleep at night.
33978,B00412W76S,ARXU7TM4XXI1D,Emma M. Diaz Emma R.,3/3,1332288000,No more breast milk!,Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway. I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain. though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.
33980,B00412W76S,A2OETFZ7IA6XSQ,Jenn Barlow,3/3,1318636800,Great for colicky acid reflux babies,We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.
33984,B00412W76S,AFUM9UDF7IN6I,Nikki,3/3,1297728000,This stuff is great!!,This tea not only  aids in digestion. but this tea also has a calming affect..it's a very relaxing tea.I drink it alone or w/honey. I always have some in my pantry. Great after a long  stressful day. I definitely recommend this product.
33991,B00412W76S,A17AQQD8K5WB63,sss147,5/6,1318464000,delicious,This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it worked because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus.
33995,B00412W76S,A2SLUYU6MAY7BE,K. Tennessee k. Tennessee,2/2,1318032000,soothing,Maybe this is a placebo effect however. since I have been drinking this tea. sometimes in the morning and some times at night. I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood.
34005,B00412W76S,A2E3TRWY14IQBL,Pen Name,1/1,1346457600,amazing!....,I purchased this item a month ago and i drink a cup morning and night. I love it! I drink it with clover honey...
34007,B00412W76S,A34E1744VPQCNU,Dbp323,1/1,1337299200,Dbp323,Recommend it to all.  Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker.  I loved it during a URI. upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous.  Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing.  I now brew it for cold tea as well.  Very refresshing.

34051,B0042MALDS,A2OP73TEUKY53L,El Con,2/4,1343174400,Terrific!,Bought this for my wife. She loves it. but my son can't get enough of it. I'm glad I got it for her.
34058,B000LKVDUU,AUY3W255E6M1C,Jason,2/2,1269216000,Surprisingly Delicious,I usually have pretty low expectations for boxed dinners. but this dish certainly was surprisingly full of flavor. There was plenty of spice. so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a fan of hot. spicy food. but if you are buying food from this region. it's probably to be expected (the description calls it mildly spicy). The vegetables dominate the mixture. which was very easy to prepare. even in the microwave. Despite what the box says. you get one nice-sized serving per package. Considering this isn't a dish most would be likely to make on their own. it's a nice cullinary departure and worth a try.
34059,B000LKVDUU,A3RWG8GN7XHBKL,Katie,2/2,1256083200,Not like the restaurants. but still good on its own,This definitely does not taste like the vegetable/navrattan korma I've had from restaurants. This is kind of oily and the vegetable korma I order out is always creamy. This also has cubes of cheese. which I've never had in my vegetable korma before. However. I think it has a good flavor. If I could describe it in non-Indian terms. it's a bit like a minestrone flavor. but of course it has that curry gravy. I would agree with the other reviews. I noticed maybe three pieces of cashew in this. I thought vegetable korma has raisins in it too. but this doesn't seem to have any. This is actually one of Kitchens of India's lower-calorie offerings -- I wondered how vegetable korma could be low calorie. but now I see it's because it's not creamy the way it is at restaurants. Still. it's decent if you don't expect the same thing you'd order out. Would go well with some basmati rice.
34070,B000LKVDUU,A3J4IM04W99U3O,Kevin Meade,0/0,1350086400,Smells Great but...,This smelled great coming out of the microwave.  However. you can tell soon after that this is clearly a pre-packaged meal.  The ingredients inside have all become quite blended together which is not really something I like.  I suppose this is part of what happens to foil packaged and preserved dishes so I should not be too hard on it but still. a disappointment.<br /><br />Though I ate it all. in the end I won't be buying it again.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!
34072,B000LKVDUU,A2L7GKE1AN01ZH,NE_Foodie,0/0,1286582400,Tasty food in minutes,This product is easy to make. healthy and tasty. Of course it's no substitute for real Indian food. whether homemade or take-out. but it's perfect when you're home alone and need something flavorful and quick to eat. I purchased this meal to cook when my husband travels. I made it tonight and added about of 1/4 cup of additional cottage cheese and topped it with some nuts for more flavor. For $3 and about 5 minutes of my time. this is was one of the better meals I've had this week. I will definitely eat this again and I look forward to trying more of their products.
34106,B004N8LMFM,A3CO14S49URAD9,Raphael,0/0,1337731200,Fun to make,Very expensive. fun and easy to make.candy. my children had a lot of fun doing it. the candy tasted very good (I had to wrestled a piece away). I wish they will sell it locally. The item came on time. The instructions are in Japanese but just follow the pictures and the water levels are mark in the mold.

34128,B000UBJL4U,ARYSDAZNRXN6G,A. Crafton,4/6,1263686400,Make your own!,This stuff is so bad. you may as well call it 'crap in a packet'. There are few words to describe the Walden Farms dressings/sauces. that can be printed here on Amazon. If Clorox made mouth rinse. I'd need it after tasting these chemical bombshells.
34137,B001QTKZ1I,A1G864YSQ5AI19,C*Butterfly,0/0,1349136000,Finally The Original !,I was so very happy to have found this after looking for it for so long. It tastes better then store bought Fresh milk! This NIDO Powder is just so natural. no preservatives or funny taste. I usually use it with tea instead of regular milk. or with cereal.  I ran out of milk last night actually. so I just added 3 full teaspoons to a glass of water and Voila! rich authentic taste. Can't praise it enough!  Brought me back to my childhood. I had bought 4 tins and I loved them so much I gave one to a friend to try! she loves it and now I'm ordering more. probably 8 this time! I love NIDO . this particular one not he ones that have baby pictures on them. those have added Vitamins I think. Not the same taste. Great Seller smooth transaction arrived a few days early which was a great surprise. Thank you
34158,B003CL6Q84,ATHKDDEXC041L,ASIA,2/3,1273968000,Great product!,Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient. inferring that if that was the case. there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels. and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food. it seems to have a good nutrient profile. my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool. in fact the clean up has been minimal so far. poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it. considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching. had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time. one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.
34165,B0009VFGKO,A1FKEP7GR2FSKX,Suzi1780,0/0,1333411200,My cats think they are okay,When I first got these. all 4 of my cats FREAKED over them. Now. they don't seem as excited about them but they do eat them. I don't know if I will purchase them again after this bag is gone. I would rather have some treats that help with tarter control.
34184,B000QV0M6A,A1BIZOUBLYA0MY,C. Stevens CLStevens,0/0,1347235200,Homerun!,I ordered this as a surprise for my husband who loves bubble gum.  He was like a kid again when he opened the package.  He displays it proudly on his workbench and every coin we have ends up in it.  Ladies. get yourself some serious brownie points with this one.  It's worth every penny.
34196,B007OBWXN0,A2KFQEY3DY98Z3,Gary A. Fechter gfechter,0/0,1340928000,Folgers Coffee K-cups,Excellent taste and no after taste.  It tastes exactly as if you would brew 20 cups in a regular coffee maker. except 1 cup at a time fresh.
34205,B001P3NU30,ARX7J4K7R8YJ8,K. M. Redding,0/0,1308182400,Awesome product,These were recommended by our vet because of the quality.  You will see an immediate improvement with the first chew. but takes a much longer time to remove that really bad plaque.
34230,B001P3NU30,AK88IO4I5GGL9,Shay Burdette,0/0,1289088000,Vet recommended these -- they're fabulous!,My vet said she gives these daily to her dogs.  My dogs' teeth and breath have improved and these are not harsh on their digestive tract.
34242,B001P3NU30,A2V5WP3QMSLTNL,Meemaw,0/0,1284076800,GOOD PRODUCT!,This was a repeat purchase.  I have used C.E.T. chews for years for all my dogs.  previously purchasing them at my veterinarian's.  Now that I have found I can order them at Amazon.com at a better price. I will be purchasing the chews only from Amazon.  I use the large for my dogs. which weigh from 30 to 36 pounds.  They are the perfect size for them.  They satisfy the chewing need and help keep teeth and gums in good condition.
34245,B001P3NU30,A2VXI44AA9KNJT,RON,0/0,1279929600,CET CHEWS,IT'S THE ONLY CHEWS MY DOG WILL EAT. SAME THING FOR MY FRIEND'S DOG. THE CHEWS SEEM TO KEEP THE PLAQUE TO A MINIMUM. GREAT PRODUCT.

They really help keep her  teeth white and her breathe clean while adding no calories. I buy them at Amazon because the price is lower and the service is quick.
34271,B001P3NU30,A2SSLNCM6N6F37,Garth Gregory,0/0,1231718400,Worth the money,I have been spending at least $150.00/dog/yr for dental cleaning....after only 4-5 months their teeth were starting to look dirty again...my Vet recommended these....I have always been suspect of rawhides but these have enzymes in them...gave them one a day for two weeks and then twice a week after that....don't think they will have to have their teeth done for a while....they look great....when the teeth look slightly dirty...give them one a day for 3-4 days....they look better again....also...got these at half price...even better....
34283,B001P3NU30,A2339F1LWNPJRE,Baroni,3/5,1206057600,CET Chews for Dogs,I have two German Shepherds. 8 years old. Every morning I give them each a CET Chew. which they enjoy. Their teeth are sparkling white. and their gums are healthy. which eliminates the need for costly dental cleaning and the dangerous anesthesia. I recommend this product without reservation as being very good for dogs.
34286,B001P3NU30,A4C18GBYZP62Q,S. Richard Chaplain,3/5,1185321600,CET Chews really help,These chews really help keep the tarter build-up minimized on our 9 year old Aussie's teeth. I still need to brush his teeth periodically. but the CET Chews keep his mouth in pretty good shape when I do not have time for the brushing routine.
34299,B001P3NU30,A2TT9RNYR1GEMI,A. Rebecca Owens,1/19,1237507200,ordered the wrong chews,I ordered the wrong chew. I meant to get one that had the HEXTRA coating (I think that's how you spell it) but got plain chews instead. However. it was disappointing that this product was a Canadian one. I think that it should have been clear on the website. Canadian import. Maybe it's there and I just didn't notice. I ended up sending it back. I will say that the store I bought it from (Entirely Pets) was very prompt in shipping it out. but not as prompt with the refund process. I had to call twice to find out what was going on. I had gotten a return authorization number prior to shipping it back. so I'm not sure what held up the process.
34300,B001P3NU30,A37GFKV81AL1VF,D. Miyao,112/120,1261440000,Be careful.  May be good for teeth but present a choking hazard.,I have a 1 year old lab/Shepard mix and she is a very active chewer.  I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor. but because the rawhide is so thin. she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it. I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today. she choked again. and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these. but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds. 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.<br /><br />Edit -<br /><br />My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children. the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of is this useful votes is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.  I hope this isn't the case because they would be toying with the danger of killing our dogs.
34306,B001P3NU30,A3TCA33GJ8EZDW,R. Fenton,6/6,1331164800,please be aware of choking danger,my dog loves them but in the trash they go<br />these are quite dangerous; they shred and cause the dogs to choke;
34309,B001P3NU30,A2XWNJ21D5UMDO,Barbara A. Shube,3/3,1329696000,dog dental chews,I have been giving this product ( one a day) to my dogs (past and current) for many years.  It has proven to be a boon to aiding in the reduction of plaque on their teeth. and. they love to chew on them.  The chew factor also helps to keep them occupied for a while. and. they love the taste.
34317,B001P3NU30,A1TWVTF8OCZZE1,mardi,2/2,1277942400,Dental hygiene chews,I found that the boys liked the chews but my older dog. who never had any rawhide. had blood in his stools from it...the Vet said to only give it once or twice a week. I will continue the chews as they work like bones in removing the tartar from the teeth.  I do feel they are overpriced.
34321,B001P3NU30,A1ZANX10ZF6LMO,djpoints,1/1,1340323200,AWFUL. Do NOT work and are a Choking Hazzard,Simply awful.  This product should be taken off the market immediately.  They did absolutely nothing for my 2-yr old dog's teeth.  I gave him about 4 per week until he almost choked to death on about the 10th one.  Awful. dangerous product. simple as that.
34354,B001P3NU30,A957NPF67P47S,Denise C. Lewis,0/0,1339977600,Great way to clean teeth,These chews keep my dog's teeth looking great.  He loves the flavor and gets excited when he sees the bag.
34357,B001P3NU30,A1SD9N3FI1M15W,Joseph J Chou,0/0,1338249600,Great chews. be careful,These chews work great for my dog.  I think the value and quality is a great deal on Amazon.<br /><br />Now on to the scary reviews about them being a choking hazard.  I was worried myself as my dog is an aggressive eater.  She inhales her dog food in less than a minute at her feedings and I was worried she would do the same with this item.  She does not. she chews it completely and really takes her time.  I can see how it works as a teeth cleaning agent as she can get about 5-10 minutes of chewing on it until she is finished.<br /><br />Because I never want to see it become a choking hazard I do only let her eat these in my presence and do not leave them as a treat when I leave in her crate.  Each dog will be different. so maybe buy a tester chew at a local store before investing in a bag of 30.
34364,B001P3NU30,AT8FWA2FRMGYZ,M. Bourke,0/0,1334361600,We love these chews!,With any rawhide type of chew there can be some risk to choking. Monitor your dog while he is brushing his teeth and you should be all set. I also like these chews because they don't have any of that bizarre doggy antiseptic chemical in them. Just the enzymes. thank you very much!
34388,B001P3NU30,ATCTS4SXJNHKB,Joseph P. Valenti,0/0,1316217600,C.E.T. Enzymatic Chews,My dog rates this product a five. He loves them and they seem to help clean his teeth. I give him one a day.
34391,B00025664W,A32X5P241BQQRF,D. Hoskins zookeeperX,1/1,1276646400,God's Gift to Fish Folk,This is miracle stuff!<br /><br />I've used it for years and have completely stopped 'searching' for anything else and even moreso - have stopped 'TRYING' anything else.<br /><br />This stuff cleans. clears. de-yellows. de-greens. and even helps alleviate certain disease issues before (and even after) they've started.  I've found this much less stressful on the fish when dealing with a 'dirty or diseased or medicated' fish tank. Changing the water (especially after meds) can sometimes create such a harmful blow on the fish... whereas this is so much more gentle on the fish; thus allowing a water change after-the-fact without the incredible stress or damage to delicate fish. Even if you're in need of adding meds. I've found this a fabulous 'pre-intervention' -- why. because many times this need only occurs due to lack of proper maintenance of the tank. By alleviating the 'nasties' before a small water change + adding meds; I personally have found this a lifesaver when it comes to those fish in 'not-to-happy' condition. I've seen many die. but I've seen less die when using this in combination of meds and H2O changes. Obviously. you're call.... but if you're looking for a helpful moment in time --this be it!!!<br /><br />Additionally. should one have issues with water quality. even after changing the water -- this will absolutely fix it!!! I still recommend however to start with this first (you'd be amazed at what clarity can occur while at work for even only 8 hours).<br /><br />If you have never used this stuff. I promise you. this WILL produce miracles beyond any fishkeepers expectations.<br /><br />Your fish will thank you!!! You will thank you!!<br /><br />This stuff is the 'bee's knees'.<br />it's the 'holy grail'.<br />it be the ying to any fish's yang!!<br /><br />You will never be sorry you purchased it.<br />It's worth every penny!<br />... that is. as long as the deals here don't suddenly change.<br />If so. as always. we the people shall figure out what it's made out of and then just wholesale penny it from an alt manufacturer.<br /><br />AND. this IS a DEAL! [...] has always strived to be one of the best priced places online... and here. they found their niche even moreso! I buy from them regularly. and shall continue. They 'quick ship'. they honor their prices. and are happy to fix any faux pas.<br /><br />You just can't go wrong with:<br />1) this gift from 'the gods'. and<br />2) buying anything from [...]<br /><br />I swear by this product and have yet to find anything else in 9 years of fishkeeping that even comes close to the miracle of this product.<br />.... yes Virginia - there is a Santa Fish somewhere out there and his name is PolyFilter!!!
34396,B001ET5XWG,A2VFCUC88UKI0D,J. Beckman ingenue,6/7,1195084800,couldn't live without it!,This pesto paste is so incredibly convenient. tasty. and versatile. As someone who suffers from dairy sensitivity. I was enthused to find a GOOD VEGAN pesto product! This is coming from someone who is an authentic Italian who grew up on homemade goods. Maybe the previous users who disliked it weren't using good. quality olive oil? Just a thought. It makes the sauce. It's SO MUCH better than cheese-laden commercial crap...
34414,B0026NOQG8,A2VVASHDH74CXY,lesnik Les,1/1,1278460800,Very easy to use,Just be aware that you need to add flavor to this with foods or flavored oils and you will like it a lot. Very easy to use.

Strong enough for the larger size cup choices without getting too weak like some of the flavored coffees do and yet not so extra bold that you can't bear it.  A nice option when you don't want flavor.
34429,B008FHUDW0,AE8D0IW1ULZFR,MommyM,0/0,1298592000,Delicious!!,Takes like a sweet/mellow breakfast blend to me. I was drinking the Tully's Kona Blend. but I like this much better. I use the 2nd tallest cup setting on my Keurig so it's not too concentrated.

When I first ordered it I was hoping it would have a nice full taste. and not. for a lack of a better word. diluted flavor.  I was not disappointed. Not to say this tasted burnt like some coffee.  I'm really enjoying it and will order some more when the time comes.

Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula worked quite well for us. but we could tell that our pug was looking for some variety so we tried their Sweet Potato and Venison formula.<br /><br />According to the Natural Balance web site. some dogs develop sensitivities to commonly used proteins. carbohydrates. and food additives. This may cause stomach and intestinal problems. as well as skin irritations. In our dog's case. it was his red irritated skin on his belly that led us to try a limited ingredient diet. The Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula combines fresh venison. a source of animal protein that most dogs have not been exposed to. and sweet potato. premium quality carbohydrate rich in potassium and a highly digestible energy source. Other key ingredients include canola oil. low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat. as well as an excellent source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids. along with flaxseed. another quality source of Omega-3 fatty acids. The food is completely grain free (no barley. wheat. rice or corn) and contains no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. My pug is able to eat it easily. although in his case. he pretty much inhales his food and doesn't chew it much. It has a slight meaty smell. which I think he likes. as the Potato and Duck formula didn't seem to have much of an enticing scent.<br /><br />My local specialty pet food store tells me this is 1 selling dog food. I can see why! Our pug continues to do well with this LID formula. just like he did with Potato & Duck. His skin shows no sign of redness and irritation. and just as importantly. it appears to agree well with his stomach. He doesn't get gassy and his stool is not loose or showing any other signs of intestinal distress. It also appears to keep his appetite under control as he doesn't beg for so many treats between meals and doesn't start asking for dinner so early as he did with some other foods in the past. If it keeps him happy and itch-free. then we're happy. too. 5 stars.
34587,B000GQTP1S,A1OS5S77DB9KJ4,David Lieu,4/4,1282435200,SPICY!!!,These chips are bomb!!! You can feel the heat on the first chip. I love spicy food and I can eat a whole bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos no problem. but I need something to drink after about ten of these chips. Probably the hottest chips I have eaten so far. I paid $30 something bucks for 14 bags. no regrets! If there is anything hotter and better tasting. please let me know.
34595,B000GQTP1S,A3J171NBGIBYAW,D. Mansfield Book Addict,1/1,1288569600,YUM!,I LOVE these. But. be warned. they are CALIENTE! Even though my lips turned red and my nose bleed from the first bag. I went back for more and more and more! There are awesome; just not for the weak of taste buds. :)

I got addicted and kept searching for them again and again. but they must have been on a trial run. never to return.  Amazon fortunately had them. but in palette sized orders rather than a couple bags.  Oh well.  This is simply the most nuclear. face napalm. gastro grenading potato chip I have ever had.  If you're a sadistic snack aficionado like me. try these.  A half bag into it. you will be paying the price.
34611,B000GQTP1S,A3RIB2HANFHZBI,parts papa,0/0,1323216000,Great Chips !!,These chips are a great kettle chip with good crunch and excellent taste. The after burn isn't for everyone ( watch the reaction from people that don't like a little heat!!! ). but it isn't unbearable. Great with sandwiches or by themselves. I buy them by the case and give a bag to friends.

The recipe for making my own chewed up the little can of dry mustard in one use. The price for the little can again means honey mustard is too expensive. With these sized cans I will be making lots of mustard variatons without breaking the bank. My first batch matures in one week. Just in time for basball and hot dogs.

The only complaint is that the Earl Gray & English Breakfast K-Cups look just alike except for the name of the tea.  It would be so much easier if they made the tops different colors.
34699,B004772OUG,A3BISKM8CCYXT4,C. A. Ragone,0/0,1298246400,Hearty and bold,Very good tea.  Very hardy tea taste.  Tastes like it has seeped for several minutes.  I recommend.
34707,B004FWYAYG,A1G29MRK4U08F1,Ramkumar Balaraman,0/0,1341273600,Tastes good. has a smooth texture. but a rubbery consistency,I'm using this with the Presto Flip Belgian waffle maker. This is my second mix after Carbon's Golden Malted Flour. The latter requires more prep time and is more bland. but turns out with a perfect fluffy consistency on the inside with a light crust on the outside. I like the blandness too since it gives a blank slate to work with when adding nuts. blueberries. bananas. etc. I wanted to try this Heartland Mix for mornings when we have less time to work with. and because I love chocolate (who doesn't?!).<br /><br />I really liked the smooth texture that the waffles turned out with. They looked more professional than the Carbon mix which had a slightly mottled surface. The taste was pretty good too. But the waffles themselves were very rubbery and you had to work harder to chew them. I did let the mix rest for 20 minutes so I doubt that's the issue. Maybe I got a bad mix? Maybe I needed to wait a little longer? I'm not sure. I will revise this rating if I find out I missed something. As it is. the consistency is not going to work for us.<br /><br />I found that I could salvage the mix by adding 1 part to every 3 parts of Carbon's.
34736,B0039KF3IM,ANDV4K1ZJXDOY,Ms. Blake,1/1,1344556800,So Good! Crunchy. Chewy. Love to dunk them!,Love these little cookies! They are crunchy with the almonds. chewy with the little raisins and are not too sweet. I enjoy them with coffee and tea. I discovered them at the local Wal-mart a few weeks ago. They sold out last week (maybe I bought them all!) and have not restocked so I went looking on the internet for them. Voila! Amazon has them plus a few more flavors from the same company!  I ordered these and the the Ginger. These are still my favorite.<br /><br />The packaging was good - maybe too good - the box was twice as big as the volume of the cookies and had those air-filled plastic bubbles filling up the void. I am pleased my cookies arrived in good shape but not sure all that packaging was needed.
34739,B0039KF3IM,A3J39RV0LQHXCP,LindaPage,0/0,1348012800,Long time favorite,I owned a natural foods store for many years. and these cookies were one of our best sellers. Everybody loves them. They are wholesome. stay crisp. and are great car cookies for road trips... because they don't get stale. and don't crumble all over the car.

I discovered these little gems near the chips isle at my nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store. Somersaults. Hmmmm. Pacific Sea Salt. Crunchy nuggets baked with sunflower seeds and toasted grains. How could I resist? Into the cart it went.<br /><br />These little thingies are really good! Rich sunflower seed taste and very tasty. They're about the size of a thick quarter and they chew up real easily. Delicious taste. or did I already mention that? They have a nice salty taste. but aren't particularly high in sodium. How do they do that? They're high in fiber and protein. the fat calories are high. but it's the good fat. No trans-fats or cholesterol. Man. these are an excellent snack! I'm going to eat too many!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
34748,B0025UON1A,ALU8RT25JPQLH,J. K. Jackson Jkj,5/5,1307232000,Yum!,What more needs be said??  I purchased this cautiously because I was tentative about it being TOO salty but then I thought about the corporation that makes it. Maruchan® and bought it since Maruchan® completely ROCKs when it comes to udon meals.<br /><br />Oh my gracious sakes alive is it good.  It helps to immerse the vegetables in the water - but that's MY fault.<br /><br />Yay!  I'm not sure YOUR taste but I LOVE my boxes of Maruchan®!!

34769,B004T33F2O,AKZKG2Z7CNV27,BreezyPaige,0/0,1332806400,Absolutely Awful Cat Food,I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food. but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal. corn gluten meal. and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically. corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full. poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box). and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product. its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks. chicken feet. eyeballs. even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone. for any reason. ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix. as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive. your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food. because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat. and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense. meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet. many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food. the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for. I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo. Halo. Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real. whole meats that I myself would eat. with no added fillers or corn.
34784,B000I1RHMU,A3VGB141KEL3CC,b.t. moose,0/3,1210982400,Wrong shipments,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
34794,B000I1RHMU,A1YGCU0QQKZC29,Yvette,3/3,1220659200,Great tea that is also good for you!,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
34816,B000I1RHMU,A2X2G8ME9TS9Y0,B's Mom,1/1,1305417600,Wow!,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
34818,B000I1RHMU,A3LQS08K2OBI5Z,J. Lim,1/1,1298332800,Tastes exactly like regular Stash Green Tea,I was worried this was going to taste less than green coffee. or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense. much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda. etc.. would. but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea. but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!
34821,B000I1RHMU,A42QN9MM6LKKM,Lee in Kansas City,1/1,1286668800,This is a staple at my house,I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that. however. when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ>Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler. Variety Pack of Eight Flavors. Tea Bags. 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me. but was wrong.  Yes. I do enjoy the options. but even so. was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy. such as first thing in the morning. or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of tea time. where black tea was daily served at 4 pm.. and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew). but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste. which carries the familiar acidic bite of black tea. but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others. I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo. wondering what to expect.  Now. however. I can say to anyone considering it. that if you like Earl Grey tea. then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me. the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently. I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug. which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea. being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so. I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put. it hits the spot.  Anyway. teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only). and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the subscribe & save option. this is an especially good deal.
34838,B000I1RHMU,A2DLHG0J2PX9YB,B,0/0,1326412800,Wonderful,Fantastic product. just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting. nice that its organic.

If you're feeling hip. you could go down to your local shopping mall. go inside a Teavana store. and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or. you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.

34920,B002DLXXHG,A3QN4XB6Q7TEIY,LaZyGuN,0/0,1284681600,Good. but not great,If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky. you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me. I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main brands out there. This bag. has a LOT of beef jerky. and it is somewhat soft. However. it isn't like chewy/tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it. but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious.

First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great. 2nd and 3rd batches too over-flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong/salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product.
35029,B002DLXXHG,A288XUYT5OXPBQ,Omar Diab Sebastian,1/1,1290556800,Pretty good jerky.,This jerky was decent.  The softness of the pieces were in general pretty good. a little on the hard time sometimes but overall soft enough to chew comfortably.  They do vary a little bit within the bag so some pieces may be a bit too hard. but usually they don't get too soft.  The Sweet and Hot flavor tasted pretty good; so did the Teriyaki.  I'd recommend both!
35030,B002DLXXHG,AWPGDLABUKRQ8,wbc1228,1/1,1287446400,Not Made for Human Consumption,Do not buy Wild Ride Beef Jerky. I purchased two bags of this jerky and they both ended up in the trash. I know Beef Jerky is supposed to be somewhat jerky but Wild Ride takes it to another level. Half the pieces are not edible. Maybe they should advertise this as bubble gum instead of jerky? The taste is OK. average at best. I think the only good thing about this product is the price. It is cheaper than most of the other brands out there. However. if price is what you're going for. go chew on some spare tires that are in the junkyard. What is sad is that rubber tires are probably more chewable than Wild Ridge Beef Jerky. Seriously. don't buy this brand.

I got barbecue and teriyaki.<br /><br />Taste is great. it was very fresh and flavorful. and the jerky was the perfect tenderness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Well. the barbecue. Now the Teriyaki. that's another story. Very bland flavor. tasted like regular beef jerky that was thrown in some teriyaki sauce for a few minutes before packaging. definitely nowhere near the quality of the bbq. Same great tenderness though. I can't wait to try the other flavors. :D

I threw most of this away. The taste is really off. The texture was way too soft. Almost fell apart in your mouth. I noticed that the beef did not come from USA per the package. Makes me wonder what kind of beef they are shipping in to dry. Is it old and rotten? Is it even beef? Sure doesn't tast like any beef jerkey I'm used to. Yuck.

We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there. and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive. not to mention gleaming review.  Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed. but their packaging used to say all natural. but NO MORE. because they know it is not.  Now it says  naturally hickory smoked. or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags. and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag. you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy. others will be nothing but rubber. some with thick tendons running through. and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags. especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).<br /><br />i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency. but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range. here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk. but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.<br /><br />OH. and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well.  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package.
35066,B002DLXXHG,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,Derek G,2/3,1261440000,Decent taste. cheap meat,I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better. unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them. most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally. the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible. but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.
35067,B002DLXXHG,A18PE8KT64Y4UL,Y. Sim,2/3,1259625600,Moldy meat.,I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio. you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However. the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly. some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However. my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white. it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.
35069,B004SKPRI8,A2WSCV0AM35CK,L. Patterson,1/1,1324512000,Baby LOVES these little gems!!,My daughter is 13 months old. has been eating these for a few months now and absolutely LOVES them. both flavors. I wish they made more flavors. not that my daughter cares which flavor she gets. she gobbles them both up! If she sees the bag in the cupboard she goes crazy and says more (in sign language) and literally says snack. If given the opportunity she would get the whole bag. lol. I wish I discovered them earlier then I did. I say that the package said toddler so I thought she couldn't have it. but they are just like the yogurt melts to where they are easily chewable. if your child can chew food then these will be just fine. in my opinion.
35100,B001FA1LL6,A348LXR41XVVEZ,Jerry Digilio,0/0,1305590400,Good stuff,I use these beans in an espresso machine. I love the taste of straight espresso coffee but find that too much caffeine stresses me out. This coffee tastes great as an espresso. I subscribe to this coffee through Amazon and receive an order each month at a 15% discount with free shipping. A good deal.
35117,B0025WB9P6,AWUSTYCHK6WH6,matt new york,0/2,1337212800,where is the apple concentrate from? China or USA?,I usually buy Mott's apple juice but now that they have started labeling their product with Concentrate from china I think I will look elsewhere. China has too many cases of adulterated food products.
35133,B0012LAFG0,A3QU2MONU6M7GA,D. Rossi,1/1,1241568000,WOW!,I tried the multigrain and they're fabulous.  I love to dip them in sour cream. I never ate a chip that tasted this good!

35179,B000ED7M1S,AQLL2R1PPR46X,grumpyrainbow,7/7,1182816000,Good,Great tasting buttery beans in huge packages.  I enjoyed them.  I didn't follow the instructions exactly. but just made them as I normally make beans and they came out great.
35197,B001SJR4XS,A2YMS9UK1A9OF2,Jeff,1/1,1344384000,A stout cup of coffee! Oh Yeah!,I like the Kicking Horse brand of coffees and Three Sisters is my usual all-day choice. There comes a time when one needs a bit more power to start the day and 454 Horse Power totally punches the starter! The full body & flavor with low acidity is true. There is no burnt sox smell to these beans. Its a dark and rich blend with excellent flavor. I have tried several cans of the Kick Ass Dark with no complaints but no real bonding either. The 454 Horse Power Dark is perfect for when a richer. darker. brew with wake-up!! powers is needed! The beans are nicely dark-roasted & fresh. My 454HP is med coarse ground as needed and done in a french press - yes. I want all the oils & flavors possible! It should provide serious espresso too. Normally. I don't use added condiments to my coffee. but 454HP will be fine for those wanting sugar or cream. I've placed 454HP into subscription!
35221,B001SJR4XS,A3PS7RPE1Q6NAR,Cece,0/1,1341792000,Worth the money. Refreshing change.,This was a tad  bit spendy. but worth it for the change of pace. My only quibble is that it took an extra day or two to arrive. I think it's a Canadian product??? Anyway. fun name. smooth rich cup. nice finish.

35246,B003Y7DS64,A3BFDEBT5IV4UN,Groucho,0/0,1320019200,Tasty Alternative,This brand of chips has been my favorite since I found them down in Pennsylvania when I used to travel that way.  A few years ago they started to sell them in New England and I was thrilled!  I've been buying them weekly since they made there appearance.<br /><br />But now I found I have entered those years were I have to watch my salt intake and the first thing to go was my beloved chips.  I have been depressed.  UNTIL I found quit by accident via Amazon that Herr's makes a lower salt chip.  And it is delicious.  I have been buying  <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052Y7YL2>Lay's Lightly Salted Potato Chips 10 oz</a> and while they are good. they are not GREAT like Herr's.  The Lay's taste and appearance can be inconsistent. you may find overly greasy chips one day and  unsalted ones the next.  And you never find those good slightly browned ones.<br /><br /> Herr's is consistently tasty. has some browner ones mixed in and you may even find some with skin on the edge of the chips. They are truly delicious and to be able to get them from the comfort of my home while still in my PJ's isd a treat.  And these chips are a treat I can't pass up.
35280,B007FRD4BI,A37TWDTPQ892RT,Lexander,0/0,1345420800,YUMMY!,Great stuff and soooooo good! I purchased this for my wifes new diet but I am drinking it more than she is! It is delicious and smells great! A must buy folks.

35301,B002DVVP6W,A2R2536GOJ6R97,M. J. MacDonald,0/0,1337040000,Too salty!,I've purchased the Santa Fe Salsa flavor before and these were pretty tasty. so I had high hopes for Salty Pepper. Sadly. they are disgustingly salty. As in I only managed to eat two of them before I had to go look for my water bottle. Bleh!
35310,B002DVVP6W,AUP630LU3WQ,Jennifre,0/0,1306800000,Nuts/seeds. a bit of spice. delicious!!  I love these...,I was absolutely delighted when I just accidentally tried these at a Caribou lately. but... I LOVE them!!<br /><br />A delicious cracker of sorts. made mostly with sunflower seeds and other seed-nut-type things. though they do have a fairly standard cracker carb load. which is unfortunate. If a bit lower on carbs (I think it's somewhere around 14-16g per small (2 oz?) bag. they might well be the only thing I eat [besides eggs. and lettuce].<br /><br />I really. really love these things! The combination of salt/pepper on snacks. I find irresistible. and on these healthy. nut/seed snacks... way better than potato chips! While there IS something cardboard ish about their texture (could be what the negative review is referencing). to me similar to [Va-]Nilla Wafers and Saltines. both classics. the flavor of these salt/pepper Somersaults is killer-delicious. I tried another flavor at Caribou but didn't enjoy it at all. though the salt/pepper. well. I personally can't stop eating them. I buy them anytime I see them and am sad they're not at my local grocery.<br /><br />I'm very. very excited to have found them here. and can't wait to receive them!!!  :)
35326,B003LXRO48,AVXPRZQXQL08L,Reido freezin',0/0,1301961600,Pom loves them,Well. Petco vs. Petsmart aside. these are really good at cleaning my Pom's teeth and she doesn't react poorly to them like some other treats she's had designed for oral care.  I don't expect anything like this to eliminate the need for a teeth cleaning. which Poms need at least annually...but the teeth look much better after only one package of 24.
35332,B000EMOD4I,A2HKU4SOT0CWG9,Susan C. Wolfe Nutty Librarian,1/1,1254355200,Just love them!,I love the Cinnamon Streusel Muffin mix! You can make muffins. scones or coffee cake with the mix! It bakes easily. It is just yummy!
35345,B000GW46D4,A3Q816H5AFX2SB,J. Luk Techie,1/1,1263254400,Like licking a salt cube! 1470mg of Sodium!,After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks. I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty. stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package. which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day.
35347,B000GW46D4,A1YYT9PM8PNFI8,Michael Plechaty Mike,1/1,1244764800,Tastes great and not loaded with corn syrup or sugar,These jerky packs are great.  They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies.  I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup.  I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring.  Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.  Keep up the good work Jack Link.

35358,B000GW46D4,A2Y4S4CNGKF21S,H. Swanson,0/0,1332374400,Very dry. kinda crumbly :\,I was pretty disappointed with this. It's incredibly dry. to the point of being almost crumbly in your mouth. I also thought the flavor itself could have been better.  I've made jerky myself that tastes much better than this.
35362,B000GW46D4,A2PVHEQQH592ZN,Michael Martin,0/0,1328227200,Eww,These things are terrible.  They have a waxy coating and some sort of chemical on top.  The taste of the chemical is very prominent.  I can't even give these things away.
35394,B000GW46D4,AZYMD9P9F9UZ6,W. Coombe,0/0,1238630400,Good Jerky,I like the peppered flavor a lot better than the original or plain. it does have a good cracked pepper flavor. I also think the quality is better than most other brands that I have tried. I prefer the 1 oz. packaged.
35395,B000GW46D4,A3DTSH9W8K6BP4,Michael Lerew Iron-Mike,0/0,1234656000,Great for gym rats..,This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat. it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy. I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next.
35403,B000GW46D4,A1WNGKUT3O644D,Bonnie S. Seybert Bonnie,0/0,1206057600,Burst of flavor,I love Jack Links Beef Steak and this has to top them all. I only ordered 1 box and will definately order more.

At last. I had discovered something useful and affordable to give as gifts to loved ones who had everything.  After scouring the website. I eventually chose this brand because of the price.  However. my in laws claim that it is very good indeed so the low price is an added bonus.  They have been thrilled with a neverending supply of the beverage since we can afford to send them the tea in our care packages that go out every few weeks.

Not only does it taste great but it brings back memories of when I was stationed in Germany. I have one big question though. Do I need to keep it in the refrigerator after I open it? This is the first time I buy this mustard in this tube packaging. Usually I get it in a jar. Can anyone help me out with this question. The seller shipped it on time and everything but I didn't see a phone number to contact them directly with this question.

If you are a person who has blood pressure issues and you are looking for a salt free spicy seasoning then this is perfect. I use this without adding salt and it taste great. It is spicy but not too spicy or over powering.

These gourmet flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!

Jiffy bran muffins are my kids absolute favorite and we're in a crisis because I can no longer find them at my local supermarkets.  They are very easy to bake. smell great and make nice little 'lunch box stuffers'.  I add cinnamon and an all-bran cereal to the mix (along with a little extra milk) to extend the mix and make them even more nutritious.  They're great from the oven warm with a pat of butter. with your favorite marmalade or NAKED!  Try them for the whole family. instead of cookies or pastries.

35633,B0036UQTQA,AY3XPKRAMKKY7,C. G. King,1/1,1347580800,New label. same great stuff,A favorite outing among Detroiters was a trip to Sanders and often that meant a hot fudge sundae made with their signature sauce.  It's a combination of chocolate and caramel and simply heavenly.  Although the original Sanders no longer exists. the company that purchased them knew a good thing and has continued to make this yummy topping.  For those of us who do not live in Michigan anymore it's awfully nice to be able to get this treat on Amazon.  Before I discovered that. I tried various grocery store and gourmet versions of the chocolate/caramel combination. but they are just not right.  This sauce warms beautifully in the microwave and pours over your ice cream or cream puff just as hot fudge should.  It doesn't harden but cools on the sundae to a more caramelly texture. And if you can't wait you can eat it by the spoonful right out of the jar :).  I always have great ideas for using it with a special waffle dessert or topping a cheesecake. but it never seems to last that long around here.<br /><br />I don't need to recommend it to folks from or in Michigan. but to others it can turn simple vanilla ice cream into a dessert that will leave your guests wanting to know how you created such an unusual and delicious topping--and asking for more.  Great stuff.

Roberts,0/1,1284249600,Flat,I love several of the other Santa Cruz Organic sodas (Lemon/Lime & Pomegranate/Lime are awesome). but I don't care for this one at all. It has a root beer flavor. but something isn't right about it. It has lemon juice in it which seems odd to me. but I think the biggest problem is the low amount of carbonation.  Even a freshly cooled can tastes like it's been left open all day and then put back in the refridge.  The less carbonation works great in their fruity drinks. but not this one.  Also. at a 130 calories per can. you will not get skinny drinking this stuff.

Then I get a larger bowl and pour everything into it. add some hot sauce. and sit down for a filling and delicious lunch.<br /><br />Plus the bowls are useful too. I keep some in the art corner for various projects & water while the kids paint. and I keep some in the kitchen to use for short-term storage while cooking or to store small amounts of food overnight in the fridge.<br /><br />While Ramen has a soft spot in my heart for getting me through college. Thai Kitchen noodles are my favorite.

35688,B0051OPWGC,ABDCYK04CL6O4,MIDNIGHT0521,0/0,1323993600,PEPPERIDGE FARM COOKIES. Mmmmmmmm,What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked. milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot. since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands. it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5. for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past. so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review. then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now. Mmmmm!

35706,B00020UGN4,A3T3KPW2QE866W,leelee,25/27,1128384000,Heavenly chocolate,Outstanding melt in your mouth chocolate.  The dark chocolate is not bitter like many chocolatiers - it has the perfect blend of taste for any chocoholic.  I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the Mercedes-Benz of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory. milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it's medium grade quality.
35707,B00020UGN4,A1WXO06S5WQUTS,M. Wernow Heironymus de Medina,19/20,1128124800,Creme de Creme,I lived in Leuven. Belgium for 8 years and tried many a chocolate.  Leonidas is the creme de creme. that is. the best of the best.  Especially their Framboise Praline is an Epicurean delight if you are a dark chocolate lover.  Also. their plain dark chocolate medallion is outstanding as an addition to a freshly brewed Tully's espresso.  Amazon. you provide a number one global service by bringing the best of Belgium to the US.  Thanx.<br /><br />Heironymus de Medina (aka Jerome)
35708,B00020UGN4,A1VC64SY1FXCLY,Liuba Beauvais,7/7,1157068800,Simply The Best,These chocolates are much better than 5 stars!<br /><br />We found a Leonidas' Shop during a visit to Brussels. Belgium earlier this year and brought home 4 of the kilo Assortment Ballotins.  I was ready to call directly to Brussels to place an order for more. but found them in New York City. so.........no need to search further.<br /><br />The quality is outstanding and as other have already stated. far superior to other brands and MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE.<br /><br />The shipment arrives overnight and each ballotin is protected in it's own styrofoam case.<br /><br />Try an assortment (the dark is unbelievably decadent) and you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Enjoy
35736,B00020UGN4,AM6U0HPEQ4JUV,Asa,0/0,1252713600,Consistently excellent service,I've been ordering Leonidas Chocolates for gifts for nearly five years and I've been completely satisfied every single time.
35743,B00020UGN4,A1XYW8TT0MMZ6V,Gerald Merritt,1/2,1320192000,Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment,I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild. not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So. here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position. but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet. I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.
35744,B00020UGN4,A1V7NO21SZPFMS,Stephen Thomas,2/4,1194825600,Okay. but.....,I've read reviews of different chocolates on Consumer Reports awhile ago and Leonidas was given a good rating; I was curious as to how this would taste.  So. I ordered it for the family (I just sampled..).  The packaging is really nice.. it would make a great gift.  As for the chocolate itself. well... it is better than most store brands. but not as good as Godiva.  I would rather pay a little more for better quality. or pay a lot less for a bar of Cadbury.

35800,B00290W1CY,A2NLL7LY4V74TC,Kinky Ninja -X-,8/9,1325203200,Flashback to childhood anyone?,I'm currently working in Afghanistan for a private military contractor. I ordered a box of these bad boys on a whim and they arrived in a blur! What did I do next? I stuck that stuff in the FREEZER dude!!! 24 hour later I was in popsicle heaven bro. Grapes my favorite;) Since this box has 200 assorted flavors I tossed a bunch in a plastic bag and went around my base handing them out! Needless to say a free popsicle on a hot Afghan day will brighten anyones mood:)
35802,B00290W1CY,A3KM0RCLWV6260,Debbie N,0/27,1317168000,Sent as a gift -- never acknowledged,I sent this item as a gift to Chimphaven.  It was on their wish list.  Have never heard from them so am not sure it was ever received.  Probably would not order online again from you all.
35810,B001DTFRXM,A2TSGQCMJ5WUY,J Chahla,0/0,1336780800,Yummy and Good for You...,Tastes very good. and helps in healing my upset stomach and heart burns.<br />I going back for more...for sure.<br />They are lucky Down-Under.

35823,B000LKXJEI,AG5FWTUPJPY51,Tami,1/2,1307836800,Spoiled Vegan,A sweet barbecue moist chewy jerky that makes it difficult to keep 24 strips around for very long.  You'll be spoiled.
35846,B000LKXJEI,AS8B1BPUTP6AR,Amber,1/7,1299196800,Don't Buy. Nothing like Teriyaki Jerky,I became a vegetarian about three years ago. and before that. Teriyaki was my favorite flavor of beef jerky. So when I saw this. I immediately bought it. However. this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy. and tasted like bread. and the supposed Teriyaki flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it. so I'm returning it. If you buy. I guarantee you'll be sorry.
35848,B000LKXJEI,A3N5SKXEA0NN57,Light,0/12,1240185600,IF you like this. just try tasty east Soy Jerky,First. a bunch of us tried this product. but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And. we found out it has granulated garlic. possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to spices. Here it is part of the vegetarian spices ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway. we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger. teriyaki. original. peppered. hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality. texture and flavor. In fact. we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki. original and many other flavors. But. we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it. it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more. no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare.
35858,B000LKXJEI,A195135207HS76,R. Hubbard,3/3,1236124800,absolutely delicious,Vegan or not. teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive. as far as that goes.  But you cannot go wrong on flavor and texture.  These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far.
35863,B000LKXJEI,A22I7MDM7F462C,JACharron,2/2,1345248000,I'm torn...but I'm still eating them.,I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie). but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package. and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor. but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out. and that worked fine. but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good. and I do like them. but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.
35876,B000LKXJEI,A2CH6FUYGYDV4I,J. G. Kerns,1/1,1317254400,Yummy. even to an carni/omnivore,I'm an avowed omnivore.  I love me some jerky. too.  Meat in all forms. really.  An exchange with an old girlfriend summed it up quite well... You know. you don't have to eat meat every day. she said. My response was stunned silence.  The point?  These are darned tasty to a meat-lover like myself.  Not just these. but the entire line (that I've tried so far).<br /><br />No. you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat-like. despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it. anyway?!).  However. it does have a satisfying chew. and unlike real jerky. you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky. these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh. they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.  And they do a pretty good job on the flavoring. too!<br /><br />Bottom line: it ain't meat. but it's amazing for a plant!
35879,B000LKXJEI,A4QZ8I8ZINQGX,Lindsay,1/1,1302998400,AMAZING,This is just simply delicious! I have so far tried the Texas BBQ and the Mesquite Lime and I can't describe how tasty it is! I've never had real beef jerky before so the only way I could see someone giving this a bad review. is if it doesn't taste how someone would expect but whatever it taste like believe me. it's delicious! The jerky is not dry. because they seal in the perfect amount of sauce so its not wet. but moist!<br /><br />The particular packages I tried however looked different than the picture amazon has here so I'm not sure if Primal Spirit has changed their marketing recently and these are old pictures. or if when you order it. it will actually look like the picture shown. If you go to their website. the pictures on the website are exactly what I purchased from Whole Foods. I'd love to buy them online for the convenience but. I'd like to be sure they are the same packaging and not an older version<br /><br />Anyway. great product! Hope to try all the flavors soon!
35882,B000LKXJEI,A4OKY9RZ5VR7N,D. Hogan,1/1,1267920000,primalspirit meatless jerky-wow!,Have tried most of the flavors and can't say anything bad about any I've tasted. The Teriyaki and Hickory Smoked are my personal favorites. For 99 calories you get 11 Gms. of protein and great taste. Add an apple and/or salad and you've got a full. small meal. Price is good. too.
35904,B000LKXJEI,A10QVHHPD3GY6R,moose_angel,0/0,1337212800,The Best I've Found So Far,Okay. these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky. and so far. these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list). and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist. almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat. but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top. so in theory. you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately. it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously. these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!
35919,B000LKXJEI,AMEMYZC3GEE1K,Meli J,0/0,1303603200,The best protein snack,I am vegan and just came across this product not too long ago. It is the BEST snack. I've tried different flavors and I tend to like the Texas BBQ ones the best. The texture is just like meat and its healthier for you.
35926,B000LKXJEI,A33TRG3THX7Y2I,M. Bolden,0/0,1286150400,Pretty good,My husband loves these.  They are pretty good.  They are moist so they are not like real jerky in that sense but otherwise the texture is very similar.  I wish they had a variety that wasn't so sweet but I definitely recommend trying some before getting an entire package - luckily I got to try each of them. which are all good.
35932,B000LKXJEI,A1CIU572HUUE5A,Andrew Gorman Andy,0/0,1255564800,Fantastic,I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein. 2g fat. 8g carbs.). The Thai Peanut variety is very tasty with a little bit of a kick. The texture is firm. which I enjoy. but it typically gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy.
35944,B0085G4A7U,A23RP7CYE4WRO0,Geo,0/0,1348358400,Fantastic drink,This drink has been the best thing I've found for<br />Quenching my thirst after a workout.<br />This drink has been the best thing I've found for<br />Quenching my thirst after a workout.

35960,B0085G4A7U,AGXQRV98SWUFO,DMB btrue,5/9,1245110400,great for yoga!,I just received my 12 pack of Acai Pomegranate Vita Coco Coconut Water from Amazon.<br /><br />Wow!! I love the new twist off cap!! I have been waiting for Vita Coco to come out with a more user friendly packaging (to work out with). Now I can go to yoga and open and close my drink. that way I can have some throughout my practice. Unlike water. Vita Coco keeps me hydrated and gives me the potassium and electrolytes I need while working out. The incorporation of acai with coconut water is delicious! The combination of nutrients. amino acids. antioxidants. vitamins and other properties make acai one of the wonders of the natural food kingdom!<br /><br />Now the yoga studios I go to. even carry Vita Coco (for the times I do not have one on hand!) I will definitely spread the word of this amazing hydration drink!
35981,B000AEWGBM,AL0XBGUHGE9XD,K. Galyen,4/5,1202947200,Peppermint POW!,Anyone I've ever given these peppermint teabags to always exclaim how pepperminty they are! The bags are definitely super-jumbo and it smells so fresh. Once you have these. you probably won't be satisfied with other peppermint teas again.
35982,B000AEWGBM,A30Z63HV0NUD,K. A. McGuire,1/1,1331510400,Exceptional Tea,I have tried many many many peppermint and mixed mint teas. This one is the very best. you cannot get any better than this. Upon opening the canister you're hit with a powerful sweet peppermint fragrance. When you're drinking it. it's calming and soothing. melting away stress ... just making you feel better whether or not you suffer with IBS or any digestive issues - this tea is perfect for everyone. Yum yum yum!
35988,B000AEWGBM,AZQELQZI3I2RC,Jean Coltrain,0/0,1317945600,A Wonderful Tea!,This is a delicious tea that really works to settle my stomach.  I have never really liked herbal teas so was rather skeptical. but I loved this from the first sip.  It's very flavorful.
36040,B001ACMCNA,AUR9V9FCNNCMK,Janet Barnard,0/0,1337299200,Great gluten free pizza crust!,We have found that if we don't put in the optional 1 cup of cheese the crust is crisper.  We roll the dough as thin as we can (if it sticks to the counter we rub a little olive oil on the counter) and then put it in the oven for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  Then add the toppings and put the completed pizza in the oven for 15 minutes.  Chebe bread makes great pizza crust!

My 5 year old ate 3 (my husband. baby and 6 year old ate their fair share too)! Have not had a pizza type product this good since our diagnosis in March 2010. I am a chef and have made a lot of gluten free products since going GF and now cow dairy free (used goat milk mozzarella) and this really is a must buy. Great for the whole family-gluten free or not-it is a true winner!

36069,B0048KEEBE,A2OEUROGZDTXUJ,J. Graves,0/0,1302566400,Safe energy,We (I work at a small grocery store) ordered this item at the suggestion of a customer. When I got around to trying one. WOW! The drink is sweet. but not overly so. and quite ginger-y. I love the taste of ginger. As far as the kick goes. I think it's perfect. Enough to get you going. but not so much that you won't be able to sleep.<br /><br />I have Raynaud's Syndrome. Basically. my hands are always cold. When they become very cold. they hurt pretty badly and turn blue. Temperature and stress are the main bullies to trigger these attacks. Caffeine is not good for me either. as it constricts your blood vessels. For some reason. I can drink this stuff without any bad side effects. This fact and the taste are why I continue to drink Reed's Energy Elixir.
36076,B000T8VYQC,A2LSH89PR6GOQQ,JenMS jenms,0/0,1335484800,Great stuff!,I just got a bottle of this. hoping to use it in cocktails. sodas. etc.  I haven't tried using it as a mixer yet. but I have been just adding it to seltzer water to make an Italian soda (I call it fairy soda for my young nieces).  It is very sweet (which is why I'm deducting one star) and not sure how it would hold up against other flavors. but even simply as a flavor for soda water. it's very refreshing.

(Yes. Rachel. I think you'd love 'em too!)
36165,B000FBQ594,A2BMOZXJXXEKXQ,J. Baars Steelwells,0/3,1167868800,Tasty and different,Please realize that these are not cookies as much as crackers.  They have a sweet taste. but don't expect an oreo as the taste of hazelnut is much more subtle than other tastes.<br /><br />Overall. excellent - I very much enjoyed them!
36180,B000ILKXP8,A268LOQQCRTGUH,Chris Baker,4/4,1254182400,Excellent sauce. milder than the green lid,I was excited to see a new line of Sriracha sauce in my grocery store so I scooped this up the first day I saw it.<br /><br />This sauce is packed with flavor. it is tangy and showcases the flavors of the chili and garlic right out front.  It is not as hot as the Huy Fong Sriracha sauce in the green lid and also has a tangier flavor.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this sauce.
36183,B000ILKXP8,A39UH7E8Z6HXDM,Graig Diamond,0/3,1316649600,Don't be fooled. this isn't Huy Fong,Yes. this looks like the one you want.  It feels like the one you want.  But this isn't the one you want.  You want the one made by Huy Fong.  This one tastes quite off.  Somewhat more garlicky and completely unsatisfying to those who like the real stuff.

I live in a small town. so they are hard to find.  The couple of brands I found were smelly and just okay.  I ordered these off of Amazon and they are DELICOUS!  My husband loves them too and told me to order some more!!!  They are healthy and great and taste good!  I love them and will order more!

36325,B002KAL1B0,A1DHKKNNW6H783,Justbooking,3/4,1329350400,Warning - arsenic found in this type of baby formula,I was looking for a formula for my toddlers and was shocked to learn today that those made with organic brown rice syrup contain particularly high levels of arsenic. compared with products without this syrup.<br /><br />Seventeen baby formulas were tested in the Darmouth College study. According to the Today show. Two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient. These products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas.. The amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank.. arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on.<br /><br />The study. published in Environmental Health Perspectives. indicates that organic infant milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit.<br /><br />The formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that Baby's Only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate. I for one will be passing on this product.

I have been eating a vegan diet for over 20 years. and I can't think of any other vegan egg yolk substitute.  One of the coolest ways to use The Vegg is to make a spherified Vegg yolk.  You can drop a quantity of The Vegg (once mixed with water) into a 1% (by weight) solution of calcium chloride and the liquid will form a ball with a membrane around it - which looks and tastes just like an uncooked egg yolk.  Try placing a spherified Vegg yolk in the center of a ravioli with some tofu ricotta or sweet potato filling - vegan gourmet for sure!  Just this weekend I saw calcium chloride granules on sale at Lowe's - Ball brand packages them for use with canning.  If you want more information about spherification. there is a link to a video at thevegg.com.  Also. if you haven't made french toast with The Vegg - go try it. NOW!

36388,B004CLCEDE,A2PJWCB3TVIKZ,Simcha L. Kuritzky happylion,1/1,1349568000,Good eating but not effective dieting,I like these noodles. They do not have the texture of pasta. but I grew up in Japan often eating osoba with these type of noodles. so it was very familiar. They also taste good with marina sauce and cheese. However. my body is not fooled by them. Less than an hour after eating a package. I'm hungry again. I tried having two packages at once. and I still get hungry. So they're a nice treat. but not helpful in trying to control my calorie intake.
36390,B004CLCEDE,A2QZA035UN5JC6,jlee,1/1,1348012800,These are Amazing,Why doesn't everyone eat these-- no carbs and they add a great filler to your dish -- Super easy to use<br /><br />It's like Ramen noodles with NO GUILT

For non-dieters NO,If you are dieting. and have to count calories.. these noodles are great for what you get.<br />NO they don't taste like pasta. but they do easily take on the taste of what you add to them.<br />The texture is rubbery. but when mixed with a lean cuisine lasagne you won't notice.  Yes they stink<br />when you open the bag... big deal. rinse them well and boil or nuke and drain well. and you won't<br />smell them afterwards.  The real reason for getting these is for meals where you want something like<br />a lean cuisine to make you feel more full.  I have had no nausea or any affects from eating these as<br />some have posted. and I eat two bags at a time.  If you are not on a diet... why in the world would<br />you even buy these. and then post how terrible they are??  For a low calorie diet. these are a great<br />way to curb the appetite when mixed with small portions of tasty foods!
36425,B004CLCEDE,ABX0IXYFKMQLP,Victoria Hanley Seize the Story,1/1,1324080000,Needs a bit of creativity to be palatable,Here's what I've done to incorporate these noodles into a successful weight-loss food:<br /><br />1. Rinse them off in a colander when you open the package--to get rid of the fishy smell.<br />2. Pour boiling water over them.<br />3. Cut them up into short pieces with a knife--otherwise they're really long. and the texture is a bit much.<br />4. Add them to soup or broth and heat well. Use strong seasonings. such as chilis or hot sauce. They aren't all that good at absorbing mild flavors.<br /><br />When I go through all those steps. they're actually not bad tasting. they're quite filling. and the noodles themselves are calorie free.
36436,B004CLCEDE,A1JZN34W5OL152,Patricia,1/1,1314662400,Buy It!,Oh Mi Gosh.  AWESOME!<br /><br />Make sure you rinse well and dry extra well in a paper towel after boiling.  I have tried it with stir fried veggies. (once with frozen) a bit of left over meat. and a favorite salad dressing. once a soy ginger. once an orange citrus.  A quick. filling. almost calorie free. and tasty meal.
36437,B004CLCEDE,A1BIN62363A1X1,Michele,1/1,1314576000,Miracle Noodles...quite impressive!,I ordered my shipment of noodles with some trepidation after reading other reviews on Amazon about them being smelly.  Once I received them. everything was just fine. The noodles did come in very small packets with liquid in them.  It took about three packets of noodles to create a pseudo spaghetti with meat sauce.  The smell after opening the noodles was unpleasant. but not bad enough for me to throw them out.  The odor from the noodles reminded me of something slightly seafood-y smelling.  Once mixed with spaghetti sauce the odor from the noodles was undetectable.  These are an excellent substitute for carb rich noodles and have a similar texture and consistency to the real thing.  I'll definitely be buying them again!
36445,B004CLCEDE,A33D9CLL0TZ1M3,Dan Rivera,1/1,1310342400,Great low-carb option for Asian noodle dishes,Love this product! I'm committed to a low-carb lifestyle and find it easy most of the time. However. there was one carb I missed; Asian noodle dishes. like pad thai. I got the angel-hair sized noodles. and they look like rice noodles. and come packaged in a liquid filled bag. I was surprised by the weight of the shipping box. They are made from plant fiber so no calories. carbs. sugar. wheat. etc. Crazy impossible. right?<br />I used these in a chicken dish with a spicy sauce. and they were really enjoyable. not funky. and cured my Asian noodle craving. The consistency is very similar to al dente rice noodles in pad thai.<br />So if you are watching carbs. calorie. sugar. gluten. etc. and are looking for a pasta alternative. check them out.
36492,B004CLCEDE,ASFHWIUU91HMD,Ellen,0/0,1350345600,Positive Review,To be perfectly honest. I was scared to death to give these noodles a try.  With all the negative comments. I was sure I'd wasted my money.  First of all. everyone talked about the fishy stinky smell when opening the package.  I didn't smell a thing.  I neither avoided or stuck my nose in the package.  I simply opened the pack. dumped in a strainer and rinsed.  No big deal!<br /><br />I got my water boiling and put them in the water long enough to heat.  I drained and added a little olive oil to keep them from sticking together.  I put marinara sauce on them and added my meatballs.  I then topped it off with grated parmesan cheese.  I'm looking forward to stir fry next.  I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about; I'm one of the pickiest people I know when it comes to how my food taste!<br /><br />These noodles are thin. white/clear in color.  I tasted one plain; it doesn't have a negative taste but bland and will absorb the flavors of what you're cooking with.  I have no idea why people say they look like worms!  They are the typical Asian noodle you would find in Asian/Oriental cooking.<br /><br />If you have missed having high carb noodles you should give these a try.  If you are a die-hard wheat spagetti person. then maybe these won't satisfy your craving for spagetti and meatballs.  I'm going to rate them a 5 because I know they will be even better in the oriental dishes I've been missing.
36497,B004CLCEDE,A3BAAGY2HS6LU1,~Jen~,0/0,1348617600,Smells bad,These are great filler noodles. They do however smell pretty bad when you open the bag. This however does't transfer to the taste. They just take on the flavor of whatever you add them to.
36512,B004CLCEDE,A3NLR7Z8PM8EV3,rb315,0/0,1334016000,great noodles,I'm a diabetic. so I love having a noodle like product I can eat that won't mess with my blood sugar.  I eat them almost every day- they're very filling and have helped me lower the carb copntent of my diet radically.  As other commenters have said before me. the smell does dissipate a lot after rinsing- rinse them well.  I have started using a salad spinner to dry them- works great.
36517,B004CLCEDE,A2K355EK826QRJ,Sunshine,0/0,1330473600,Overpriced,I feel like you don't get enough noodles for the money.  It is incredibly expensive. there aren't that many noodles. and I did NOT feel full from this.  The noodles do smell once you take them out of the package; however. they cook up rather easily.  They will stick together - so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels. make sure that you lay them out - otherwise. you will have issues later.  They do NOT have a taste. so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with. otherwise. you will be disappointed.  Sorry. but I won't buy them again - too much money.
36521,B004CLCEDE,A1KJ5BQQWZIJJT,Eddie B,0/0,1330214400,Interesting Noodle Replacement,Bought these as a no carb alternative to noodles.  They are a great replacement when you are really craving noodles.  I have used for spaghetti and other red sauce dishes.<br /><br />They smell a bit weird. and take some getting used to.  They have the texture of noodles. but don't taste like anything.  Would not recommend eating them by themselves.  Great with your favorite spaghetti sauce.
36522,B004CLCEDE,ALBRJ3EUDKQ3C,linda m. eclectic,0/0,1330128000,a good filler,don't kid yourself...these don't taste like pasta. However. they go extremely well with a vegetable stir-fry (throw them right in there after thoroughly. and i do mean thoroughly. rinsing them). They are practically negative calories and apparently good for you.

36579,B004CLCEDE,AUOYSN9TQVO2H,Blind Lemon Pledge,2/4,1308009600,the GAG ME diet,Do not buy these!!!!<br />And if you think you can ignore all the negative reviews. just because you so sorely wanted a pasta substitute. you'll be extremely disappointed. What's amazing is that even many of the 4 and 5 star reviewers admit to the things tasting horrible. But still. because they're labeled as 'noodles'. some people will maintain a willingness to force them down.....such is the lure  of Pasta!<br /> I suppose you could freeze fecal matter and sell it as ice cream and  some people would choose  to eat it if they desperately craved ice cream and wanted to believe the packaging.<br /><br />These are shaped like noodles.<br />All resemblance to any type of real noodle ends there.<br /><br />Horrible smell....as noted here.gags many people.Smells like a fish that rotted in a beaker of benzene<br />Horrible texture....like a scary foreign body in your food.<br />No flavor (beyond the obnoxious smell) They don't really absorb any flavor either. The sauce just coats the outside. and in eating. any  sauce  quickly departs the  noodle surface and you're left with this disgusting mass of  slimy rubber  worms in your mouth. Even well rinsed. the weird fishy smell remains in your olfactory memory throughout the meal. thereby  eliciting a constant. low order.  gag reflex as you try to chew these things.<br /><br />Somehow I pushed the order button twice...so I'll be throwing out $60 worth of 'food'.. Not sure I want them in my garbage can. I may have to drive them straight to the local land fill.<br />I didn't expect greatness from a zero calorie noodle. but I really hoped these things would  at least be a palatable substitute.....not even close.<br /><br />Proving again; there's no such thing as a free lunch.
36581,B004CLCEDE,AZJWKIA0X6SAU,Niksta,0/1,1332892800,If you don't like fishy foods. Do Not Buy these!!!!,I was skeptical when I saw reviews that said they tasted reminents of fishiness. but then I read further from reviewers that talked about strategies to get rid of that smell/taste.  I can tell you that I very thoroughly rinsed them in warm and cold water for 5-10 minutes. I then boiled them for another few minutes. rinsed. drained and blotted with a papertowel to take away<br />any and all water...and guess what the noodles were still extremely fishy and disgusting tasting!!  Save your money. Period.
36585,B004CLCEDE,A1II4BFTUJ4CD,cevans624,0/1,1328227200,Not worth it. tastes like rubber,I see how these are supposed to take the place of normal noodles. They come no where close. I followed the directions for cooking. they are awful. I find you would have to put so much sauce and flavorings to cover up the chemical taste that you probably arent saving that many calories.<br />I tried it with spaghetti sauce. once w/ chicken and alfredo. I even did ranch dressing on a few. still Nasty. They are tough to bite and just taste weird.<br />I will stick with whole wheat pasta or a blend from now on. I would rather work on portion sizes than eat these. Absolutely horrible.
36600,B004CLCEDE,A34UXYIMHKFSEQ,flirtbud,0/1,1319155200,miracle noodle shirataki pasta,Gross!!!!They come in water. Smell like spoiled fish. Taste is horrible. I tried putting something on them and still tasted bad. Don't waste money like I did. I ended up throwing them out.
36601,B004CLCEDE,A3GUX9OSWFJHOO,Michael R Burke,0/1,1314748800,Fishy and satisfying,So I bought these for my wife because she is into fitness and had heard about these noodles from people she works out with. Apparently they are zero calorie fillers and make it easier when cutting to lower your carb intake. When she opened the bag. there was a definite hint of fishiness. I was skeptical that they would be good. but she cooked them up and added a decent sauce and I couldn't really taste anything awry. I can't really say they are good or bad tasting. because they pretty much take on the flavor of whatever you eat them with. They were pretty satisfying and made me feel full for quite a while. I guess they are just fiber. Overall. I find them to be a bit expensive as a means of taking in zero calories. If I want to do that in the future I will just eat less. If I were a weaker person. however. that needs to feel full all the time. these might be a great solution.
36605,B004CLCEDE,A36YULD2D2DS86,rachel g rachel,0/1,1306454400,YUCKKKKK!!! wormy texture,I wish i read all the 1 star reviews before wasting my money.. i have never tasted something so horrible..i love most  health food so didn't expect to find it this bad..between the fishy smell. the consistency. the texture..everything about it..
36610,B004CLCEDE,AMCY0N4SZJAM,gritsgrl,1/3,1324598400,The nastiest stuff I have ever put in my mouth!,I was excited to see these noodles thru an advertisement.  I ordered six packets.  They were the nastiest. foulest smelling thing I have ever come across! I washed them off several times; stink was still there!<br />My dog wouldn't even eat them. and. he eats everything!  Don't waste your money!
36619,B004CLCEDE,A2FVVKEJYV07YA,Danielle Harms,0/2,1326326400,Miracle Noodles - its a miracle you can even get past the smell!!!,There was no miracle about these noodles! They are in fact the worst thing I have ever attempted to eat in my life. They were so horrible I don't even care about returning them! For some laughs I gave them to friends to gag over just as I did!
36625,B004CLCEDE,A16PF88I8Y6EX5,Keegan,0/3,1321228800,Good Fish Bait,I was thinking about the great number people that dislike these noodles and wondering what they would do with the extra packs they have order. I think I may have the solution Fish Bait!!! It smells bad which fish like and it is rubber-like which will stay on the hook well.  Just a thought
36628,B004CLCEDE,A2J750Z7NAR4IG,Michael C. Beasley,2/8,1305331200,Description is  a LIE!,The total net carbs is NOT Zero. According the label on the package Total carb is less than 1g. that could be .999999. It is NOT Zero. Amazon would not take a return on this item. but they did refund me the complete order price.<br /><br />If you want a true zero carb product. this is not it.<br /><br />Also there is zero fiber listed . so nothing to offset the carbs.<br />Strange since the description says it is made only from the soluble fiber of the plant.
36635,B004CLCEDE,AT452CR3ER9VT,Jennifer,7/7,1306368000,0 calories-awesome!,I was prepared for an awful smell when opening the bag based on the reviews. The water smells like fish. not a big deal to me. I rinsed the noodles for 2 minutes in hot water. then placed in boiling water for another 2-3 minutes. I then mixed the noodles with the sauce only from a popular Spicy Szechuan Style Vegetable & Chicken weight loss frozen food (softened it in the microwave. then cut the sauce from the noodles packaged with it). I put the noodles with the sauce in the fridge for 22 hours before eating them based on the suggestion of other reviews.<br /><br />The texture is.....strange. There is no food product on the market that I can 100% compare it to. They are rubbery and somewhat hard to break down with your teeth when you chew them.<br /><br />Marinating the noodles did not help. they were still flavorless. but it didn't matter very much because the sauce itself was spicy enough to mask the fact that the noodles had no flavor.<br /><br />I'd suggest the noodles to anyone trying to lose weight or cut down on carbs. They are not something I would want to eat otherwise.
36640,B004CLCEDE,AG29M01790NAC,michelle,8/9,1309132800,Miracle Noodle Pasta,Quick shipping.<br /><br />I really didn't like these noodles. The texture was awful & they had absolutely no taste at all. I threw the other 5 packs of them in the garbage. They actually turned my stomach. I had really hoped that they would be a great & healthy replacement for real noodles - boy was I wrong!
36646,B004CLCEDE,AMAJTQQFPJ1U0,Ange,4/4,1344124800,Love my crazy noodles!,I'm a gluten intolerant cook with a family of carb addicts; normally. I cook up a spaghetti squash for myself while they enjoy their whole wheat pasta. However. spaghetti squash takes up to an hour to cook. and I don't always have it on hand. I read about these noodles and decided to give it a shot. After all. you can cancel subscribe & save at any time. right?<br /><br />No way am I canceling S&S on this product; in fact. I upped my S&S schedule so I could make sure I always have some on hand. I don't use them for pasta dishes alone anymore - they're a staple in my Thai chicken soup. dry-roasted with chicken. sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese; dry-roasted with garlic and parmesan for a quick lunch. etc.<br /><br />I have two ways of cooking it. depending on the meal: rinse thoroughly in colander. then cook for 1 minute in microwave with about 1/4 c. (homemade) chicken stock (good for spaghetti type meals) or dry-roasting (basically. rinse thoroughly and drain; heat a small skillet on med-high. then add drained noodles and cook. flipping noodles around. for about 3 minutes.
36655,B004CLCEDE,AJ70YO0SQOMBI,Gia's mom Lau,4/4,1305763200,Not a big fan,My husband and I are on Atkins and decided to try these noodles.  I'd rather make pasta out of zucchini or some other veggie.  I prepped it as per the instructions.  I rinsed it longer than necessary. boiled it for a minute and then decided to pan fry it for good measure.  I made an alfredo sauce for it and tossed some in while in the pan since it's supposed to absorb flavors.  My husband took one bite and said no way.  He couldn't get past the texture.  I mixed it with the sauce and some grilled chicken. but had to stop eating it.  It made me gag after a while.  I tried so hard to like it. but just couldn't.  I'll wait a few weeks 'till I can have the low carb pasta.  This is totally not worth it.  Sadly. I ordered it from the Miracle Noodle site so I have several bags left.  I may try again. but most likely they will end up in the trash.
36662,B004CLCEDE,A2DTKAXGL6P97U,Classical Arminian,3/3,1318032000,Thank you!,There was a person who reviewed this product that said those who rated it 5 stars are exaggerating. and those who rated it 1 star are doing the same.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The noodles does smell fishy right out of the package. but rinse it under hot water for a minute and the smell will go away.  As far as the texture is concerned. it is exactly like the Filipino noodles that are made of mung beans called sotanghon.  It is NOT like eating cartilage.  It absorbs the flavor of whatever you are adding to it which makes them versatile.  The possibilities wiht what you can make out of them is endless.  The best thing about it is that it has zero calories. zero fat. zero sugar. and zero carbs.  Whoever invented this should get an award.
36667,B004CLCEDE,AJ83DFYV61YR5,George,3/3,1306281600,my new diet staple,From the other reviews. I expected these to stink up my kitchen. They didn't. there is just a bit of a fishy smell like you'd get if you opened a bag of frozen seafood. No big deal. They aren't like pasta noodles. they have the same kind of feel in my mouth as the seaweed salad I order at sushi restaurants. To prepare these. I dried them really well with paper towels (they come in a bag of water). then sprayed a pan with Pam and basically stir fried them with cilantro and soy sauce. For no calories. utterly fantastic!
36687,B004CLCEDE,A22R357CWM097,Zombieparamour,2/2,1331164800,It's all in how you prepare them!,I really don't understand all the negative reviews. These noodles aren't made with eggs/flour/any of the normal components of pasta.of course they aren't going to taste like your average spaghetti dish and dousing them in ragu isn't going to make them as such. Great alternative to pasta if you're on a low-everything diet.
36691,B004CLCEDE,AGOSQ38IN6N00,nero2394,2/2,1326153600,Better than I thought,I received these today and can say anyone whining about the smell is a baby the smell isn't that bad even before washing them. They have absolutely NO TASTE which is great because they can go with anything. I tried them plain and no taste at all then I reheated some chili I made for dinner last night and it came out great mixed in. I would recommend that you start out with a smaller or thinner product when first trying them. Just realized I did order the Angel hair but received fettuccini but will be keeping them anyway since I already ate some. They do have a weird texture but with anything new it will take some getting used to & it's not so weird you can't eat it. I saw others claiming it was like jello but it's more like a noodle not cooked completely.
36693,B004CLCEDE,A19F0H720RYZ9H,Windstorm,2/2,1321574400,This will help you if you are serious about losing weight,I ordered Miracle Noodles off of their web site rather than Amazon. I got the variety pack and tried the Angel hair today and the fettucine yesterday.<br /><br />Don't go into this expecting it to taste like Pasta. Think of it as a substitute for pasta. You have to get used to a lot of things when you switch to a healthier lifestyle. Skim milk instead of 2% for example. when you first try it. it tastes like white water. but later on as you adjust to it. you can taste it as milk. Sweet and Low doesn't taste exactly like sugar either. but it gets the job done in a cup of coffee or tea. Like those. Miracle Noodles is not going to be exactly pasta. any more than say. spaghetti squash is pasta.<br /><br />It doesn't taste bad. it doesn't taste like anything at all. Part of the pleasure of pasta is in tasting the noodles themselves. but this isn't going to be the case for you with Miracle Noodles. You will only taste the flavors of whatever you put on the noodles or whatever you put the noodles into.<br /><br />The texture is rubbery (not as bad as that 'instant jellyfish' I tried from the Asian market. but still rubbery). This is tolerable and I do think I can get used to this. Apparently there are some recipes or techniques for making them less rubbery. I haven't tried those yet. The noodles in my two times eating them have tended to stick together so I have to eat them in clumps. I think this may not be the case if I had them in soup though. but I'll be trying that soon.<br /><br />One thing that was immediately apparent after I ate them was that I had a full. satisfied feeling. It made me feel content and as if I had been well fed even though the only substantial calories had come from the sauce I had put on them. I don't really believe they're calorie free completely. so I log them as 3 calories in my diet log. Still. for the way they fill me up for so few calories. they really feel worth it.<br /><br />So if you want something that is a decent substitute for pasta. which may be something of an acquired taste. then this is for you. If you really care about losing weight you will try whatever interesting foods you need to try in order to do it. This is a way to fill up with very few calories.<br /><br />Even if you don't like it. I think using it once a day is a good option to help people lose weight. Even if you don't like it. just eat it anyway and you'll be full and not hungry anymore. That alone is worth the price. If you do like them. then that's a bonus.
36719,B000ITWWZ4,A5X6PJANY4XW4,Tcat Houser A Customer,0/0,1348876800,Better than the mass market stuff!,I have enjoyed the mainstream pouches for a while. No heavy cans. and tasted better than canned.<br /><br />The same sort of jump from the Chicken of the Sea type to this offering.<br /><br />No longer 'sprucing it up' for a great snack or lunch.<br /><br />I just plop it on a plate and microwave for 60-90 seconds on low (about 20% power).<br /><br />Quite yummy and won't go back to the mass market stuff.
36729,B001HTJ2BQ,AXOSFCM74ZRV8,MaryPei,0/0,1303862400,Coconut Milk Regular User,We like to keep a stock of coconut milk in our pantry to make curries and such. This one has worked very well for us and am happy that it's back on Prime shipping!
36739,B001HTJ2BQ,A2VPQJEPBD5KZ6,H. Ziesing,2/5,1294272000,five year off exp date... skip it!!!,The cans are from Thailand. The exp date on the bottom of all the cans received reads 07. The contents of the only can I opened are solid. like a rock... There is very little moisture left in the can. It looks like a relabeled can. Amazon refunded my purchase price - I love Amazon :) peace
36741,B001HTJ2BQ,A1R91D7Q9J762F,Jo Ann Warner reading advocate,1/4,1328745600,Problems with congealed product,I have cancelled my ongoing delivery of this coconut milk because all the cans in the last two shipments have had congealed coconut at the top with a little liquid remaining underneath.  The coconut milk can be re-emulsified but still clumps and has to be opened with a can opener.  I used to just puncture the lid and pour it. The flavor is fine and I really like the product when it is in its correct condition.
36774,B001HTJ2BQ,A358LYMJRR1IJW,AngryMonkey serg3480fg34f7g1231,3/3,1312329600,Used to be great. Not sure anymore,Same experience as others here<br /><br />Been buying this stuff forever and had an active subscription as well.<br />Last shipment said product of Sri lanka and it's just awful compared to the original version from Thailand<br />The only thing that remained the same was the company name<br />Need to find another brand now<br />Very unhappy about this
36777,B001HTJ2BQ,AJ9R1EK560RDJ,P,2/2,1344816000,Perfect.,I have used 10/12 cans and I love this coconut milk!  I haven't received any dented cans and they have all had the best consistency and taste compared to any other coconut milk I have had.  It makes amazing ice cream and goes well whipped and in my tea. on top of my almond meal pancakes. with berries or other fruits. etc.  This stuff is great!  The only thing I find odd is that it hasn't hardened in the refrigerator.  But I still love it.
36790,B001HTJ2BQ,A3L28U28W3R7YV,Brandon High freaksdotcom,2/2,1310947200,Watery and thin,I purchased two cases of Native Forest Coconut milk and received the Sir Lanka-sourced product.<br /><br />It is thin. with hardly any fat. It's not suitable for cooking with. since it is too watery and does not have the richness of other brands of coconut milk. Thai Kitchen's coconut milk is much thicker and flavorful.<br /><br />The only upside is that I can use it undiluted in a shake. where I normally use 1:2 coconut milk and water. That's how thin it is. straight out of the can.
36792,B001HTJ2BQ,A3OIJYUJZTTOAK,Steph,2/2,1305072000,Thin. lower fat content,The Good:  Organic. BPA free. nice coconut flavor<br />The Bad:  Very runny. lower fat content than other coconut milk<br /><br />If you want organic and BPA free. this may be the only option.  If you are willing to give up one or the other. there are better options.
36794,B001HTJ2BQ,A28DN80EGD0LXX,Cat,1/1,1347494400,Two cans were not dented !,I don't care about dented cans. it should not affect the great quality of the product. (I buy this brand of coconut milk exclusively) I would not typically care about a dent here or there but of the case ONLY TWO were NOT dented. These cans look worse than any can you see on the ding bins at the grocery mart. The price is great but they should just list it as dented. clearly they get rid of the dented stock through amazon sales.
36865,B003ZTA43Q,A2NQ1MNUYUTRAP,Jiri Sladek,1/1,1300579200,Love it,I love this coffee. but what is with these prices? My local walmart sells it for $3.00 and some time on sale for $2.50 and here its like $4.15 each? why is that? and why would any one buy it from here?
36869,B001SAZ3FI,A27BOBA2PQ0D7J,B. Friedrich,2/2,1293580800,excellent,Product arrived as promised-in perfect condition and just as I remember them. Very prompt delivery. I will be ordering again and recommending them to friends. Thanks
36871,B0015TZAY6,A2ZP24D9L7SHY8,C. Horchner,2/2,1299628800,very good but lots of sugar and syrup,THESE ARE REALLY GOOD TASTING! So what does that mean is that they are not very healthy - not to many things taste this good and good for you.  I use them as a treat. Lots of sugar and syrup. They do have fiber but if your looking for a healthy snack - not a good choice but if your looking for a sweet yummy snack with some fiber this is it!
36875,B0015TZAY6,A2NDGYULBH21BI,LacieCakes,0/0,1316390400,good snack!,these are good to have around for a semi healthy snack. i prefer the golden apple chips. but these are good too.
36877,B0015TZAY6,A15V4TJBVYLK94,Reanbug,0/0,1291248000,Excellent Chips,Great flavor! I love that these apple chips come flavored. so many out there are bland and boring.  A chip should be salted or sugared or something and these are great!
36883,B0015TZAY6,A2XNJJ9TF70P4J,Angie,0/4,1258761600,I don't like them,I've tried all the flavors. and I don't care for them. They are crispy which is weird for an apple. and they taste like they were soaked in oil. The flavored ones are way too sweet and even the plain ones have corn syrup. which is really bad for you. They also have a lot of fat and sugar. which is completely stupid since this snack claims to be healthy. I feel bad eating these because they are not healthy at all. I'd rather eat a real apple or some dried fruit.
36886,B004AIBSFE,A1CRI20AK5MQAS,FOODIE,2/2,1321401600,Frantoia Extra Virgin Olive Oil,This olive oil is terrific.  I love to dip garlic bread in it and use in sauces.  The slight fruity taste is fabulous.  I've seen the pros on TV use this many times.  SuperOlive shipped it super fast.
36893,B004AIBSFE,A3KY4ID0JOLWES,M,0/0,1349395200,Great flavor.,Was in Napa Valley at the Dean & Deluca store.  Talking with a couple of chefs I observed what oil they were purchasing.  Frantoia  was their choice.  I sent bottles around the country for holiday gifts and everyone loved it.  Going to do the same this year.
36898,B000H7CURW,A21LQBK94KH4EE,Dr-Cog,0/0,1330128000,Nice Heat,I like popcorn. I like hot things... This stuff has just the right heat and is pretty addicting. I always eat the whole bag in one sitting. If you like a burning tongue. a runny nose. and cayenne pepper like fumes in the air. get this stuff!
36916,B001GVIS6K,A1U3NQOYVZXKU7,VenJal,1/1,1322438400,Wonderful Organic Taste,I like to drink barley soup everyday. It makes me feel good. This is one of the best Barley power I ever had. I mix three table spoons of Barley in to cold water. stir it well and then dump in to boiling water. get it cooled a bit and drink it with pinch of salt. This Arrowhead barley taste so great. every time I feel. I get connected to Nature after drinking it. Great organic product and I give full stars to it.
36923,B001GVIS6K,A3O3Q9NBH3RV2F,K,0/0,1327536000,good for baking and as a baby cereal,I use this mostly as a baby cereal (cook like cream of wheat but with lots of stirring). It also works fine in baked goods.
36924,B001GVIS6K,A2M9Z11S0S9DBD,Suzan Touchette,0/0,1327017600,BBBBBBarley......,I find this to be about the same as Bobs Red Mill Barley. except in organic.  I wish. however. that it came in units of 4 insterad of 6.  Five bags of this fills up the 5.3 qt containers I purchased and there's still a bag to do something with....  Good quality though.  My sourdough starter ate it right up  :)
36944,B001EQ4RWQ,A1STKKH266D2XU,M. Schuster,5/7,1181260800,GREAT Sugar-Free Chocolate Syrup by Hershey !!!,For us diabetics. this sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup is just the ticket!  It tastes FABULOUS -- so good that no one would guess it was sugar-free unless you told.  Pour it over your favorite sugar-free ice cream (mine is mint chocolate chip). and you can enjoy a treat fit for a king or queen (diabetic or not) without having to watch your blood sugar go crazy.  Thank you. Hershey's. for making such a WONDERFUL product !!!
36974,B001GVIS6U,A3ENT44HBOUICX,C. B. Nguyen,2/2,1323820800,The best way to get your fiber!,Creamy. with very very minimal grainy texture that tastes plain with tasteful if done right. What I do is cook this over a stove in a saucepot like in the instructions and when I serve it in a bowl I like to add 2 full bananas and mash and slice it in my bowl of this hot cereal and then I top it with a few pecans and its ready for my hungering appetite! It tastes soooo good with the sweetness and added texture of the banana and the crunch from the pecans. It taste nothing nasty that one often think of when its full of fiber. You can also prepare this in the microwave but beware the microwave instruction time. I did it on 8 minutes and it came out dried to the bowl. I would check every few minutes for consistency!
37051,B000ARTNRE,A19JJ6Y8UQVEST,somedude,0/2,1304812800,Corn syrup solids and sugar as ingredients,If that is your cup of tea. go for it. For us we had better results with Good Start and Earths Best.
37053,B000ARTNRE,A1NGGJB51ASX6V,smr smr,2/6,1295049600,They suck you in with a low price,I signed up for this item under subscribe and save. and it was offered at a very reasonalbe price.  I first experienced delays with the product that were very annoying.  Then after I received a few shipments the price went up considerably. for the quantity I get. it rose over $20.00.  I have done other subscribe and save items. and have experienced the same problem.  It's very disappointing that Amazon can justify a price increase like this all at one time.
37054,B000ARTNRE,ABJ1JI51HW8F7,Julia,1/9,1321833600,Disappointed,The first ingredient is corn syrup solids; 2nd is sucrose. I have no idea why there needs to be corn syrup in baby formula.
37056,B000ARTNRE,A1CXOHPI70SK4M,sam,0/11,1298764800,very bab product,My son was on that formula.he had bab colic he would throw up from his moutth and nose i had to change to good start soy which he tolerates well. this milk is not good for newborn
37060,B000BYPF7S,A1T9B9G6ZZRXL0,PattiPLB,1/1,1347148800,Welcome Back!,Petsmart stop carrying these bones.  Thought I was sunk.  Now my 3 dogs will entertain<br />themselves for hours and I can get some peace.  Not quiet. but I won't complain.  The<br />bones will last for months.  Hot Damn!!!
37090,B002P99DOI,A3AQPO5WO0ANY1,george,0/0,1337472000,Loving It,Had a cup of this tea and it was like reliving the past. Always drank this blend at a small Chinese Resturant in Queens. NY. After my first sip I felt like I was back thier enjoying a big pot of tea. Smooth and Relaxing. great blend and will be ordering more soon.
37112,B002IVDAH4,A1DMF3MR624OBE,ayeayeee,0/0,1350691200,LID Green Pea and Chicken.,I purchased this after success with the green pea and duck formula.  I had hoped that our cats would take to it as well as they had the duck formula. but one has started to lose fur since switching.  I suspect that she may be allergic or sensitive to chicken. so we'll be switching back to the duck and may try the salmon to add a little variety.
37115,B002IVDAH4,A2Q7P7AAA4I7KD,D. M. Baringer,0/0,1326844800,Cats like it,I switched my dog to grain free food. and since the cats and him eat each others food I had to put the cats on grain free also.  This food was a big hit!  Now the dog eats this food and ignores his own food.  Natural Balance is much less expensive than most of the grain free brands
37120,B002IVDAH4,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,B. Davis The Happy Hermit,5/10,1317168000,Big mistake,My cat. who has been on a gluten-free all-canned diet for a few years. did not like this food.  I got her to eat maybe two tablespoons over the course of two days and that was all it took to wreak havoc with her system.  I bought the food based on my complete satisfaction with the same brand of canned food and also because I would like to be able to feed dry food in addition to canned.  I thought my cat would appreciate some variety as would I.  So here I am wide awake at 3 am laundering sheets because immediately after a near liquid litter box episode she bee-lined it for my bed.  Obviously this food is a huge success in some households and I wish more than anyone that my experience was positive too.  But considering my lost night's sleep. the total waste of money. and the negative impact on my cat's health. what other rating can I give this product?  I rate based on my own experience and this purchase was disastrous for me and my cat so I give one star.
37132,B000P8HPCI,A3E9EN6GPY4VFC,Ron Smith R Smith,2/2,1322956800,Hmmm good,What you see is what you get and there isn't anything better tasting.  We have enjoyed it at parties. during family get-togethers and in general.  Would buy again.
37135,B000P8HPCI,A3I9PGVKL3PE8,L. Clements,2/2,1279065600,Best Olives Ever!!!,These olives are the best quality olives (they resemble a black olive in taste - a really good black olive).  Not to salty like greek or green olives.  Pleasent flavor and compliments cheese and crackers or even a deli tray.  My friends loved these (big hit).
37136,B000P8HPCI,A2VL1NE3FA7YEW,W.M,1/1,1342742400,Good Quality canned olives but not that agreeable about the price,- The appearance of the Olives are high in quality and you can tell that<br />  Grabers was very selective in the olives that were being canned.<br />- The Olives are unpitted.<br />- The taste is a lot like the black olives that you would find in a grocery store<br />  with somewhat of a more buttery taste.<br />- The texture of the olives is not as firm as the canned black olives but softer<br />  (in a good way) but not mushy.<br /><br /> Having said this. I think they are a bit overpriced (especially if you are paying for shipping) and I wouldn't buy a second can for $12.99... but that's just me. Some personally may really like them enough to get them because they are not common in Grocery Stores but I buy a lot of olives and have tried many varieties from brined to oil cured and from different countries and honestly. to me. these taste just like the common canned black olives.
37147,B002ATEZOG,A2UAP79S67P085,Amie,2/3,1329782400,Do You Love Almonds. but Hate Chewing?,Then almond butter is for you!  No longer will you have to spend time masticating almond after almond. hoping for just a few seconds of creamy goodness.  These little packages. after a little kneading and finagling. will deliver strips of almond butter to any vehicle you'd like - celery!  crackers!  your finger!
37167,B000BGXAFA,A7LP72SYUQ9NT,W. WATTERS,0/0,1350086400,Tasty and healthy choice of soup!,Hi! I'm pleased to have purchased Kikkoman Instant Shiro Miso. This soup is very easy to prepare. Simply add hot water and stir. Outer envelope contains 3 individual serving packets. Salt content might be on the high side for some users. Best to check product details. The soup does not taste salty. I would buy this miso soup again.
37183,B003CK2BQG,A3SAFHH0PFJN02,Susan E. Gosland SueG907,2/3,1264896000,Great Tea,Stash has been making wonderful teas for many years. and this is one of their best.  It is a green tea. with raspberry and pomegranate bits for flavor.  It is also a healthy tea.  I put freh or frozen fruit in it sometimes. which makes it even better.  I love this tea!!
37195,B003CK2BQG,AQ2FC1DLKVD8H,P. McWhorter,0/0,1335484800,Unpleasant Grassy Taste,I realize that taste in tea. and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me. I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag. I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea. I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp bite I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week. and see if I am missing something. but as for now. I can not recommend purchasing this tea.
37209,B003CK2BQG,A3RKMHCAPC9LKX,M. Di Noto,0/0,1327363200,Mint?,This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of. but . .  where is the mint!?  Very. very mild mint flavor. With Moroccan Mint clearly plastered on the box. I really expected more flavor.
37216,B003CK2BQG,ADS5APY1NKTL4,D. Pawl Dani,0/0,1322265600,This green tea is for me....,I would. by no means. consider myself a green tea expert. but. I definitely appreciate its place in my life. and as part of my morning breakfast ritual. I find that I feel the antioxidants percolate in my head. What's more. I actually am one of those weird people who like how bitter it tastes. when you've brewed it to its full potential. Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint. in the antioxidant factor. What's more. there is a wonderful smoky quality. too. Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas. and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water......
37220,B003CK2BQG,A2I6FFCUE6KID9,Stone Maven Stone Maven,0/0,1320451200,The only green tea I like,I drink Twinings Orange Pekoe black tea. raspberry leaf tea and this. I can't stand any other teas very much.<br /><br />This is especially wonderful with a greek or middle eastern dinner.
37227,B003CK2BQG,A2J96FILPQA01,VS2929,0/0,1314921600,Great tea to drink!,I drink green tea because its healthy for you especially green tea. Ide say this tea with sugar tastes very very good its one of my drop the soda substitute since its so great! I recommend this tea to buy over some of the more nastier tea's out there but Great Product overall!
37244,B003CK2BQG,A2E5SFGXPPOR0X,A Reader,0/0,1283040000,My favorite iced tea!,I've never had an iced tea that I like better. and I LOVE iced tea.  I make it in an iced tea maker using a little less ice/water than the markings on the carafe. and I use 6 tea bags which produces just slightly less than 2 quarts.  When it is done brewing. pour it over ice and be sure to squeeze in a little lemon which rounds out the flavors - it makes it the perfect beverage.  The fact that it is healthy is just a bonus!!  (If you don't have an iced tea maker. it's a really worthwhile. inexpensive investment if you drink a lot of tea)
37251,B003CK2BQG,A2WFF0N19CJX5,Paula,0/0,1267228800,Good balanced Green Tea,This is a good green tea. It is balanced and doesn't have that often grassy taste that green teas tend to have. I would assume that is due to the fact that it is a mix with white tea also. Definitely better than most other green teas !
37266,B003CK2BQG,A38OCDJQOAQ2XG,P. McGuire,0/0,1207699200,Great Tea,I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way. it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it.
37267,B003CK2BQG,A2J8BAM4AX4FGA,A. Carsley,0/0,1206748800,The Best Green Tea,In my opinion. Stash makes the best Green Tea on the market.  I have tried others and they taste to grassy.  This has a great flavor and makes it easy to enjoy it the health benefits of drinking the tea. Enjoy!
37268,B003CK2BQG,ANNGQJC6V079T,KDH,0/0,1205107200,love it iced!,Such a great tea. glad to see it on Amazon since my local grocers don't carry it.  Totally agree with the other reviewers about how yummy it is.<br />I love it iced. but my FIL likes it hot when he visits.
37274,B003CK2BQG,A1E9I5NUTLM7XB,Melanie Tye Amazon.com Junkie,1/2,1163289600,Tastes like Cough Syrup,I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor. but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child. so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine. I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways. thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor. but I just couldn't do it! Well. that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me. let me know!
37275,B003CK2BQG,A1AEQZM99LO9VA,Debra Koch,0/1,1298851200,Astringent. weak tea,I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like. I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting. leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time. then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.
37280,B003CK2BQG,A119BG4E0YL6G7,H. Boykin,7/7,1168819200,Relaxing with Green Chai tea,Stash Green Chai Tea is delicious and very aromatic.  Wonderful  served plain. with honey.  It is even better with milk or half and half.
37286,B003CK2BQG,A38KRK4Z0AXC59,TODD TEMPLETON,0/1,1298332800,Green tea,I'm new to green tea so I purchased this product with Bigelow Green Tea. Preferred tea is Bigelow without any doubt but that's my personal preference.
37297,B003CK2BQG,A3U7LZDJ6ZF3AU,Poodle Mom,1/5,1288137600,Not if you like Salada Green Chai Tea,I'd never tried this before. but because I like Salada's version so much. and the reviews were so good. I figured I'd try it.  Well. it's just not MY cup of tea - really intesely sweet spices - back to Salada for me!
37304,B003CK2BQG,A21SY1XMVRH3YQ,AsiancCharm AC,4/4,1304640000,Stash fails splendidly this time.,The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea. are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life. this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea. you maybe be very disappointed like I do.
37314,B003CK2BQG,A4TAYDT1ZW49D,Jon Inazaki,3/3,1171411200,Very good for what it is,We've been product testing a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received. just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama Sushi Bar tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea taste and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. Sushi Bar-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described. it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However. it's idiot-proof and. like the title alludes to. this is teabag tea and for that. the Stash is very good stuff.
37325,B003CK2BQG,AY8K9KDD98MPU,mattflo,2/2,1232582400,the best I've found,I've tried several spicy chai teas and this is by far the best.  It is much better than Bigelow's green chai.  With a generous addition of honey and a bit of milk. this is wonderful stuff.
37342,B003CK2BQG,A281NPSIMI1C2R,Rebecca of Amazon The Rebecca Review,1/1,1329696000,Tea for a Rainy Afternoon,I'm trying to drink more green tea because it is so good for you. I'm trying all the Stash green teas one after the other. This one is a favorite as it had a strong Pomegranate and Raspberry flavor I love. By mixing these flavors in with green tea it makes green tea less bitter. The ingredients in this tea include: green tea. chamomile. hibiscus. orange peel. pomegranate flavor. raspberry flavor and Japanese matcha. A perfect tea with honey on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
37374,B003CK2BQG,A3OBSSAP9PT4C3,Mommy of 6 kids Mom of 6,1/1,1235520000,Wonderful Teas,I bought this tea wanting to try something new and was NOT dissapointed.<br />I drink it every morning.
37376,B003CK2BQG,A16J5JVUTKVJV3,T. Eng daddy,1/1,1235001600,nice subtle flavor,I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left. nearly out of stock. does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like. the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.
37386,B000LQNC30,A2RHHT6S4E3V53,Thomas Striedinger,0/0,1186012800,Nussini in US,I used to buy as many Nussinis as I could fit into my suitcase every time I went to Austria. and would have people visiting us here bring it as well. This may be the second best chocolate in the world (Pischinger Mandeltorte being the best). Kudos to Amazon for having such a wide Milka selection!
37389,B003D39UTI,AR3KQROBOC2K0,Klaatu,0/0,1345939200,Tasty decaf...!!!,This is a wonderful blend of decaf. very chocolaty. I think.  I don't like to drink caffeine all day long. so in-between will have this wonderful decaf. and I will also often do a half-caf using Tiny Footrpint light roast blend along with their decaf blend.  Makes a great half-caf...  :)  The price is also good for organic coffee beans for the poundage.
37415,B000FBO9LK,A1OLSDX3B8CN10,Cara K. Smith Georgia Garderer,2/2,1170720000,Tea Biscuits,Love these tea biscuits. The price was great for a box of 12. I hope you continue to carry.
37418,B000FBO9LK,A1RC8J259UP7S9,A. Sorkin,1/1,1291593600,Arrived melted/stuck together,The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.  Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below.  It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here.  It was 65F here when the package was delivered.
37435,B000FBO9LK,A3I3CDH63BQQZO,V. Tonry,0/0,1276041600,Great cookies--don't buy in the summer,These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However. when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive. but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.
37446,B000FBO9LK,A1SU1ANQEEI0UN,Phillip Phillip,0/0,1234051200,Love these cookies!,These cookies are just wonderful!!! The chocolate is deep. dark. rich and melts very nicely in your mouth.  I would say that it is a bittersweet chocolate and very finely made. These cookies give the chocolate lover a satisfying chocolate experience. Do not hesitate to buy them!
37450,B000FBO9LK,A36EWD31PZBF6P,Roseanne Klahm,0/0,1198108800,Light. flaky & delicious,I first had these cookies at our Oktoberfest where they were giving out samples.  I loved them and could not find them at World Market so I went to the internet and found them available at Amazon. They are very light and flaky.
37455,B000FBO9LK,A1PB97BLMR9X2S,L. Jenkins Laurie-J,1/2,1213747200,Light. Flaky & Tasty GOOD Cookie!!,I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin. flaky. crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!
37467,B00473DWEW,A7QJPHFBB6EVC,Gregory Ernst,0/0,1344211200,This stuff is so good.,Stadium Mustard is to mustard what bacon is to cured meats.  It turns your food into a mustard delivery device.  It's not overbearing. or overly spicy...just the right combination of flavors to enhance your meal.  It's impossible to get at local stores. so I bought a case.  I gave a few to family members & friends. and they keep asking for more.  Highly recommended.
37469,B00473DWEW,A1TFYYLUM64JR0,jerry D,0/2,1345939200,forgetaboutit,This mustard isn't worth what people say. If you like an exceptionaly creamy and NO taste mustard this ones for you people with no taste. Waste of money. GO find Koops Deli mustard for the best taste.

Fowler Dragonfly77,0/0,1348099200,My dog is happy. healthy. and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs!,I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care. but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare. but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that. once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients. there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance. especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health. she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl. she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand. but since she's getting older.  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky. but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog. I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words. a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy. healthy. and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal. Ground Brown Rice. Ground Yellow Corn. Oatmeal.

37506,B003XRKW6O,AANFOAXUVIQ9U,Happy Dog,0/0,1343174400,Great Food,My two senior dogs absolutely love this food.  They were in good condition before. but are now in excellent condition.  My 15 year old mini poodle had a gas problem. but that was all.  His blood work showed an elevated liver count.<br /><br />My 9 year old standard poodle had soft stool. was lethargic and was generally just off.  The vet could find nothing wrong.  She recommended a food change to a senior food.<br /><br />We have completed our first full 30 lb bag and what a difference.  No more gas in Gizmo and the Standard Poodle. Clio. is acting very active and young again.  Her stool is also firm again.<br /><br />I am now going to be a regular customer as my vet likes the results also.
37534,B005BPVE90,A1RZ0J2CZZJOTX,Lori Everson,0/0,1334793600,bar,This is a very strong tasting bar.  It is not very sweet tasting. It is close to imposible to eat this with out a large drink. Does not seem to be very satisfying as an afternoon snack.
37544,B005BPVE90,A8WXLST0944GZ,J.

Think. Smile. are really soft and fresh. without the hardness of other bars.<br /><br />These are very soft. and have a really hearty flavor. (not like the lighter rice cake taste of other bars. but not as heavy and sticky as Cliff bars)<br /><br />I could eat these every day.
37546,B005BPVE90,A39KS438IBRU6E,Liberty4all DMZ,0/0,1330128000,25% of Your Daily Fiber in a Healthy Snack,Containing about 25% of the recommended daily intake of fiber. these bars are a fairly tasty way of obtaining it. However. don't expect an oatmeal raisin cookie type snack or a Larabar type snack either. It's dryer (meaning less fat/oil) than many snacks. It's also baked so it doesn't come across as a raw product either. The taste is pleasant and a bit more complex especially with the cocoa powder than many snacks. Finally. it's not an addictive snack which is good in that you won't be tempted to finish a box of these in three days. More health food than candy.
37562,B001FA1LVG,A17TDUBB4Z1PEC,jaded_green,1/1,1328572800,Kashi TLC Bars Strawberry 6-pack,I love these cereal bars!  They are similar to Nutri-Grain but better.  These do not contain high-fructose corn syrup.  I paid $15.20 for the 6-pack with Subscribe & Save discount.  That's $2.53 per box which is cheaper than I can buy them on sale at the local grocery store.  Excellent value.
37579,B001FA1LVG,AHM8CGKRVJ16,Duke W. Carter,0/0,1252195200,Better tasting. better for you,I love all of the Kashi bars. from the granola nut type to these more breakfast type.  The flavors are really good and I really enjoy having choices that are different from the run of the mill chocolate. peanut butter. strawberry. blueberry that are so common in all of the other bars.  The pumpkin is one of my favorite and I love how the strawberry tastes more like the real thing than what seems more like a mere flavor in the other brands.
37580,B001FA1LVG,A1BVV0DTYTHSAH,AsyahA,0/1,1335657600,YUCK!!!,I love most of the Kashi products I've tried. This was low in sugar which is great right BUT when my kids tried it and refused to finish it I tried it and I now know why. It tastes horrible....it has a very weird funny taste to it.
37590,B005VBBSYK,A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,Angela Evans,11/12,1331078400,can form part of a breakfast; cheaper elsewhere,These breakfast biscuits/cookies come in three flavors - oat. blueberry. and apple cinnamon.  Each wrapped container contains four biscuits/cookies that are generously sized and oval shaped.  The golden oat flavor reminded me of a graham cracker that had been paired with oats.  The flavor was pleasant with a slightly sweet component.  I think the product is best when paired with tea and a piece of fruit.<br /><br />I did not experience increased energy and when eaten alone the product did not keep me full very long.  When paired with a banana or apple and some almonds. I could see these cookies being used as part of a quick breakfast.<br /><br />The product has a good bit of fat and sugar.

I am always looking for something unusual to add to my eating routine. This arrived fast and I am loving this unique edible. I can eat them plain but I like to make a little sushi rice and roll it into a ball. then add the seaweed paper over it. I also like to cut it in my food processor adding in toasted sesame seeds. It makes a great topping to steamed jasmine rice. MUCH better than the pre-made-heat-up-in-the-microwave sushi rice/seaweed combos you find in the supermarket..
37642,B002R81L92,A27LCANTGRS9HD,Macan,1/1,1321228800,OH MY!!,The chocolate covered pomegranates are luscious.  Wonderful dark chocolate covering these chewy-center candies can't be too bad for you. what with dark chocolate and pomegranates both healthy foods!  They are a little smaller than an M&M Peanut candy. so they would not be appropriate for very young children. so Moms have an excuse to not share. At a party they are great mixed in a bowl with peanuts.  Everyone raves about them and wants to know where I buy them.

Average size is about like a peanut M&M candy.  Wonderful. can't think of a bad thing to say about them except that the bag always empties too soon.  Great to have on hand (if you can keep them that long) for when company comes over. I pick them up at Costco where the price is better. What a treat!

But somewhere along the way it got overheated and all melted together in a big ball. Ruined the chocolate and ended up throwing it away.

If you are a I need a little sweet person and want just a BIT of yummy to pop in your mouth these are totally satisfying because they have a bit of kick. But the true win in a household of athletes is adding them to trail-mix. If it is hot- They will melt and then glob together with all the other items. These are a delightful little add-in to really upgrade the quality of average trail-mix.<br />Also a nice treat for kids to just snack on something little.
37663,B002R81L92,A7GIQIOYDJMAP,Bee,0/0,1340150400,chocolate-sweet and pomegranate-tart!,I knew the candy HAD to be without pomegranate seeds. I love chocolate. and so I imagined the flavor would be 'nice.'<br /><br />BUT WAIT! MORE than nice. this candy is spectacular-tasting! The thick dark chocolate melts away to reveal the tangy and chewy pomegranate fruit (yep. no seeds!). Or. if you are a glutton. pop a few and chew away; you will be a happy glutton!

I had to hide the bag from myself...I snack on a few everyday and this bag is just about done.  These are soooo DELICIOUS and because both dark chocolate and pomegranate is good for you I believe this is a very good snack for a sweet tooth.  I'm truly addicted.
37708,B004PXEZAE,A2DPYV7W1GDTV0,ShopperGuy1234 ShopperGuy1234,5/5,1319241600,Good taste but not so great packaging......Buy with some reservation,I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns. whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences. I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn). even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.<br /><br />First impression: Packaging looks great and the illustration on the box lures you to try it at once as soon as you look at the box.<br /><br />Cooking: I used my Sharp microwave 1200 W. 1.2 cubic feet of sheer raw cooking power. Even though my microwave has sensor based cooking feature for popcorn and other food items. I set the microwave timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds. so as to not leave anything to chance. Instructions on the pack are very clear about up & down side markings. cooking time. handling instructions etc. After cooking for 2 & 1/2 minutes. I carefully removed the popcorn bowl (as it miraculously transforms itself into).<br />Now comes the little tricky part. Instruction on the bowl clearly indicates how to handle the bowl and how to remove the top plastic off the bowl. so as to dig in and help yourself with the buttery popcorn. So I tried opening the bowl by pulling the plastic from one side. but to no avail. So I tried the other side with more frustration and no better result. I contemplated using a scissor to cut the plastic open. but then I would have to clean the scissor. since all the residual butter would be transferred to the scissor creating a mess. I was surprised that all this hype and commercial about bowl popcorn really amounts to such bad packaging. Then. I forcefully pried open the plastic and got hot residual vapors on my fingers. Boy. what a scalding experience it was!! But I endured the agony so as to try this new popcorn.<br /><br />Taste: Popcorn kernels were large and uniform. and so were popped popcorn. It smelled very buttery. very aromatic indeed. They were crunchy. buttery and crisp. However. I could not have distinguished this final product from the regular Orville Redenbacher popcorns from regular paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this product tastes the same as regular same brand paper bag product. why am I spending 3 times more money to buy this item? So that I could just eat from a bowl instead of a paper bag? Now I am not a dodo and neither are regular Amazon customers looking for a better bang for their buck. so then what on the earth would make one shell out more money? I am amazed at the marketing department at work here. Do they really think that giving people bowl instead of a paper bag would somehow cast a Harry Potter like spell on us and force us to buy this product on a regular basis? Well guess again marketing guys. as far as I am concerned. No Popcorn Bowl for me. If you like the idea of eating your popcorn from a paper bowl. and if you are willing to put up with the inconvenience and mess and higher price. then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Clear instructions<br />2) Tempting packaging<br />3) Giant uniform popcorn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) EXPENSIVE<br />2) No easy way to tear apart the plastic top off the final popcorn bowl<br />3) Did I mention EXPENSIVE
37709,B004PXEZAE,AQJSMLYHE6GN4,StarReviewer SR,4/4,1316649600,Great Idea - Terrible Execution,The idea of a popcorn bag that turns into a bowl is simply brilliant! I was sick of having to either get my hands covered with grease or clean the large bowl I'd dump my popcorn into. So I got these as soon as I saw them in the grocery store. Here are the problems;<br />What's worse than a hot. oily paper bag? Very hot. oily PLASTIC. The plastic absorbs heat more than paper. and it's the part you're expected to pull off to get to the popcorn! Ouch! Burnt my fingers more than once. and when I didn't. had to wait and let it get cold-ish.<br />The bowl is made of the same paper as the bag. and more flimsy. so you don't avoid getting grease everywhere. Unlike the bag. the bowl does not contain the popcorn. The popcorn reaches the very top of the bowl and falls out.<br /> I'm going back to bags.
37719,B004PXEZAE,A1J3DMSJBF2B8N,fmsshepperd,0/0,1335052800,perfect,I love these bowls they make for a great snack at work and I don't end up with greasy buttery hands like i did with normal bags.
37720,B004PXEZAE,A21BNKXAQY9AHF,Nathan Totten,0/0,1328400000,Pop Up Bowl is Terrible,The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally. about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last. I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall. this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

37745,B0014EW58G,A2I1BMCDS82V25,P. M. Furry moonslight,0/1,1278028800,Slightly Disappointed,I've bought this soup from amazon.com in the past and the shipment was in perfect condition upon arrival.  This last time (ordered May 15. 2010). some of the cans were dented.  The shipping carton was in very good condition and there were no dents in the box at all -- just in several of the cans.  Not sure whether the manufacturer. amazon.com or the shipper is the cause of the dents.  I just ordered another case and I'm hoping all the cans will be totally dent-free like the first shipment I received.
37748,B004TZ2O0Q,A1SPVNAK9HBTAT,Special Education Teacher,0/0,1312243200,Contains MSG!,I like the taste of this dressing. but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines. which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer.
37769,B000KNDAZO,A2YMCPP3KW9IXU,USMC85,5/5,1299369600,Nice price from Amazon,The jury is still out about the efficacy of curcumin (found in turmeric) as a treatment for cancer or Alzheimer's. Not enough testing has been done yet. But it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for about 4000 years. and there seems to be less cases of cancer and Alzheimer's in South Asia where it is consumed. So. who knows? I like the color it gives the food. and I don't even notice any change in taste to the foods I put it on. I try to sneak it into just about everything from roasted vegetables to fish/shrimp and to rice.
37783,B000LKVDO6,A31RULW0KNYJ5H,LA,0/0,1345420800,Tasty Vegetarian Food,This is an excellent vegetarian Indian dish without preservatives. The only ingredients are potatoes. tomatoes. butter. capsicum. green peas. onions. garlic. salt. spices and ginger.<br /><br />It's a bit soupy. so you might want to pair it with a dish that has bigger chunks. The dish is very easy to prepare and will satisfy the Indian craving.
37784,B000LKVDO6,A1V4KHN1SPG1PS,kris,0/0,1337126400,pretty good,if you like indian food. like curry and want a quick meal this is for you.  i think it is vegetarian also.  i mix it with a minute rice microwave white rice and if i have some leftover cooked cauliflower i might smash that up a bit and add that also.  better price than i could get in a store so i buy it on amazon on the subscribe plan and get free shipping.
37788,B000LKVDO6,A27GVNKXDNQVNS,Budget Fashionista Budget Fashionista,0/0,1302912000,I've had better,I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce.  If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste.  I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those. in my opinion. are much better and cost far less.
37790,B000LKVDO6,A13V8Z7UJIRAG5,M. VanVickle,0/0,1297123200,A favorite.,This is so far my favorite packaged curry. Its a bit spicy and goes great with rice. I also usually make garlic bread with it and it makes a great meal. Definitely worth the price and very quick and easy to make.

I've long since moved to Utah and have been craving them like crazy but couldn't find them anywhere. But here they are. as delicious as ever! I brought some to work and people were fighting over them since they're so good. Not overly sweet or citrusy. and with plenty of almonds. these are worth every cent.

One of the lids was off one of the jars and the Ghee was all over everything.

The best way I can convey the taste is if you took cinnamon. apple juice and herbs and mixed them together. except you did it just with tea ingredients... no sugar or sweetener added. Both the caffeine free and caffeinated versions of this tea are excellent.

We used to be able to get it locally. but it has become less available over the last year.  I searched several stores before checking amazon.

37902,B000F6SNPS,A12MVVDKHK1QA0,Jon,4/8,1280188800,Artificial Flavor!,Bought this tea only to find out that the third ingredient is Artificial Flavor. even though the front of the box has the word Natural on it and the packaging certainly gives the appearance of a natural product.  I called Good Earth and spoke to the manager of consumer affairs to find out what chemical they were putting into the flaver.  Guess what.  That information is proprietary.  Guess the artifical chemicals they are pumping into their tea are bad enough that they won't even relase that information to their consumers.  Shame on you GoodEarth!<br /><br /><a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6SNPS>Good Earth Original Caffeine Free. Tea Bags. 18-Count.

That is exactly why I wouldn't buy it. I was sooo angry when I got it. will send it back.<br />Update: got a refund from Amazon. they're great. Hope the product description will be changed too.
37929,B000F6SNPS,A242RMW3BAUXJL,S. Chen Dog-Ma,2/2,1347408000,Digusting. couldn't even finish a cup,Like many others I have loved this tea for decades. both my husband and I would drink it everyday.  We used to get it from Costco and then no longer could. Found it at our local Sprouts. but in a new purple packaging.  Went home to enjoy a cup with my husband and he took one sip and put it down and refused to drink any more of it.  I tried to continue to drink it. but gave up on it after about a half a cup. It really tastes artificial with very little of the beloved cinnamon taste. I am not even going to dontate this to the food bank as it is garbage and so it is going into the garbage.  The packaging was very deceptive New Look Same Great Taste.  Sadly. I no longer trust this company.
37932,B000F6SNPS,A132XTTD5CDSW0,Daniel K. Henwood,2/2,1344643200,Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Taste has changed,I have been getting the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine-Free tea for several months now on a subscription (pack of 6). and usually drink two to three tea bags a night. I don't know when they changed the tea to include 'Natural and Artificial' flavors. but the taste of the tea I got in July has totally changed for the worse. and I can't drink it! The only way I can describe the way it tastes is that it reminds me of burnt wiring. I opened up a second box (of the six) and tried one of tea bags in that box. and it's the same thing: it's undrinkable.<br /><br />I am really bummed out. because it was my favorite tea. Unfortunately. it can't be returned. so I've got boxes of the tea that I can't drink.<br /><br />I may try a box of the Organic Caffeine-Free version. but from the reviews it doesn't sound like it's got as much flavor as the Original blend.
37939,B000F6SNPS,A3I2RCIKVVJNC5,bajadudes,6/8,1260921600,artificial goodness,I used to LOVE this tea and was excited to rediscover it.  However. I only recently noticed that artificial ingredients are listed. and are 3rd in line ~ even before cinnamon!  Definitely negates the benefits of drinking tea. in my opinion. and I will be sticking with 100% natural products in the future.
37967,B000F6SNPS,A2DVJHUKC8Q37B,James Deirmendjian,0/0,1347062400,Helps with sinus infection,I find that the sweet and spicy tea helps - and this is my suspicion - to thin out mucus and make it run clear when I'm in the midst of a severe sinus infection. Not only that. but it seems that it does so as good if not better than any herbal tea advertised as helping with respiratory ailments. The ingredient profile offers a potential explanation: in addition to the dreadful artificial flavor that some reviewers seem to be getting hung up about. the tea contains rooibos. chicory root. rosehips. cinnamon. peppermint. lemongrass. papaya leaves. chamomile. panax ginseng leaves. anise seed. dandelion root. ginger root. orange peel and orange oil. I suspect that the aromatic herbs and the papaya are what really help to cut the snot. So. to my fellow sinus sufferers. I implore you to put this in your pot and brew it. And let me know on via review on Amazon if you share the same suspicions. EDIT: I'm not sure if it's the vasoconstrictive effect from the mild amount of caffeine in the caffeinated version of this tea. versus the herbal formulation. that was responsible for its decongestant effect.
37980,B000F6SNPS,A19AHLTHRSRA1R,Jeff in Germany Jeff,0/0,1322352000,A spicy. sweet. strong blend... good anytime!,I normally only drink tea when I'm sick. This tea is the exception! There's nothing like it. I drink it whenever and gladly serve it to guests.<br /><br />Back in the late 70's and 80's I always enjoyed this tea at Good Earth Restaurants in California. which was their signature drink. served hot or iced. The tea is obviously one of the only things that remains from that restaurant.<br /><br />The tea is incredibly sweet. needing no sugar or sweetener and it's strong enough that two bags can easily make a carafe of 4-5 cups. You can find it in supermarkets in California. but not in Florida. I have it delivered to Florida then bring it back with me to Germany.  It's great that I can order it in quantity from Amazon. I buy more than I need because I like to give boxes of the tea as gifts. Now I've got more than a few friends hooked!
37982,B000F6SNPS,A119EB7PX28N7U,MarkAnthonyC,0/0,1307145600,Good Earth..Great Tea,This is a very tasty spice blend. that needs no augmentation (sugar etc).<br />It's a 'spiced' blend but quite nice. It's caffeine free. so it won't keep anyone up at nights. but also feels FULL BODIED so it's a good breakfast tea for those of you trying to break the 'habit'. Try it at your local store first. then buy in bulk. 6 packs. (you'll be surprized at how quickly it goes). Thanks Amazon.
37985,B000F6SNPS,AXTVRQLQBM3PQ,Mary-ann Rich ladycoralee,0/0,1305763200,sweet tea without chemicals or sugar,I  brew up the tea for iced tea to drink during the day instead of diet sodas.  It is very sweet tasting without the chemicals of diet drinks.  I also understand that the cinnamon helps to regulate my blood sugar from any carbohydrates that I take in.  I no longer find myself craving candies or desserts since I have been drinking this daily.

My daughter-in-law found it on Amazon & ordered it for her & me ! I really do drink a cup every morning! Great product & thanks to Amazon a great price!One tip for ordering: make sure you order correctly! There is a caffeine free herbal & another w/ real tea & caffeine.

38021,B0012AOIY6,A1ZSJNSRZCNCS1,CJ C,8/8,1245888000,It's Like a Good Chili!,I bought these not sure what to expect.  When I tried them. they taste just like a good chili without the vegetables.  This makes these beans great side dish to a vegetable or whatever.  These are a nice option in addition to the regular Eden beans. which are the very best beans.  Not to mention they are BPA free.  These are very good. as are all Eden products.
38031,B004DJ243U,A21H6UUF9CCM1C,Clyde Waters,0/0,1347667200,Not that great at all,I bought this tea as a gift for someone who had it at a tea and liked it. Since it came in six canisters. they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark. no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea. no matter how much tea you use. it still stays light and has a grassy. nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it. I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very. very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing. no leaves in sight. just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar. any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better. You may be very underwhelmed by this tea compared to them.
38049,B000R7XBF2,AKOCTZQVAFCOZ,Jose,0/0,1334966400,Very good potato chips,It is a great potato chip product eventhough I prefer Pringles. I don't consider them the best chips because the cheesy flavor does get somewhat repetetive. but overall it istill is a very good product.
38056,B002OXIZOE,A267U5ACM1VWHW,AshleyMonique,1/2,1314144000,Yum,I am generally not a fan of cookies that come from big brands like chips ahoy because they tend to be crunchy and dry and they never live up to the warm delicate cookies that come out of my oven when I bake... and what's the point of eating a snack and taking in all those calories if it isn't perfect! joking... kinda.<br />However. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. They are truly soft cookies. I wouldn't necessarily call them chewy as they are designated on the package but I still think they are really tasty. They are especially good after warming them in a microwave (And of course. with Milk!) I have even successfully passed them off as home-made by putting them on a plate and sending them to school with aluminum foil wrapped around it.<br />Bottom-line: Great Cookie!
38074,B000ZE9NM2,A17MINCRXDK9FL,Tammy Lyn Richardson,0/0,1325376000,very pleased,I received the products on time and was very pleased how they were packed. I bought these as a gift and would order again from Das. Thanks
38077,B000ZE9NM2,A3AMZ9D2IMT2Y1,Texputter,0/1,1299110400,If you like salt.......,Our purchase from Das Salt was received quickly. and we have really enjoyed our first taste of gourmet salts. Each jar of the sampler trio has a nice portion of salt and I now reach for them regularly when cooking. Since all of the gourmet salts I researched online seemed a bit pricey to me. I feel like this one is a decent value considering the size of the portions compared to others. I recommend Das Salt and will buy from them again. The only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars is because of price.
38098,B000E18CS2,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,Amaranth music fan,0/0,1254960000,East meets West,Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles are versatile. They cook quickly and well. When I've made my own pad thai.they've proved useful. They have a good neutral flavor.and soak in sauces easily. They're also durable.and hold up good in stir frying. Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles are a must for Asian cooking! ESPECIALLY stir fries!
38125,B004T419WQ,A3E29RUZWOOBQZ,Jason,0/0,1338854400,My Favorite BBQ sauce period.,I found out about Sonny's BBQ sauce from a former customer who is quite a fine BBQ cook. He always made his own sauce but stopped once he found Sonny's. So...I had to try as is was previously available at my local Sam Club (not this year sad to say). Anyway I tried it and LOVE IT!!! Bought 3 more of the large bottles the next time I went back to Sams just in case they ran out. Great on Chicken and Pork. Glad I found it here on Amazon.

The picture shows a jar/shaker/glass or plastic/container...and what you get is a mylar bag that cannot be resealed. It must not come with an oxygen absorber in the sealed mylar pouch either. as the expiration date on the pouch is January 2014.
38187,B0027UQYZQ,ATXM8O8KGQVMB,Suzan Plummer Suzan,5/7,1311811200,Not the best and does take up room.,My daughter wanted 3 of these so she could make my 1st grandbaby her food. I bought them and then 3 boxes of the One Step reusable stackable Fresh and Freeze as i thought the latter would be better.<br />These are hard to remove when frozen and you end up touching the other sections and contaminating them. You have to run hot water over the section you want to remove. You cannot see thru the lid if you put different food in a container.<br />These are way too expensive when you can buy the other Fresh and Freeze by One Step Ahead that can go from the freezer. microwave then the dishwasher.<br />I do not recommend wasting your $$$ when yoy can have the same results with ice cube trays covered to freeze than placing them in baggies. Idea is to make the food freeze it and leave it until ready to use:)
38199,B0027UQYZQ,A2RL1RS6PWUHWI,Jennifer Ackerman,0/0,1335484800,Great for things other than baby food as well,My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet. but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups. popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect-sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone. not just those wanting to use it for baby food.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated. it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely. this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I like this so much. in fact. I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough. I have a feeling I will be investing in another though.
38224,B0027UQYZQ,A2803KK3ZW27FC,bec10,1/4,1289779200,Lid was chipped but I like the product,Came to me with a chipped lid.  I wrote an email to the company to see what I could do and no one responded.

38249,B000634HD2,A1UPWVFF2P5QDC,Lilliana Mendez,0/0,1330387200,Miracle Food,I have two cocker spaniels. both got frequent ear infections. one age 6 has had allergies for well over 5 years. thousands of dollars. Vet visits and food trials and nothing helped. I started using Natural Balance Limited Ingredient and noticed a slight improvement on his skin and not nearly as much scratching. He had scratched off all of the fur on his neck and chest and was continuously gnawing on his paws and forelegs.<br /><br />Recently moved to a new area that does not have a pet shop close enough to continue to purchase Natural Balance. so I signed on to my Amazon account and looked up Natural Balance. Read so many good reviews on the Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula I decided to give it a try. MIRACULOUS Stuff!!! I bought a small bag at a Petco a few towns over from where I live. scratching was cut in half within a week. So I ordered the large 28 lbs bag from Amazon. A little over 3 weeks and the fur is growing back!! It looks like a soft peach fuzz and he is barely scratching at all these days.<br /><br />Neither dog has had an ear infection since being on this formula either.<br /><br />Love Natural Balance!!!
38267,B004946ZV6,A36WGHR8TO5DKT,Goldwave shopper,0/0,1344384000,Surprisingly good!,I admit that I had doubts when ordering these.  I figured they might be fun for a quick breakfast on occasion.  They shipped promptly. well packaged. arriving in good condition.  Package note said they would only keep for about one week.  I intended to put mine in the freezer anyway.  Each was soft and tender feeling.  You could easily squish them in handling.  That's a good sign - they aren't tough or stale.<br /><br />I expected an uber sugar bomb.  To my surprise. the danish/dough part is less sweet than most other danishes I've had. making for a nice contrast with the sweet filling.  The filling has a true and tasty cherry flavor. although the cheese part doesn't come across very clearly.  The icing on top isn't overly sweet or gloppy either. and did not leave a sticky mess on my hands.  The other thing I was happy about was that there is no scary chemically flavors. and the sweetness seems natural. like sugar. rather than corn syrupy.  For example. I dislike Entemann's products because I think they have a weird overly sweet and chemical quality; I would say that these are better.<br /><br />So - yes it's a sweet. mass-market prepackaged snack cake of a danish - but it's a very good one.
38269,B000PC3A2I,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,Noname,0/0,1309564800,For restaurant quality ribs,I just made beef ribs today with Hunt's Hickory and Brown Sugar Barbeque Sauce.  Just cook the ribs for four hours at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. turning and basting every half hour.  The sauce cooks right in -- delicious. restaurant quality ribs.  Sauce is thick. rich. sweet and savory.  It takes lots of time to babysit those ribs. but well worth the effort.  Served them to my in-laws who love fine food.  They were pleased. which says a lot.
38293,B007R1PGVS,A1KB18RBNOPZD5,G. J. Burk,2/2,1208131200,Great for keeping you on the go!,Zipfizz. Tastes good and keeps you moving all day .Zipfizz is loaded with energy and is great for those who lack the required rest from the night before.
38307,B007R1PGVS,A3RGQ4R9M2ZGWY,J-Reezy,3/4,1260230400,Great energy booster,Ultimately. I think personal preference is going to play the main role in whether or not you will like Zipfizz over any other energy drink.  That said. here is what I have experienced<br /><br />Energy Boost<br />For me it gives a nice boost of energy. equivalent to a full cup of coffee.  It seems to last around 5 hours for me without a crash at the end.  I think this is where individuals will have the most variance. as caffeine reacts differently in different people depending on the product.  For example. I don't like what a Diet Coke does to me but I like this.<br /><br />Flavor<br />The flavor is great because it is not overpowering and not to subtle either.  Since it is a mix. you can add more or less water to get the flavor you desire.  I have tried grape. orange. and lemonade.  Grape is my favorite. although an interesting twist on orange is to add a bit of vanilla creamer - it makes for a tasty Creamsicle flavored treat<br /><br />Zipfizz vs 5-hour energy<br />5-hour energy also has the desired energy boost for me. however. it tends to leave me with cotton mouth.  Zipfizz does not do that since it is mixed with water.  I prefer the added hydration.<br /><br />Lastly. often times I only use half of a canister with 16 oz of water.  This helps maximize the value of the product and for me only half of the canister is plenty of an energy boost.
38308,B007R1PGVS,A2L81NJ3C18VZH,healthgirl,5/7,1328140800,Not All Natural,This product works but the advertising is misleading. Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree. and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China. where it's made from corn. it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But.on the ingredients list. xylitol is the last ingredient. meaning. that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?
38312,B007R1PGVS,A2JAQL1YN6Q9ND,Philip Veech,0/0,1348617600,Zipfizz,Berry is one of the best flavours I have tried.  Just wish it wasn't more expensive then some of the other ones.  I enjoy zip fizz everyday.
38346,B007R1PGVS,A2KYP94KP8D09Q,Brandon,1/3,1270080000,Almost. but not quite,There was this one energy drink I had been buying from Wal-mart.  It was the only place I could find it.  Then one day. it was pulled from the shelf in every single Wal-mart within an hours drive.  And that's a lot of Wal-marts!  This energry drink was quite possibly the best I had ever and will ever taste.  I could get a 10-pack for $1.50.  That price just couldn't be beat and it tasted great too.  The only place you can get it now is from a somewhat shady looking website that sells 10-packs for like $15.  So there I was energy drink-less.  I started looking online for alternatives and I came across Zipfizz.  I figured I'd check some local stores for small packs to sample and give it a try.<br /><br />I purchased this product as somewhat of a blind buy.  I had tried the orange. citrus. and pink lemonade by purchasing small three packs at some of the local stores.  However. I wanted to try the grape and the berry.  The only way I was going to be able to do that was to buy them online.  So I went for the berry.  About the best I can say is it's not horrible.  Just like the others I had tried. it had a very strong B-vitamin taste to it.  It was very overpowering in this flavor.  Having tried those other flavors. I would have to say this is probably my least favorite.  As for the rest. the orange is definitely top notch.  There's hardly any B-vitamin taste to it as it is masked by the orange flavor.  The orange sort of reminds me more of orange popsicles or an orange flavored drink than it does of an actual orange.  But it's still pretty good.  The same can be said for citrus. it covers the B-vitamin flavor well.  It has a similar taste to the orange. but it tasted like there was some lemon and lime mixed in there.  It was pretty good.  The pink lemonade is pretty good. if you can get past the fact that it's a fizzy drink.  And that's exactly what it tasted like. a fizzy pink lemonade.  It just had a minor B-vitamin after taste to it.  I haven't yet tried the grape. but would still like to.  After my experience with the berry though. I'm not hopeful.  Orange is good enough for me for now and I've actually found it cheaper locally in the big 20-pack.
38350,B007R1PGVS,A2FJSE52ZWU84T,sosmom,1/6,1229126400,thought it would be better,i looked forever for a good. healthy energy drink- thought this would be it but i thought the flavor was yucky and i felt jittery and then just tired.  i love peppod and will be going back to that.
38361,B000FZ0TL0,A3QA0BBQW08DLZ,Mc m0c21,0/0,1334793600,My favorite go to jerky,First time I got this was 4 years ago and I've been coming back for more ever since. This is a great flavor with a good kick from the pepper. If you're a pepper lover. this is for you. I usually don't like honey in my jerky/meat but I don't really even notice it in this. This is by far my favorite flavor that Buffalo Bills make.
38413,B00473SSPK,A22SPUDFSTWTGV,Lee Miller,1/5,1304812800,Mild or Hot?,My rating of 1 Star does not reflect my opinion of Peppadew peppers. it is intended to cause Amazom (and Divina) to edit their ads for the 70 oz. package to identify this 70 oz. package of Peppadews as either mild or hot. This is important. if not critical information to the customer when deciding whether or not to purchase this item.
38451,B005MGDP86,A3PCFMJ9L2NWS9,Joan Hough Jo Cook,0/0,1348185600,Pine Salt,Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.  I use this salt for all my salt uses including cooking but cut the amount in half since it is so salty.  This salt is not processed like other salts so is not iodized if you need that process.  We like it much better that our regular table or kosher salt.
38462,B005MGDP86,A9TPV4O2YQJXO,loves purses,0/0,1334534400,very good,Terrific salt.  Very pretty too.  If all you have ever tasted is salt from the grocery store then you need to try this.  You won't buy generic salt again.
38478,B005MGDP86,ARH4HV2DYHIA3,L. Goodson,1/2,1322524800,love this salt,I love this salt.  I prefer to use this salt over any other salt.  I recommend this salt.  It tastes great.
38485,B005MGDP86,A2Z8VUNSYMSUIQ,Miguel Ontiveros,5/12,1337731200,wow what a rip-off,When I opened the package. the salt did not look right. I compared it to some of the Himalayan salt I had from Whole foods and it was a lighter pink. Opened the bag and tasted it. It sure tasted like regular salt was added. Great price but you get what you pay for. Nice trick.
38491,B000H26J7E,A2U4I9500J8O28,Ralph,4/4,1301875200,Chocolate flavored wax,The new Lindt 70% tastes a lot like all the other waxy chocolate bars out there so if you like chewing on crayons you may like it. but if you really like chocolate you won't. It's really a shame they ruined a formerly excellent product.
38503,B000H26J7E,A2VV8IS6IXEN6Q,nycd,0/0,1342137600,So disappointing!,The 70% tastes like cheap Easter bunny chocolate. Green and Black I guess it will have to be. Sad though since the Lindt was very good in France.
38519,B004S036D6,AJSYLZGRSEFQ7,Home sweet,0/0,1349395200,Awesome Buy!!,The small cans in the store are so expensive!  These larger cans are a great savings - I love them!
38533,B005HTY8OS,A3BMQF6ZUXS638,Dorothy G. Schmidt prestonsmommy1229,1/1,1340409600,pretty good!,At first. I did not think this stuff was incredible. but someone told me to mix it with 6-8 oz of hot milk or 1/2 water. and 1/2 milk...it was sooooooo much better like that!  I have been drinking the line of OG products now for 5 months. and I feel great...sleep better. on 1/2 the dose of prozac I've been on for 8 years. and just have more energy.  The milk definitely helps all of the products taste richer...try it! 8^)
38545,B003GSK4CW,A2Y0WPMC2QN5BT,Redheaded Reviewer,7/7,1319932800,Perfect,I bought these to go with my sugar free syrups that I bought in a sampler pack.  The pumps work very well and make sampling or mixing the syrups with my coffee a real treat.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that they would ship 6 instead of 5 to match the sampler pack.<br /><br />A tip: Before inserting the pump fully into a newly opened bottle. pump the pump to load the pump with syrup...otherwise it will overflow.  If you pump it full of syrup (2 pumps on mine) before inserting it fully. you won't waste any syrup.
38553,B003GSK4CW,ABMFLVJYS1XAN,Lewis Lafferty,2/2,1326067200,Syrup Pump,The only problem with these pumps is you have to be very careful when putting in the new bottle to keep from wasting product. It also needs to come packed six to a package since the rack is designed to hold six bottles and the variety pack has six flavors.
38556,B003GSK4CW,A26OCQMLKBQCN0,Pamela A. Staul Pam S.,1/1,1326844800,works well for the SF Torani syrups,You do have to either use a little of the syrup for this pump to be put into the bottle. I don't want less syrup though. :)
38557,B003GSK4CW,A3A6DA7E4J7PZV,Bonnie Blue crazy camera lady,1/1,1323907200,SYRUP PUMP,The Torani Syrup Pump is just great.  I can now get the right amount of syrup in my coffee cup instead of pouring out too much or not enough.
38560,B003GSK4CW,A1752DLH60KYMK,MK,1/1,1321747200,Makes adding syrup easy,My counter is starting to look like a coffee house.  I use sugar-free syrups and my husband uses regular. so we have a few each.  These pumps make it easy and less messy (if you are careful).  Also easy to put exactly the same amount in each time without making more dishes dirty. They are machine washable too (top).
38562,B003GSK4CW,A3DOZ9XDTUYQSU,Sally Beth,1/1,1320105600,5 Pack of sweet delight,Great price & product! How much easier it makes my morning cup of coffee or my afternoon latte to not have to screw off a top & get syrup all over the kitchen.  Just a few pumps from the Torani syrup pump & I'm through.  Thanks Torani & Amazon!
38566,B003GSK4CW,A3HSB8Y6B328HH,B. White Movie-holic,1/1,1311811200,Torani Pump - Works great!,What can I say?  I bought the 5-pack of the Torani Syrup pump for my additional bottles of syrup I bought and they work great.  Hard to beat the price for the 5-pack. also!!
38571,B003GSK4CW,A3FY3S8KMC5X82,Michael E. Bohl,0/0,1346544000,Great pump for bottles purchased for.,Pump purchased for flavor bottles. was made to fit them.  Pumps are very good. action is good. delivers about 25 ML per pump.  Great for a couple of pumps per drink.
38599,B004S036DG,A2MHCXLP3SHOWT,vroom35,0/0,1344470400,Not spicy at all. Quite greasy.,First time buying this and won't buy it again. I've tried the low fat Silverado chili and it is just as mild as this one. Difference is it's not loaded with unnecessary lard and I can add my own heat. This one is not the least bit hot. If a company is going to market something as 'Ignited by Habanero' it better have Habanero in it. I've had Campbell's Firehouse Chili and that one is a little bit spicier and has less calories. Still prefer the low fat Silverado though.<br /><br />I'll be giving away the rest of this 6 pack.
38612,B000OYMGMC,A1KJZDARW77PRA,Beader,14/18,1294704000,Misrepresentation,I ordered these tootsie roll pops thinking they were the original flavors (orange.cherry.chocolate.grape.&?). What I got was green apple (which is gross by the way!).strawberry (barely ok).cherry & chocolate (the only 2 good flavors in the bunch). blue raspberry. & watermelon (another gross flavor!). The advertisement blurb on the amazon site indicated that the flavors were the original flavors (orange etc.). I didn't want to ship the whole order back so I just used the ones in the order (from the Toy Burg supplier) and am ordering again from another supplier that I had previously used that represented the correct box (this one being The Candy Co.). So be cautious who you order from because the amazon site does not indicate the exact flavors. I had to call to find out why I got the (wrong) misrepresented flavors & it wasn't easy even then to find out why I got the wrong type. The main lesson here is check your supplier and if all else fails you may have to use trial & error to get the correct item.
38619,B000OYMGMC,A3QOSCJ0BMMB5S,Daran Chapman,0/0,1343779200,Now vs Then,I received my first box of these a year ago. and have ordered two since then. The first box was excellent and I'd give five stars for that experience. The second box seemed stale. and I was a little surprised about that. because I didn't even know they could get stale... but the sucker bits get a bit more brittle. and the tootsie roll inside gets hard as rock. I received my third box a week ago. figuring that the second box was a fluke. and these seem even worse. They're still alright. but not great. I'm undecided on whether or not I'll get another box. as I seem to be detecting a downward trend in quality.
38635,B000OYMGMC,ANLOC4I8MY0D6,K. THOMAS Kathy,0/2,1264809600,For Halloween,I bought these for Halloween  and with the cost of Halloween candy if you have to give out a lot this is the way to go. It was 10.00 a box for 100. I get about 160-200 children. My only complaint there seemed to be more orange then the other flavors. or maybe the kids just didnt care for orange. In comparison to what I was paying for for Halloween candy at the stores this was definately a much better value
38642,B001VNEII0,A2F7ZDCTFIW8S2,SELLER seller,5/5,1333929600,Waste of $17.00 but maybe not next time,Now. my neighbor reportedly used this very same catnip (Frontier) and had excellent results.  He even gave me some and I had excellent results.  So I bought my own bag. right here.  Not so fortunate.  I gave my neighbor some and he did not have excellent results either. So that weakens the excuse that not all cats react to catnip. In fact. it reinforces the fact that not all catnip is created the same......
38683,B000ILEVWO,A281E9Z9INZ5BV,Amis,2/2,1249603200,Just as good as I remembered!,If you love HP sauce (you probably wouldn't be looking at buying it in bulk unless you do) this is definitely the way to go.  It tastes as good as it ever did and seems to keep without deteriorating at all (in a cool place but not necessarily refrigerated).  My family loves it on many savory items (anything from breakfast eggs to burgers and steak) and we add it to bean dishes and homemade barbeque sauce too.<br /><br />Unreservedly 5 stars!<br /><br />Just wish we could buy Lea and Perrins Worchestershire sauce and Marmite in bulk too...
38702,B00445TYHM,ACP9CKCWR3U0M,A. Daniels,1/1,1306713600,Coconut milk ok for the price. probably won't reorder,I buy a lot of coconut milk.  I use it like regular milk in coffee. baking. etc. so I am always looking for a good deal.  This is a very good price.  However. the coconut milk is a little grainy in texture and doesn't have the creamy mouth-feel that full fat coconut milk usually has.  It would be probably ok if used only in cooking.  It is very separated (part solid. part liquid) and it was difficult to blend it to a smooth consistency.  Overall - 3 stars - decent product for the price
38733,B002DHUCEM,AEYYRO0ERDP3A,M. A. Draper,0/0,1264982400,Breakfast drinks good all day,When I am in a rush at lunch time. I drink one of these.  They are filling. fast and portable.  They also taste good.  When I buy the multiple pack. the cost is bearable.  And when Amazon offers free  shipping. it's even better.  Would def buy again.

38749,B000EGZ9AQ,A2PFMNK8C2R2DX,Ruth d.,1/4,1196640000,Jasmati white rice,The white Jasmati rice is not as aromatic or flavorful as the white Basmati rice. Don't know why - suppose because one is grown in rice paddys overseas and the Jasmati Organic is grown in American soil and conditions?<br />The brown Jasmati rice is great - ! - more flavorful and smell is wonderful.
38751,B0017363E6,A3GXKA5UKW72C7,James Sidbury ready to retire,9/9,1346198400,Somewhat misleading ad,i just got my Gourmet Popcorn Variety 3-pack (45 oz per pack) and wanted to make sure that other potential purchasers were aware of what they were buying.  There are three plastic bottles of popcorn in the package.  Each bottle contains 15 ounces of popcorn for  a total of 45 ounces for the entire order.  When I ordered the popcorn. I thought I was getting 3 45 ounce containers.  This would be a little over 3 dollars per pound which is reasonable for gourmet popcorn.  Instead this works out to somewhat more than 10 dollars per pound.  I considered returning it. but as a popcorn lover. I decided to keep it.  I may amend my review after popping some of it to see if it's worth the price.

38784,B000EGZ9AG,A1WOMXOEX90ARI,Avid Camper WS,8/9,1258502400,Good. But Not 5-Star...,We like all kinds of rice. especially brown and basmati.  This rice is very good. but not 5-star.  It arrived quickly and in very good condition. mostly due to the excellent packaging.  It is the amongst the FRESHEST rice we've ever purchased (and we've purchased from the source).  It has a wonderful taste and aroma.  After cooking several batches. both on the stove and in our Zoji Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker. we like it. but find the texture to be just okay.  We've had better textured varieties in the past.  The grains are on the short side for long grain and they explode a little too much. even when we used less water.  It is very good. for brown rice; just not quite as good. for brown basmati.  We would buy it again. but not as our only source of brown basmati.
38806,B000EGZ9AG,A2WQ4FT0CMDSUI,Profane Poet,0/0,1317859200,Alter Water For Electric Stovetop Cooking,Eh. OK rice. Flavor was a bit mild for me. Prefer Lundberg. Very fresh rice. though! If you prefer the taste of white rice over brown. you may like this rice.<br /><br />I only make my rice on stovetop. using stainless steel cookware on an electric stove. If you use that method of rice cooking and use the suggested amount of water on the jar. it will turn out mushy. Using 1 c rice and 1 1/2 c water works much better.
38807,B000EGZ9AG,A24BZKB2P3IBLI,James W. Magill,0/0,1314748800,Texmati Organic Brown Rice,This rice is the best and the fact that it is grown in Texas is a real plus to us. I never would eat brown rice until I tried this brown rice and now it is the only rice I eat. Love it!

However. there is a trick to cooking this rice:<br /><br />1. Bring two cups of water to boil.<br /><br />2. Add one cup of rice and stir.<br /><br />3. Cover the rice and put stove on medium/low for 40 minutes.<br /><br />4. Turn off heat completely but keep rice on burner for 20 minutes.<br /><br />It comes out perfect every time. perfect texture. not mushy and deeeeelicous!!!

38898,B001ELL6KM,A2VE19E4T04BOO,rockets63,6/9,1278028800,BAD GRITS,Do not buy this product. It is a huge disappointment. Not as good as the Supermarket brands like Quaker and Albers. not even close to Bob's Red Mill. Gummy and mushy with an odd/off flavor regardless of the cooking method. Roughly equivalent to the tubes of pre-cooked polenta but more trouble to prepare. The 3 unopened boxes are going to the Food Bank. if you're homeless they might be acceptable.
38904,B001ELL6KM,AMR1G2BUMC7XE,Margaret D. Elmhorst,2/4,1257984000,Really Good,No more white bland grits.  This makes absolutely the best shrimp and grits as well as polenta!

This product. however. sorta scares me now that I've tried it.  They are dyed red and don't have a sausage-like consistency at all.  That is. this isn't a hard sausage.  It's like highly processed meat (including pork hearts!).  Under the red skin. they're really mushy. almost like pât&eacute; or a soft hot dog.  An individually wrapped red. soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good. but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.  Make sure to try one before buying in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not condemning the product or people who like it.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Your mileage may vary.
38926,B001IZHSWO,A2OU9ZYUHNDOOX,Michael Hirtes,0/2,1315785600,YUCK!,I have a question. Why do all of these pickled sausages HAVE to have hearts as an ingredient in them? That's freakin' disgusting!
38929,B000H7K5KQ,AORGKBNQZ83O8,MacGuffin MacGuffin,1/1,1335139200,A Gift from Oz,This caught my eye today while shopping and although it was a toss-up between green apple and mango. I went with the former. Not to belabor the point but this is wonderful licorice--nice chew with a bright. natural flavor cut to a shortish length that affords the satisfaction of holding it to bite off a chew...but only once (not a bad thing--it keeps one from compulsively popping bite-size pieces). I can't speak for the other flavors (YET) but green apple's a winner. clearly due to the care the manufacturer has put into her product which includes simple ingredients of fine quality. And FWIW. it's both vegetarian and kosher. By all means. give Darrell Lea's licorice a try--I don't think you'll be sorry.<br /><br />Update: I just bought a bag of the strawberry and it ROCKS; it's even better than the green apple. Be advised. though. that the Darrell Lea strawberry that my local Trader Joe's carries is artificially flavored and in a small tub; the one I bought elsewhere is in a bag and clearly labeled NATURAL FLAVOR. Thanks to other reviewers for recommending strawberry!<br />Update again: tried the mango and while it was very nice. the strawberry--IMHO--continues to reign supreme. In fact. I intend to pick up another bag today. :)

I've given it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 because it doesn't live up to the other blends of Cafe Excellence that I have tried.  It is still better than most other coffees.
39024,B0026A30PY,A3QQNBBECTWY1H,henryxvi,9/10,1291680000,Don't buy this stuff.,Nielsen-Massey's Orange Blossom Water is dreadful -- primarily because it isn't orange blossom water at all. It's a mixture of chemicals with orange oil added. I bought it and will not use it in my cooking -- I'm afraid it'll ruin what I'm making. If you've used Monteaux in the past. be warned THIS IS NOT MONTEAUX!!
39035,B001KNAKKQ,AGVG47XP2XTBV,Sean Davis,1/2,1307923200,No catnip...,So. my Cat Grass Plus Catnip Seeds arrived today. looks exactly like the one pictured.<br /><br />Here's my problem:<br />Seller- Product contains Aged Pine Bark Peat Moss Perlite Vermiculite Hardwood Charcoal Plantagel and Nepeta Cataria (Catnip Seeds).<br />Package- Ingredients: Wheat or oat seed. vermiculite and Plantagel (potassium propenoate and propenamide copolymers). Plantagel is a non-toxic water absorption agent.<br /><br />Seems like I'm missing something here...<br /><br />Well. I'm going to keep it because my cats have had this kind of thing from the pet store before but. I really wanted catnip.
39049,B0056AL6G6,A2J95IYMDKZ7DD,Jared,0/0,1335398400,Simple. Quick & Tasty,These bars are a simple and quick way to get some fruit into your daily diet. The ingredients consist of 1 Apple and 3 Apricots. and That's It. The bars are small and will definitely not work as a meal supplement. but are great for an add-on to lunch or breakfast. or a small snack between meals. The only downside to the bars (and it is very minor unless you are picky) is that they are dark brown in color. but I would expect that when you mash fruits together and turn it into a bar.<br /><br />Overall. these bars taste great. and I would definitely recommend them to others.<br /><br />Other great flavors include:<br /><a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AL5BW>That's It.

I can take or leave Dr. Pepper soda. It's not bad. but I don't exactly seek it out. So I was not expecting that I'd really care much for this sauce.<br /><br />It's actually quite good! It excels as a dipping sauce. especially for chicken. Not bad on pulled pork either. I also tried it as a cooking sauce and was less impressed - not bad. but it really is best as a dipping sauce. As expected. it's pretty sweet. but has enough tang so you get a variety of flavors.<br /><br />While I still prefer my own homemade BBQ sauce. for a bottled version this is pretty good.
39073,B001AC87X4,A3C4D2C33MIYQ9,C. A. Timmerman Cat,1/2,1325116800,Dr. Who?,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. We are big Dr.Pepper fans. & I frequently use Dr. Pepper soda in my cooking.  When I saw the BBQ sauce. I thought perfect. I'll have it on hand & won't have to make it myself.  This is a MAJOR disappointment.  It's not sweet. it's more acid than I like. it doesn't taste at all like Dr. Pepper. there are no indications in the ingredients list that it is remotely related to Dr.Pepper. about the only thing I can say good about this stuff - it does bring some heat.  Save your money.  This is not what you're looking for!
39081,B000F3PJIA,ALMYQDKR4K7RS,Merrily Stenberg Merrily S. :  book junkie,5/5,1272758400,Just what I was looking for...,Whenever I get to the grocery. I have trouble remembering which noodles are the good ones for Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  This is a good product--perfect for my needs.  Plus they come packaged in small amounts so you can use what you need and keep the rest fresh.  Nice product.
39083,B000F3PJIA,A27NTH2Y9DAR31,Schuyler V. Johnson,4/5,1242691200,FABULOUS as a meal or snack,I have been eating these glass noodles since I was a child then rediscovered them in college. and we boil them for a few minutes then let them steep in the hot water for another 5 minutes until pliable. then we mix with soy sauce. sesame oil. rice vinegar and scallions. and some chicken or beef and water chestnuts. this is a fabulous treat and can be a snack or a meal. You can use either the seasoned rice vinegar which is sweet or the original. and go easy on the sesame oil. it is very strong and can overpower your dish. We also add a bit of canola oil. just a suggestion. I originally had these noodles at the Luau. a wonderful restaurant that we went to when I was a child and I have loved them ever since. Wonderful texture and take on the flavors you imbue them with. They can also be fried in very hot canola or peanut oil for a crunch in salads...very versatile and great to have on hand. When frying. be aware they expand tremendously and will blow up out of the pan if you do too many at once. Start small until you see how big they get.
39136,B0012271RA,A2B0ZJ5CYX49TN,Manu,2/2,1312934400,Not the best,...but it is edible.  I like the super saver free shipping mainly. otherwise I would purchase another brand.  This is emergency lunch that conveniently gets shipped directly to my office. where I keep it for when I do not have time to step out. but need to have protein.  Most cans are fine. but every now and then. you get a funky can of tuna. which doesn't look right.
39152,B001HWD2OG,AUOB0CQI9YJV7,luvamazon,1/1,1322179200,love that these are yogurt flavor!  my dog loves booda bones!,I have no problem w/my dog eating these.  He loves these booda bones. I had never seen the yogurt ones; he loves them.

39166,B001HWD2OG,A2DBQWLG9HU8N5,Beau,1/3,1310601600,disappointed,These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy. these were more like a snack.
39169,B000LKX1SW,A1GJ8M4YT8ZKLN,Annette,1/1,1256601600,There are two types of Edensoy Vanilla Soy Milk.,Edensoy Vanilla soy milk comes in fortified with vitamins. and regular without additional vitamins.  I love the regular unfortified vanilla soy milk.  It is especially delicious with cereal.  There may be some confusion about this product because it comes in two different versions.  The fortified version. which has vitamins and minerals added to it. I found to be terrible tasting because I could actually taste the vitamins and minerals.  (I take a vitamin pill every day. but I do not want that vitamin taste in my soy milk.)
39180,B003VYIZT0,A1I2FEZ8ZAAWCV,nelliek80 nelliek80,2/2,1343692800,Dented Cans,My one star rating above is not for the coconut milk itself but for the way the product arrived. I use this coconut milk all the time and was excited to see the price that Amazon was offering it at. but like one other reviewer reported all six of the cans came with dents...and not just tiny ones. The box they came in was in perfect condition so I can only come to a similar conclusion that Amazon is trying to offload the undesirable cans without disclosing their compromised condition. Pretty lame and shady if you ask me. My first thought was to return them. but apparently grocery items are not eligible for return.
39199,B000QSOT2G,A3UF8PP4XBW3GO,Margaret Shepherd,2/2,1297641600,Dogs love the taste,Two of my dogs have sensitive stomachs and they not only gobbled this down. but kept it down.  I mix it with Hill's Science diet kibble to give them some variety.  The down side is it does have a strong smell. but so does natural fish.  I wish it weren't as expensive. but it does beat having to clean up from a sensitive doggy tummy.
39205,B002KBKE1W,A3AE0PT28XBUT,f_train,0/0,1328140800,What won't she do for these treats?,My puppy loves Salmon Paws! I was given a free sample by the local pet food store and my puppy loved it! Yes it's more expensive than other treats out there and you don't get a lot. but it's quality - 100% salmon with no fillers. It's recommended that you refrigerate these treats because it's natural and it is fish. My dog is finicky with her food and treats and has rejected so many different treats that the pet stores in the area (with a no-questions asked return policy) let me open bags to let her try in the store just so I can save a trip coming back to return them (she's that bad!). So when I saw her get excited from just having a little bit of Salmon Paws. I just had to get it for her because it's so difficult finding stuff she likes.
39231,B0002YB21A,A1M5D0DG09UGVM,Bonne Maman,3/15,1185580800,Too expensive compared to La Tourangelle brand that is also produced in Japan,This is darker and richer than La Tourangelle but I grew tired of always running out and feeling terribly extravagent restocking it. It finally annoyed me too much that this bottle is difficult to clean for recycling.  The plastic cap cannot be removed from the glass bottle!
39239,B003ULJKAW,A2GKB4YFZGNAMA,Dempsey Boxer Lover,5/5,1300060800,Best mild tea ever.,This is the best tea I've ever tasted. It is mild--only slightly lemony. a little ginger taste. I drink it every day. all day long. After a year of drinking it. I'm still not tired of it. and I have tried to add other types. but they have all been rejected and given away. I guess I'm stuck on it. And since it's decaf. it's okay to drink a lot. so how can I go wrong? Especially when it contains all those wonderful antioxidants? I really like Numi's Gunpowder Green Tea. as well. but don't drink as much of it because of the caffeine.
39243,B003ULJKAW,A12W8NRSYR593I,David R. Fredrickson David R Fredrickson,0/1,1301702400,decent tea,sadly. i have become a Teavana tea drinker and i no longer order my teas from here in bulk but these were decent teas.

Very thick. use sparingly or just slather it on and take your punishment. It has a great tart/sweet flavor that shows through the habanero. Good stuff.
39285,B0000DG5AO,A2ENJ55MV49PMX,Andyski Andy,0/0,1285113600,Hot Sauce. Hot Review,Hey. if you like hot sauce and who doesn't. you'll love this!  And it has garlic. so it's the best of both worlds.  A little goes a long way.  I purchased this for myself as well as to give as a gift to several friends who enjoy hot sauces.
39323,B001228RNM,A21W24XP29TC8G,Opus,0/0,1325548800,Sweet Tea,Great product for iced tea just like you use at high priced coffee shops.  This bottle and pump is so much cleaner than using granulated sugar.
39330,B001XWNBWI,A2SA6LR78V49UV,OrangeCrush Still shooting with Film!,3/3,1294617600,The Only Way To Go!!,I am a HUGE fan of Chicago styled hot dogs and while my cousin was visiting us this summer. we got in this big discussion about them. You see he lives in Chicago and he told me that there was a brand of hot dogs in Chicago that was basically synonymous with the Chicago style hot dog. Well. he wound up sending us a huge package of them for Xmas. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to go shopping to get the rest of the ingredients. I dont know why. but for some reason all my local stores were out of celery salt. It was very strange and ultimately very frustrating as I just couldn't wait to light up the grill and chow down on some Chicago style hot dogs.<br /><br />Anyways if I couldn't buy it locally then I had to buy some on the net and of course I came to Amazon first. I immediately found Simply Organic Celery Salt. I had never heard of organic celery salt but considering I buy as many things organic as I can. I immediately ordered a pack. I received them 2 days later and was extremely happy to find out that they use sea salt instead of regular salt. So not only is it made with organic celery. they also use sea salt. which is much better for you than regular salt. So overall it was a good thing that my stores were out of celery salt as I would have never found this brand otherwise.<br /><br />Needless to say we pigged out on Chicago style hot dogs that night and they were the best Chicago styled hot dogs I had ever had. Not only do I have a new brand of hot dogs. I also have a new brand of celery salt. Bring on the hot dogs!!!<br /><br />5 stars!!
39333,B001XWNBWI,A6YT8ATZ4SEKT,C. Moran,0/0,1322697600,Good quality and fresh,A neighbor and I split the order. to much for one person but the price was right and the quality good.
39359,B000LKYXUC,AU2EKRTHJ7753,D. Miller Fun Shopper,2/2,1319328000,Great substitute,This is a wonderful substitute for SALT ! For all you SALT lovers. you should switch to this right away. It seasons your food wonderfullyu but has half the salt intake. Perfect ! And good price  too. Hard to find in stores.
39361,B000LKYXUC,AR5067J185IQN,M. Hansen,1/1,1314835200,By the Box,Vege-sal has been used in our home daily for decades.  We love it in/on everything from soup to popcorn to scrambled eggs.  I'm sorry to say that at this time I can't buy this product on Amazon because the 20 oz boxes are not available for Prime shipping.  Using it as often as we do. we don't want to waste money on bottles.
39366,B003WEDVXO,A25WF34KSQND2M,R. A. Gross mom of  4,2/2,1301270400,The best cupcake mix EVER!!,I've tried mixes from a lot of stores. including expensive ones from WIlliams-Sonoma (Sprinkles. etc.).  This is by far the best cupcake mix on the market.  I worried at first about having 5 mixes in our pantry. but it has worked out well.  We always have one in our pantry for last minute guests. bake sales. or other gotta have a cupcake occasion.  The cupcakes themselves are a deep chocolate flavor. not too sweet. and the peanut butter icing is yummy.  For the cupcakes. you need 2 eggs. milk and butter. and for the frosting mix. you need milk and butter.  Some of the other mixes I've tried. they just give you the frosting recipe. but in this box you have the actual frosting mix.  Each box makes 12 very nice sized cupcakes.  Enjoy!

39371,B003VKR0J0,AF9OYN557Z77I,alexis,5/5,1325808000,Helps with spitup but constipates..,I have to mix this formula with the regular Enfamil Infant and make my own custom blend.  If you use this formula on its own your baby will get majorly constipated. My poor baby screamed for a full day trying to poop.  After I started mixing the 2 formulas. we nolonger have that issue and spit up is greatly reduced.  Its so much better than adding rice cereal to thicken formula b/c this has no clumps and doesn't clog the nipples.  I mix up a pitcher of this formula b/c its hard to mix and foams up at first.
39376,B003VKR0J0,A3684V90H7YALL,M. Cannon,1/1,1333929600,Constipates,This stuff does greatly reduce spit-ups but I would rather be covered in spit-up all day than have my baby scream because he is constipated. He's a happy spitter and keeps enough down that he's doing fine so this stuff is going in the trash!
39378,B003VKR0J0,A2CR8NS14QMT6Q,beccastach bec,1/1,1303084800,It really works!,My baby spit up alot since day one.  After trying a couple different kinds of formula. even ones that are lactose & soy free. I landed on Enfamil AR.  It started working right away...we hardly even need a burp cloth now.  Every once in awhile. I try to go back to Similac just to see if my baby has grown out of his reflux.  Every time he starts spitting up again. so back to the AR I go.  The Up & Up Brand (Target) with Rice Starch works just as good and isn't as expensive.
39383,B003VKR0J0,A8THBPQQPEAPI,Trai Ng,0/0,1328400000,It's a miracle!,My lo started choking during feeds and choking. gagging and coughing after feeds started at 2 weeks old.  I was breast and formula feeding.  We got referred to a gi pediatrician who said it's reflux.  Told us to thicken his milk w/ cereal and try zantac.  Thickening didn't help cause i couldn't get the right consistency w/ the right nipple hole size...and so still choking.  Zantac made it worse. after 3 days. i gave up on it. eventhough i know we're suppse to give it 2 wks.  Then gi dr. told us to try prevacid as well as alimentum formula.  Both made tings really bad.  He was having violent choking after his feeds. and i could hear all the liquids in his body moving. and waking up hrs after feeds choking.  I gave up the prevacid after day 5 and got an upper gi study and found out all structures were normal.  I found online Enfamil AR which has added rice starch that expands after they drink it in their tummy to help w/ spitup.  Lo wasn't spitting up alot but it was choking and gagging him cause it would come up to his throat.  So i tried the formula...today is day 5 and lets say it's been a miracle!  He is not choking during drinking anymore and only had a handful of times he's choked in the last 5 days which aren't even bad chokes. but more like coughs.  Where he would  to choke about 1 to 8 times after each feedings before.  I had to be extremely careful not to move him after his feedings before or he would likely choke...now I can move him more and he will not choke.  It seems like his choking is replaced w/ either nothing or a bit of spitup or a throat clear or cough at times.  I'm not giving any meds now.  The only thing is the AR can cause constipation for some. so I'm mixing the formula w/ 15 % enfamil newborn.  I may try adding some prune juice to one bottle a day to soften his stool.  So far he can go but it's a little dry.  I like the AR vs adding rice cereal myself cause it goes in like regular milk but thickens in the stomach.  I use dr. brown's 2 nipples cause its a tiny bit thicker than the enfamil newborn milk but it's perfect cause when the milk is too thin my lo chokes on it.  He is 7 weeks now.  By the way it's very easy to mix w/ warm water...no clumps and no clogging the nipple.
39390,B004XG2GGI,A3EIOMC103PG7W,Honestly,1/1,1322784000,too much fat,tastes great. but too much fat like all the other dumbo brands.<br />suzie was much better than this - the flatbreads are so low fat.<br />why not make this also low fat?
39410,B000S15BMS,AAJ1IYOUIHWF,D. Sun,2/2,1243036800,Nice Spice,This is exactly as I wanted. It is an excellent spice. but 18oz is a huge amount and I bought 2 jugs. which was a mistake. Great to add a unique flavor to rice. soups. and other dishes.
39424,B001ELL86Y,A6072UKQ6Y46M,slp,4/4,1296777600,The Best DeCaf in K-cups,This is the best decaf I have tasted in K-cups. Perfect cup of coffee. you would have to read the package to know it was decaf. full rich flavor. no bitterness.
39442,B001ELL86Y,AJLDJUZABT2TD,miss-matched shoes,1/1,1329091200,Don't Buy this!,We buy a lot of K-cups for our Keurig. typically going through about 4-6 a day. We often buy various ones to satisfy different tastes.<br /><br />This is the only brand that we have purchased that has given us problems. Not only have the k-cups exploded. leaving grounds all over the machine both inside and out. but every single k-cup in the two 24-count packages has done this. At first. we thought we just received a bad batch in one of the two packages that was a part of the order. but when the k-cups in both of the packages did this for k-cup after k-cup (there wasn't a single one that did not explode and leave coffee ground in the coffee mug. machine. or outside of the machine). we knew it wasn't a fluke.<br /><br />Since there is no return on food...buyer beware.
39448,B001ELL86Y,A1P6Y1PWU9SP1L,C. Turner,1/1,1310601600,One of the Best decaf K-Cups around!!,I love to have a cup of coffee at night but I'm always leery of how caffeine might affect me.  Tully's Decaf House Blend is perfect!!  During the day I drink Newman's Own Organic Special Blend and in the evening I have a cup of Tully's.  While they don't taste exactly alike (Tully's is a little weaker. I'd say) it's still a great alternative.  It's so hard to find a good decaf and I'm thrilled that I finally found one!!  It's fairly strong and bold but not skunky or overpowering in it's flavor.  I highly recommend it!!
39462,B001ELL86Y,A15LCHB30J5F8P,Linda,0/0,1334188800,Tully's K-cups,I just bought Tully's from Bed and Bath Beyond and have not had any trouble with the cups. Brewing fine each time.
39480,B001ELL86Y,A7RL3ZKF24DAM,Trishicat Trish,0/0,1279497600,My favorite,Of the decaf K-cups I have tried. this is my new favorite and the only decaf I stock in my house.  It is strong. but smooth without any bite.  I serve it to my husband sometimes. who hates decaf. and he likes it.  Emeril's was good. but I believe this is better.  For some guests in my house. it may be too strong.  I just make 16 oz. with it in an oversized mug. then split it and it still tastes fine that way.
39483,B001ELL86Y,A1ZVM1VLWAP0KS,R2B,0/0,1274054400,A good decafe,I Enjoy it very much while my future wife thinks it is so-so. She felt it had a slight biter taste. I on the Other hand Thought it Tasted very Good.<br />I do Not think there is a bitter taste.<br />& Yes I will be buying this again.
39501,B00028P3CK,A2ZXT6MSWISDXT,E. Harnish,33/33,1225324800,Stevia Extract,I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound. it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again.<br />For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar.
39502,B00028P3CK,A26NEQFG6FIBXH,J. R. Wilt,26/26,1215388800,Excellant product - good price,Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.
39527,B00028P3CK,A1NA8VBHIFTDCN,Pam Leach,1/1,1349568000,BEWARE OF THIS MISLEADING PRODUCT!!,The very 1st thing I noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted! I've tried stevia by numerous manufacturers (PLUS. I read the excellent reviews!)  and this is hands-down the worst!<br /><br />When I finally read the actual ingredients (I had assumed it was stevia) and discovered that the very 1st ingredient wasn't stevia..but RICE MALTODENTRIN. I was shocked AND angry!  I have a liver disorder and cannot pump crap like maltodextrin into my liver!  Hence. the use of stevia. an all natural product.  BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />...It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index. similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia. You must consider the carbohydrate content of products sweetened with added maltodextrin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Read more:[...]

39545,B00028P3CK,A2BBFA2LS61V9I,R. Blowe,1/1,1236211200,NOW stevia extract,As a healthier alternative to other sweeteners I have tried. stevia extract fulfilled the billing it had received.  I had been led to this brand (NOW) because it reportedly had less bitter aftertaste than other brands and I found that to be true although there is still a slight undesirable aftertaste.  Stevia provides sweetness but a different tasting sweetness that takes some time to get used to.

I put it on chinese food. mexican food. macaroni & cheese. everything! I've used it as a dipping sauce for pork chops. chicken fingers. and corn dogs. If you're looking for something really tasty and with a kick (and you're bored of Tabasco. Texas Pete. and all those) then you should try some of this stuff.
39625,B004Q9QIPM,A14SOW889A4TAT,J. Tan,2/3,1333497600,okay but not tasty,Bought this because the price is cheap but have good review.<br /><br />Pros: To some degree. this brand is tender than most other brands. The meat seems fresh. Better than some brand which looks like having been sitting in the warehouse for centuries...<br /><br />Cons: The tasty is not fantastic. just so-so. The most I don't like is that it tastes kind of sour. If a brand is tasty. you will just keep eating piece by piece until you are full. But for this brand. I am not desired to eat more than three pieces because of the sour.<br /><br />If you prefer tender and don't care about the sour. you have try this.
39641,B009KAQZ9G,A20NB4UBW4WDKG,Gerardo GD,1/1,1293321600,Coffe shop quality capuccino at home,I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a supermarket brand. I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions. we brew milk first then the espresso. this makes it look very nice. especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety. with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute. you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes. it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested. but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time. this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.

39687,B005GIF5VU,AGF53TM0RAV1N,William J. Tidwell,1/2,1328400000,Cat's are fickel,My cat's are spoiled. I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there. but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World. especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love. until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away. he will stalk me. or sit in front of the TV. or lay on the keyboard. whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know. I'm whipped.  But be honest. if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them. mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon. different flavors of cat treats are different prices. even though they are all Temptations. Friskies. Party Mix. or whatever.
39716,B005GIF5VU,ASDXJIOGE96NA,J.T.,1/1,1326326400,Good product.,I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor. though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

They are both absolutely crazy about these treats (even the picky one)!.  All I have to do is take out the bag. even if they are in a different part of the house. they will hear it and come running.  I love giving them this treat because they enjoy it so much!

39763,B005GIF5VU,A2ZQ0DV7WQIT67,Patty,0/0,1340150400,Kitty Crack,All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work. he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him. the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no. because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway. they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

It's so much cheaper doing this than buying cat grass and it's more reliable and easy to grow.  My cats (and dogs sometimes) love to snack on it a little bit to aid in digestion.  It also looks VERY nice and I can see why people might grow it just for decoration.

39885,B000CMIZ0I,A2G2MR3ER065NK,dietzster,0/0,1341360000,I don't think this is decaf.,I purchased this because I have a sensitivity to caffeine and wanted a tea to drink at night.  This tea kept me up for hours in the night all three times I tried it.  Why try 3 times?  I had a caffeinated beverage in the morning on 2 occasions and wanted to see if I had the same results in my ability to sleep with or without the caffeine in the morning.  It made no difference to me.<br /><br />I can have minimal caffeine before 2 pm and sleep that night.<br /><br />The flavor is good and I like this tea.  I just will have to find a herbal tea for drinking at night.
39891,B000CMIZ0I,AE0NDNWY0UPCN,Lavendar Sunrise Lave,5/11,1234224000,Buyer Beware,Kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract.  While Yogi teas tea box does not make these claims. they also fail to tell buyers that their Kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast.  They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe. however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections.  They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process. but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections. I would highly recommend that you avoid this product.  They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection.

Easily digestible. senior formulas with joint help. great on their digestive system. just a great. great product! Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I will say though...if your dog is a gulper. please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew. They seem to like it so much that you really need to be on hand just in case. as is true with any chewy product for your furkids!

Switching to EVO. led to her losing her extra weight. so that she can now jump a foot or two. whereas previously. she could not jump.  Note that the analysis lists protein as 50%.  This is higher than many other high quality foods.  Our cat loves this food. but she does not eat too much of it (in an extended several day taste test. she rejected another high-quality food. and chose EVO).  Note: this company (Natura) has been purchased by Procter and Gamble.
39929,B00371V2V0,A1IZMROJI3WDY6,Amazon Reader,1/1,1342137600,A great healthy food- my cats love it,I stopped buying grocery store cat food after several experiences that happened nearly simultaneously: I learned what is contained in them (what is actually in fish meal. for example).  I learned about other additives- that are not food- and how they effect an animals organs.  I learned about the recall of foods from China killing pets nationwide. if not worldwide.  I learned about the national recall lists of pet foods and all kinds of foods and products published online everyday of the week.  So I made the switch to organics with ingredients labels that will make you smile instead of shutter.  These foods are more expensive. but you love your pets so you'll be buying peace of mind and their continued health.

Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row. and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness. just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it. as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more. fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price. this stuff should be standard in every home. along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.

I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy. in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2. but one bottle was broken. Yep. you guessed it. Amazon sent me a new pack of two. and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time. but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle. your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?

It is great on pretty much everything. as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos. lettuce. onions. and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef.

39976,B001TZJ3OE,A3908E1G8IL52G,Jessica Ztardust,1/2,1312243200,Highly Addicting!,I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store. and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater. and a vegetarian at that. so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet. and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand. which I didn't like much at all (thick. not as flavorful. way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons. and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber. too! The only thing I have a hard time with. and this is just a personal issue. is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great. but they have a very thin. clear skin that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all. just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still. I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first. and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you. know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how. just buy it. You'll fall in love!

Given the chunky consistency and the fact that it has the word colon in the name is pretty much a turn off. It appears to be more the result of a colon cleansing if you ask me. In any case it has an odd and slightly bitter taste. I think it's the mustard they put in it. Yuck...
40038,B0000DG4MO,A2BMLTODXV79NB,Ariana Farris,4/4,1084492800,Best darn hot sauce EVER!,I LOVE this hot sauce. I never used to like spicy food and then I tried this. I nearly burned my tounge off but it tasted sooooo good. So after the initial pain. you'll love it. It is perfect for the people who are bored with regular hot sauces. Nothin compares to this fabulous hot sauce. I put it on everything. It'll add spice and flavor to any dish or put it directly on food. I'm not sure that it is reccomended to put it directly on food. but I do it and love it. If you think you've tried every hot sauce and think you can handle the heat. then you should try Dave's to proove yourself wrong! I love Dave's Insanity Sauce!!!!

They worked wonderfully on the first go around.  I was originally put off by this type of trap because of the extra things you need to set them (wire to tie the two traps together. and marker flags to pin them down so a half dead gopher can't run off with your trap). but with a little creativity used a wire hanger bent to accomplish what I needed without extra purchasing.  Cheaper. and for me. very effective.

40217,B0030GOO5S,A33D5ZOW08WI56,frogma,1/1,1326240000,positive reviews are repeats,The only reason this stuff has even three stars is the repeatedly posted. almost exactly the same reviews. obviously posted over and over to raise the rating.  I just got a Keurig and am shocked I had not heard what a rip off the hot chocolate is.  It really ticked me off to spend $11 on something I could have bought for $2 and enjoyed much more.  True. Keurig is made for convenience. but really how much more convenient is it to add water and a kcup than to rip open a pack of cocoa and heat water in the microwave.  Totally agree. chocolate water. if you can even call it that.  Please don't waste your money like I did.
40222,B0030GOO5S,A1W2VEZ7GK5SYY,robgeisler DoubleKup,5/7,1261958400,Best single cup Hot Chocolate I've tasted!,Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate hot cocoa is much better than the Dark Cocoa and far exceeds the other brands.  If you find it in stock. buy as much as you can.  This stuff is like gold. it only increases in value... after you taste the others!
40225,B0030GOO5S,A17PG52CVZ5FIJ,Radical Ed,0/0,1327190400,Absolutely Dreadful,I got a box of the Cafe Escapes Hot Chocolate with my Keurig last Christmas. I had no idea the machine made anything but coffee. so it was a welcome surprise. My girlfriend doesn't drink coffee but she loves hot cocoa. so I thought she would be tickled to have a cup of cocoa in three minutes flat.<br />I brewed her a cup after running the Keurig through the rinse cycle and made her a cup of cocoa in a small mug on the second-to-lowest size setting (we have a B-79). Immediately she grimaced at the taste and objected to drinking another sip. She told me it tasted weak. tasted like it contained a fake sugar-substitute and had a horrible after-taste. Reluctantly I dumped it. just thinking she was being picky. as she sometimes is.<br />A few days later I was still warming-up on a cold morning and didn't want another cup of coffee. so I figured I had 15 cocoa K-Cups left. so why not try one?<br />Not only was her description completely accurate. but she left out the fact it was so bad it would ruin the rest of my morning. It was dreadful in every aspect and although I really hate to waste anything. I had to dump it too. It was completely undrinkable and I'm typing this with the worst taste fermenting in my mouth. Ugh. my tongue is coated with artificial. filmy gross-ness and I have a feeling drinking the melted wax from a chocolate-scented dollar-store candle would've tasted better. This is absolutely the worst hot chocolate mix I've ever had the displeasure to attempt to drink. I have 14 cups left and I just might toss them all. I wouldn't give this to a prisoner. Awful. I wish there were negative stars.
40254,B000F74248,A3S3WM1O6LQXPG,JJ Waahkah,0/0,1307318400,Cats Didn't Like it,I bought Innova wet when I had 1 kitten in the house and he shunned it. I bought a second can when kitten 2 arrived and she backed away from it! I had one extra can in which I added some water to soup it up. and neither kitty ate it. After my unscientific tests. I can't recommend this formula for my cats. Maybe yours will like it more.
40260,B00086ICFG,A289P91M6MHUTP,Ann,0/1,1265414400,Sanding Sugar,This was less sugar than I was expecting. 4 oz is barely enough for rolling one batch of cookies.

Evelyn Hurrell,1/1,1256342400,assam. heavenly,i usually purchase my loose tea in england from fortnam and mason's and bring back enough to last a year. but. unfortunately was not able to make the trip this year.  this tea is wonderful. full flavored and very mellow.  i would recommend it most highly.  cheers. evelyn hurrell.
40278,B005DQGIA2,A25IR5X44B5MSN,Stephanie Frost,15/15,1300924800,Best Cereal On The Shelves (When You Can Find It...),I won't go into detail on how amazing this cereal is. because I feel the above comments say enough.<br /><br />What I will enlighten the lovers of this cereal about is its current availability.

40280,B005DQGIA2,A1QLNEKFPVTS4N,Electro Bond Refinishing Tub boss,3/3,1274572800,yummy,I am sad that this product is being discontinued in the stores but I am glad that I was able to find it at your site.  Thank you for fast shipping.  One box was slightly damaged but the inner bag was intact so no problem there.  Thanks again.
40283,B005DQGIA2,A165TZRUAPMPAU,C. Garrett,1/1,1320105600,Heaven in a Box ;-),I was so sad when they stopped producing this cereal year-round. My whole family LOVES it! I was so happy to find it on Amazon. It arrived yesterday (in perfect condition) and already one box is almost gone! I realize it's not exactly nutritional fare. but as a dessert. it's the BEST!
40284,B005DQGIA2,A1YIUQ1PMZLQRW,Jennifer,1/1,1315872000,MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM,Just like I remembered them. Oh so good. I might even buy a few more for my children!  Thank You.
40298,B005DQGIA2,A30V1O6FSX1V28,Chuck,0/0,1316131200,WOW!,Hands down the best cereal!! I ate this growing up as a kid then never saw it until now. I wish it was around all year but glad I got some now!
40305,B005Q1812W,AMZRY5WD5EAUW,Axxul,1/1,1326931200,Yummy!  (does not contain actual cheese or dairy),We received a bag of these yesterday in a snack gift box sent by my sis in law.<br />I tasted them and they are quite good!  I looked at the ingredients and realized there isn't any actual cheese in them so I figured the nutritional yeast had something to do with the flavor.  I confirmed this after googling nutritional yeast and also found that it has a good amount of nutritional value. I loved the fact that the kale chips contain 4 grams of protein per ounce!  I'm always trying to find other ways to get protein into my kids since they're allergic to animal milk and I have to bribe them to eat meat!<br />Although these are quite good I'm such a cheapskate that I will probably not be paying that much for this item specially when you can easily find the recipe for cheesy kale online ;)  but then again I'm not much of a kitchen person so I might buy it once in a while if I can find it at a local store.<br />My only question regarding this product is...can nutritional yeast worsen candida?  my 4 yr. old is under candida treatment and after reading random blogs. articles. etc. I still can't figure out if it's an issue for a person with candida. I could not find an actual article backed up by research so if any of you have any information on this subject I would appreciate it if you would comment.
40351,B002LDDTBQ,ARYAUWZRC74N7,artist barb artist barb,0/0,1276560000,OrgraN multigrain O'S,This cereal is high in protein and fiber and uses nutritious whole grains.  The problem is that it has a flat flavor to it.  Adding fruit and sprinkling cinnamon on it make it more palatable.  I probably will not buy this again as there are more flavorful cereals out there that are gluten free and also have whole grains.
40396,B001ELL3DM,A3LJT6EVGKD1EP,Cheryl,0/0,1349654400,Yes to Smart Bran,I Love it ! It's low calorie .  it's organic! Doctors recommend 25- 30 grams fiber daily. and Smart Bran has 13 grams per serving. Some fruits and veggies and your set for the day. I eat it dry over Vanilla frozen yogurt with cinnamon. Awesom.
40414,B001ELL3DM,A12SGPR2HKI64H,ladoctora,1/2,1325894400,Good alternative to Fiber One,I recently have eliminated Splenda from my diet because I am concerned about its effects.  Fiber One is sweetened with Splenda. unfortunately. as are so many other products these days.  But I was concerned about how to replace its high fiber content. which really is important to me.  So I decided to try this product.  It is terrific!  A lighter texture than Fiber One. almost identical fiber content.  It has 30 calories more per serving. but you get a bigger serving (2/3 cup versus 1/2 cup) and I will take the extra calories for a natural sweetness rather than the Splenda.  Also. this is a great product to get on Subscribe & Save!
40418,B0044MF2YE,A3TTJ4BLEUPWP8,fidled,0/0,1350259200,Sorry,I was disappointed that it was not half as good as Lawry's Meatloaf Mix.  It was too<br />much doughy consistance.  Will not order again..
40431,B003GMDABA,A2FJJ7C2WYIKNC,Kathryn L Shore,0/0,1350432000,Great low-carb bagels,I've tried several other brands of low-carb breads and they were flavorless with an odd texture.  Carb Krunchers breads  are great - they freeze well and hold up well in the freezer (don't become soggy when they thaw).  They toast very well.  You could serve these to unsuspecting people and they wouldn't know the difference.  Not the BEST bagel I've ever had. but a really GOOD low-carb bagel.
40433,B0048BA2B4,A3G15LM09I3RG,MAZ NYC,2/7,1325289600,Fraud,The title of this item led me to believe it is goose foie gras--it is not.  When it arrived. I discovered it's duck!  And overpriced at that.  And I discovered it can't be returned.  Boo!  Hiss.  Bait and switch.
40445,B003Y3F5EQ,A112L70RTD50OX,columbiauni,2/2,1290729600,My kid loves this stuff!,Who knew that my 1 year old would love broccoli this much???<br />I'm thrilled that he likes this puree of broccoli. zucchini. peas. and couscous. It's a chunkier style than many other purees. so it's definitely something to try once your baby does well with the stage 2 foods. It doesn't have the big chunks like the chicken & stars meal or the carrot & corn one. but it's got a bumpy texture because of the broccoli and the couscous. so your baby needs to be OK with that thicker texture.<br />This particular blend is difficult to find. so we buy in bulk whenever it's available.
40450,B003Y3F5EQ,A261I99RHT7ONU,Isaacsmom,0/0,1349481600,Great organic nutrition! My son loves it.,My son loves this product it is his second favorite meal. He always gobbles it right up. Great value too since it is organic.

40478,B00020HHRW,AKNHKB593FINL,Anastasia Morgan,0/0,1339027200,Tastes ok. good for ya!,This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store. so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular). I figured. why not--I drink tea. so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.
40487,B00020HHRW,A1YJNI5NUYVJKG,RLH,0/0,1333929600,Love this tea,Better than many I have tried.  With a little honey this is a terrific cup of tea.  Going to order more.  Nice and smooth.

40505,B00020HHRW,A2YNIKQDLZR2WW,Laura Steenhagen Laura,0/0,1315353600,Great tea for pregnancy,I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
40509,B00020HHRW,A1WZY9GOEE7IAZ,alidep,0/0,1309219200,Very Good!,The tea taste is very good. I've taken it yesterday for the first time. I'm taking it because of my pregnancy. many friends told me about its precious toning for the uterus.
40516,B00020HHRW,A1QRA8XPFUEKW5,Veronika138,1/2,1325548800,Great for your health,Arrived on time.  What a deal !!! So glad I could find this product on amazon !  I used this when i feel like im getting sick<br />Thanks !
40517,B00020HHRW,A3V9M50SZJ2A2D,LadyFingers,1/2,1319328000,Served its purpose,I do not really like tea but I needed to drink it for medical reasons.  Shipping was really fast and the price was good.  I am sure those who like Sage Tea would love it.
40519,B00020HHRW,A2EMM13TIU7IML,I. Santos,1/2,1298592000,Not even close...,This was a waste of money. the item was late. package was torn up.and the tea was terrible. not a good product in my opinion and bad handling.
40530,B00020HHRW,AMN376J6RZWP0,Dorothy Gale JusMe,0/1,1332115200,Personal preference,I had hoped this tea would taste better but it just tastes to me like I steeped weeds from the backyard.
40547,B00020HHRW,A1ODU9IV6O87IB,redmondbelle,4/22,1126569600,Don't pay for expedited delivery,I paid over $13.00 for expedited delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again.
40549,B00020HHRW,A20X23WJLV4R5X,kittykatbookworm,18/18,1251849600,tasty Maybe beneficial,My midwife recommended this product. and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow. but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate. it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.
40578,B00020HHRW,AFDNACPVKXXPZ,Nicole M. Rios,3/3,1255219200,Good Inexpensive Cleanser.,This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in. but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great. but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle. tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.
40597,B00020HHRW,A34E1744VPQCNU,Dbp323,1/1,1337299200,Dbp323,Recommend it to all.  Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker.  I loved it during a URI. upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous.  Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing.  I now brew it for cold tea as well.  Very refresshing.
40607,B00020HHRW,A35QCK3X0S0QQW,John R. Waldren,1/1,1325635200,Senna Leaf tea,A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good. and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out. you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in. and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.
40640,B000HYI2AO,AHD3TDQM401E2,C. J. Johnson,4/5,1183075200,The snack that's good for you.,Like the commercial says: If it comes from Welchs. it must be good for you.  These fruit snacks are delicious.  The serving size is just enough to take the edge off of hunger.  In addition. the package itself is small enough to fit in your pocket.  I just wish they wouldn't put so many concord grape flavors in.
40650,B000HYI2AO,ATL2SAIQRE144,Helen M. Broome,2/11,1264982400,WELCHS FRUIT SNACKS,I ENJOYED THIS PRODUCT BUT WISH I HAD PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE NUTRITIONAL INFORMATIN.  EACH PACKET IS 4 POINTS ON THE WEIGHT WATCHERS PLAN.
40651,B004ECMDXW,A2RP1OAEVB8Z4E,Rae Chel,2/2,1320364800,Easy and Yummy Snack,I first bought these to have on hand in case of an emergency. It is a plain and simple fish perfect for adding to a simple soup or salad. I personally like having the low sodium so I can add the amount of sea salt I like. but saying that I don't enjoy the fish on their own without a little salt added.
40698,B00517518I,ADY8U20P8D7XS,Paul K. Rickli,1/1,1331164800,Stale Popcorn,The popcorn was stale and tasted like plastic.  The expiration date was 5 months old.  You can't return it so I have to throw it all away.  Very disappointing!  Do not buy this popcorn.
40699,B000KAYPCE,A2DRM50SRH90GG,Jacqueline Betts Mom of 10,0/0,1277424000,Fantastic Wholesome Treat,I LOVE this product!!! Our dog and cats are crazy about it and it is good for them.  NO additives!!! Only dehydrated beef livers!  You do have to be careful because too many will cause diarrhea but I cut them small (when necessary) for my 8 lb Papillon and he can have quite a few before having any problem.  It does smell like liver so you won't want to carry them in your pocket without putting them in a plastic baggy.  Excellent for training!!!
40707,B0013LVMKW,AQDNN0O86WXGC,GFA,0/0,1332892800,Winner,I love these bars!  I really can't believe that they are gluten free.  I truely would not be successful without having all of the Bakery On Main products that are available to me.  Some gluten free items just don't taste good. but B.O.M. has gotten their recipes right.  Sign up with them online.  They are great at sending you meal ideas and coupons.
40715,B0013LVMKW,A3MN7CFA5N3XWT,Trina,0/0,1332806400,Very yummy,I love the Bakery on Main Cranberry Maple Nut granola. so I picked up the granola bars to try. I still love the granola the best. but these are good to take and go with you. especially when traveling. I love the combination of flavors. One of the few gluten free granola bars that do not taste like cardboard.
40755,B000LKYYBU,A2RRTPFGA1GKK8,tcbird,0/0,1319155200,I Love Ginger,This is a great product for something different to use as a snack.  Ginger is a good supplement for the digestion system.
40768,B001E5DXCM,A1MEC2QLXNS14H,Amanda,0/1,1237593600,yum,I'm a coffee person by nature. but since my mom came back from a trip to India with a taste for chai. I got hooked. I bought this to get free shipping on something else. and was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. I have to admit that in recent months I've become a fan of flavored creamers and stuff. so the fact that there's non-dairy creamer in this doesn't bother me. but it might bother a purist.All in all. if you just have it as a treat. the 140 calories per serving won't be a problem.
40779,B00401T290,A1Z8ENYSB5AU74,Christianne,0/0,1344643200,Cats love Purina Naturals and it is GREAT for sensitive tummies!,Cats really love this food and I recommend it to anyone I know with a cat who throws up a lot. Many times they will stop throwing up altogether after being put on this food. It is great for sensitive tummies. I like the fact that this comes in multiple smaller pouches so that it stays extra fresh and is easier to handle. I have back and joint problems and I just can't handle large bags of food so I am willing to pay extra for the convenience. Plus. I like knowing my kitties have fresh food. My cat is allergic to many of the ingredients in the super premium and holistic food brands and none of my cats will eat any of the dark colored cat foods like those anyway. I knew from the color of this food that it would be a hit with them. I realize this has corn in it but I do not see any difference in that and the more expensive brands that use potatoes. blueberries. tomatoes. cranberries. etc. Cats aren't meant to eat that either. Anyway. I have been very happy with this food and so have my cats. And my vet says it is perfectly fine to feed to them so we are all happy!
40786,B000EM6POE,A1R377IPZOKLMM,Gina B It's a dry heat!,2/2,1264896000,Tried a lot of cinnamon apple teas; this one is best,I'm glad Amazon got these back in stock; they were out for awhile and I have been unable to find it at local grocery stores.  I've tried a LOT of the different cinnamon apple teas out there. and for some reason I like this one best.  Not too strong tasting; and no weird chemical apple tastes either like a Tazo tea I tried.  I am not a big tea drinker. but this one is mild & good for unwinding at night.
40793,B000H25WIG,A2R8FSST5DMNUS,Sharon Business Lady,0/0,1333929600,Best Rice Ever,Tilda basmati and wild rice is a delicious combination and cooks perfectly every time.  Very high quality rice. never sticky or mushy.  I hope they are not taking it off the market. as I can't find it in local groceries any more and have been buying it for years.
40794,B00507CPE2,A39W6FFODE83ZH,P. Luna,2/2,1309737600,Price?,These Granola Thins are tasty.  They remind me of graham crackers with chocolate on top.  Would someone from Amazon please fix the price though?  I'd like to purchase this product. but not at $1.739.00 for two boxes.  Really?
40816,B001IZEJ76,AYPB41TW9A6V8,Bette Guadalupe tickles1244,1/1,1292544000,Link up to the Combo Pack,The taste is beefy and the smooth cheese is so delicious. should have gotten another box they are just that good.
40822,B003ZIEZGO,A2MUGFV2TDQ47K,Lynrie Oh HELL no,0/0,1324684800,100% American Juice From Concentrate!,The product I received is good Florida Orange Juice from concentrate NOT as described here. When chilled it tastes as well as the refrigerated dairy case version. At the right price it's worth a try!
40835,B0053HNTUS,A39MFXHRSBP3FC,Dimoe,0/0,1339632000,Excellent Product,I decided to try this out based on other reviews and I was lookinng for a healthier oil.  The flavor this oil provides. along with Flavocol butter salt. is great.  I have had my popcorn maker for three years and popped over 100 pounds of popcorn and this is the best oil I have ever used.  After using half of my one gallons I am happy to recommend this product as a great oil for tasty. movie theater tasting oil.  It is very thin so you have to be careful pouring it unlike coconut oil or ActII which are usually thick. Happy popping!!
40838,B00112GBO0,A32R1JBRI56ZJA,D. Payne ardent book lover,12/13,1206057600,Great black tea!,This tea comes in vacuumed sealed foil pouches inside 6 cardboard boxes. On cutting open the sealed pouch. you are treated to the fresh scent of pure black tea. I like that there are six small pouches rather than one big one. so that I know the tea won't go stale before I can use it all.<br /><br />The leaves are definitely the highly prized top buds. and is single-source as the package info states (not blended with cheaper teas from other countries). You cannot over-brew this tea. It doesn't become bitter or acidic if you accidentally leave it brewing too long.<br /><br />So far. I've only had it hot but can tell it will also make a great iced tea.
40840,B00112GBO0,A3GDQ5WLKCSGUC,Peter G. Watchorn,11/15,1202774400,The best tea on the market,For years tea lovers in the USA have had to resort to importing Dilmah. probably the finest in the world (it revolutionised the domestic tea market in Australia when it was introduced there twenty years ago). Beautifully fresh (vacuum packed). finest leaf. richly satisfying. fairly traded. among tea connoisseurs Dilmah is more an institution than a regular tea company. By purchasing their products. you will not only be indulging in the ultimate tea-drinker's experience. you'll also be helping a multitude of award-winning non-profit programmes instituted by Dilmah's enlightened management. There should be more products like this. Do yourself a favour and buy some today.
40844,B00112GBO0,A2SVHUDEISU1B9,B. paulson,1/1,1264291200,clarifying the differences of opinions here,First off. the tea i received was also very fine cut tea. of average quality. In my opinion the red canned Dilmah Supreme is better than this.<br /><br />I might be able to explain why there are different opinions regarding this product. I have bought dilmah tea for many years at a local Mediterranean store. about three years ago they sold the identical green box with the same fine cut leaves in a vacuum packed bag. then the product changed to a better quality course leaf tea. but the box was nearly identical except for a cellophane pane to show the tea leaves and cellophane bag. then dilmah seemed to stop distributing their Ceylon tea. and only marketed their flavor teas of all things. so i turned to amazon for tea.<br /><br />so its possible they are distributing both forms at different times. since it seems they are a bit schizophrenic about their marketing.<br /><br />for the record i bought mine in Dec 2009.

40879,B001M0A8L8,A169KHGQC542G,THE BEAR,0/0,1349481600,The Taste Test,As always Amazon packed all the candy with plenty of bubble pack. bags arrived in perfect condition. But I read reviews on other Halloween products that the bars were melted. white or crushed so I took it upon myself to open the bags and test the candy. Well after quite some time testing I found the candy bars prefect and delicious.<br />Now I have to order more.
40915,B0043H3922,A1E4X1T1W6Z82T,Oksana Maksimuk,1/1,1285372800,5 Prism Gum,I'll start off by saying that this gum has a very good flavor. The electric watermelon also mixes in with some sort of banana flavor making a perfect combo. Its a great addition to the 5 collection and would recommend this gum to anybody here who enjoys the 5 gum series. My only negative sight on this item would probably be the lasting time. Flavor only lasts about 10 min. or so then begins to fade.<br /><br />ALSO: Item has only 10 pack not 12. so I had to ask for a refund of $5.00. Be Careful!

Now it's been turned into a must-have on hand product when I bake. I've used it for baking cakes and frostings. Has an excellent flavor. Will make you ever wonder why we have been subjected to grocery store baking products.

40988,B001T5GHUM,A2E32ESPZ7R1W5,ackpacket,39/40,1300406400,Good but overpriced,This matcha tastes a little bitter because it's not the highest quality. but it's awsome for MANY things.  If you mix up a large batch in cold water and let sit in the fridge overnight. you'll have cold brew matcha with little or NO bitterness.  Very smooth flavor when brewed that way.  I make about a gallon at a time and when I pour some I add a splash of milk that gives it some substance and really enhances the other flavors.  Also it works great for making any type of green tea dessert.<br /><br />however...<br /><br />THIS SELLS FOR $5.00 IN THE STORE.<br /><br />Do not pay 15+6shipping = $21!!!<br /><br />Hell if you contact me i'd pick some up and send it to you for like 12 bucks.

It's like eating chocolates: They are so rich in lime flavor you can only eat 2 or 3 at a time. The bite size morsels are perfect. lots of flavor and great cookie tastes blended together well. We will be buying more.

The only ingredient is Darjeeling second flush black tea leaves. and it is a truly complex and tasty tea. It tastes wonderfully black and needs nothing at all to be added for a great tea experience. This tea contains caffeine. and is a strong. distinctive. high-quality and refreshing tea.<br /><br />Recommended...a true step up for Stash!<br />*****

This is not the stick to your ribs bean soup Grandma made in the winter. You really MUST take the previously mentioned suggestions and add more goodies to it to make it HEARTY. You need 2 hours after the water has boiled until it's ready to eat...NOT a quick after-work meal. However. with the 50% off sale price AND free super saver shipping it's a deal at about 20 bucks plus or minus!<br /><br />I can't find the Expiration/Sell by date. After having interesting pets/pests arrive with a couple AMAZON fulfilled purchases. I'm not comfortable they're watching the dates themselves. There's no way to know UNTIL the items arrive. but customer service will do their best to address any problems or concerns.

LOL I always throw some cheddar into the bowl when I serve myself- love it that way! I would throw in some ham too. but haven't had any when I have made it. I have also thrown in a can of corn. which tasted great! This winter I plan to put this in a crock pot with ham. corn. and maybe some other items and just watch the snow come down. HMMMM.
41050,B0044QWDRO,AZV26LP92E6WU,M. Hammond ColemanFlGuy,0/0,1344038400,really good,really good in so many recipes. the product is fresh and it tastes delicious. it arrived in good condition. the price is good and it is delivered right to my front door. i am very happy with this purchase. there are many wonderful meals to include diced tomatoes.
41054,B004DF0A26,A1RT84N8JYTUT7,Katina Henderson Riverwitch,0/0,1339804800,Wish they had done better,I bought these because I have one dog that is allergic to corn. and all the other pill pockets have corn. while these don't.  I have used this product in the past. with good results. and this company was selling them at a good price. so I thought I'd try them.  It took almost three weeks for them to ship. and they only did so after I finally asked when they would be shipping.  I finally got the pill pockets. and it turned out that they sent me the wrong ones. which have corn in them. I contacted the company. and they sent me a return label (which only took 2 days) and told me they'd put the money back on my credit card. It's been a week and a half since I sent the product back to them. and I'm still waiting for my money.  I will not buy anything from them again.
41055,B004DF0A26,A2XIEF4NEJXTCN,Jessica W,0/0,1311465600,Cat Pill Pockets better value for dogs,My dog has many allergy sensitivities. and receives several medications per day for them.  For years he has been able to pick the pill out of anything I tried to hide it in... peanut butter. cheese. etc. I finally had the best success with gently force-feeding his pills down his throat.<br />These are the first pill tool that works! He waits anxiously for his 'treats' now. and catches them in his mouth. The pills never come back out unless he misses the catch and they occasionally bounce out on the floor.<br />I started buying the feline Pill Pockets for my dog. because his pills aren't very big. but he receives several per day. so the feline version is a better economy... 40 per bag instead of 25 dog pockets for the same price. The difference? They cat version is smaller than the dog version... but I'm not giving him horse pills. so they still work! I can easily squeeze a Benadryl & Prednisone in one pocket.  I put out enough money on vet appointments & medications for my little allergy boy... it's nice to find a few ways to save a few pennies while making his meds easier to administer.
41058,B000M36L9E,A1KTMOJ5FXYTB7,Alayne E. Heishman Alayne,10/13,1181606400,works like a charm,Upset stomach reach for good ole cola syrup rather than the pills or pink stuff.
41063,B000M36L9E,ARCMXE412SNSZ,Paulacola,0/0,1317081600,Cola lover,Good product. Ideal if you want to make your cola a little stronger tasting for a quicker picker upper. A little pricey but good.
41075,B0033GE6GW,A2GEZJHBV92EVR,History buff,0/0,1344384000,The best cheerios!,These are really good. Never ate cheerios until these came out. Now I have them in the house all the time. I eat them about2-3 times a week. Cheerios have recently come out with a peanut butter flavor. I like to mix the 2 flavors. OH SO.GOOD!!!!!!!!! Yummie in my tummy! Love them.

41083,B000LSZ2UY,A28GRFVAA4DU5P,A Texas reviewer,1/1,1190592000,Cherry with a hint of sour.,These candies are very good. They have a nice cherry flavor with just a little bit of sour thrown in. Most sour candies made these days make your eyes water and your mouth pucker. Not these gummi's. they have just enough of a sour taste to make them interesting but the sour taste is very very mild.<br /><br />My order came in great condition and very fresh.
41085,B002GWMDBE,AP7M7YQ37YFLY,Todd,0/0,1343174400,Very nice,We have spent a lot of time and money trying online coffee sellers.  This is our favorite after 12 years of searching.  Nice flavor and strong but not bitter.  Love it.
41091,B002Q2VK2W,A3Q3FT2J9P3FGK,Ben M. Wood,2/33,1324512000,Produces through torture,You might want to check youtube to see how foie gras is obtained before you buy it.  It is obtained through torture. The ducks and geese are violently force fed an incredible amount of food until their liver becomes diseased. engorged and fatty.  This is extremely painful and cruel.
41097,B001SJR5EQ,A2XD9U5BGZDN20,Flapsaddle,0/0,1321401600,Simply Delicious,This coffee. which I have been grinding fresh by the can for two years. is a genuinely full-flavored. but not jittery. almost smokey. you-can taste-the-roast flavor.
41123,B006IMBVJI,A8MEDPIQ2BUAN,S. Harris,0/0,1347408000,yummy,I like this flavor -much cheaper here than what I pay for it at work.  I really like the convenience of having it by the case
41125,B006IMBVJI,A2LJQJS6SEJOTW,BrentyBoy,0/0,1344038400,Good product.  High price,They are only two dollars a pop at speedway and the dollar store.  How is buying a case online more expensive?
41133,B000E65OJM,A2R6RA8FRBS608,Matthew G. Sherwin,11/11,1201219200,all right by me !!!,This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great cherry taste to it that is not overpowering with just a hint of berry flavor thrown in for good measure. Let it steep about three minutes and you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients; and there are no artificial ingredients. The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free. which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a cherry flavored tea with a slight berry twist to it. I highly recommend this tea! Enjoy!
41139,B000E65OJM,A250GBIWE6UJIU,Martha Miller dabbler in many things,1/1,1170806400,Excellent flavor!,This tea is one of my favorites.  The flavor is very cherry. and the longer you brew it the better it tastes.  I prefer it unsweetened. and even without sugar it has turned me from my Shasta Diet Black Cherry soda addition.<br />We recently got one of those instant hot water dispensers installed in our kitchen. which has reawakened my love of tea.  This is definitely one to be tried and will be a good addition to anyone's tea choices.<br />This is still one of my favorite teas.  One of my favorite desserts is a pot of this tea to sip while nibbling on a couple pieces of dark dark chocolate.  Tastes like eating a chocolate covered cherry...yummmmm
41147,B000E65OJM,A347Z4F4XERH30,tea lover tl,0/0,1235952000,Not the best tea from Celestial,This is bland.  Not one of the best teas from Celestial.  Try Red Zinger or Apple Cinnamon Spice instead.
41164,B002M5GM7Q,AFRVEL3CQLE7P,MartFmCerritos resident nerd,0/0,1300838400,For Chocolate Lovers,This one is for Chocolate Lovers only. if you're familiar with the movie concession standard. Raisinettes. then you'll know what the 'normal' chocolate covered raisin looks like. Well. these do not fit that profile. There is so much chocolate covering the raisin that there are no discernible wrinkles to be seen. This is on top of the fact that they were double the size of what I normally view a chocolate covered raisin. Truth be told. when I first looked at the bag. I thought I had received chocolate covered peanuts or something. The label readily allayed that fear.<br />Nonetheless. I was still skeptical and had thoughts of giant raisins inside a thick coating of chocolate. Well. the raisins seem to of normal stature after comparing one sans chocolate. But the chocolate coating was definitely thick. Therefore. if you like chocolate with a little raisin mixed in. you'll love this Koppers product (that's me). If you would prefer a little chocolate with your raisin. maybe the Sunmaid brand would be more suitable.<br />I purchased the Sunmaid product and liked it as well. Packaging is a little nicer compared to Koppers' plastic bag. However. it does make a lot of noise during shipping. It was on sale at Amazon for $16.95 (51oz) and made comparable to this 5lb bag at $26.75. At Sunmaid's regular price of $21.26. Koppers is a much better deal.
41198,B000SATUWG,A2BPDEZMIDP8SL,unhappy,0/0,1336262400,Very much like Callard & B,Ive hunted high and low and have tried every type of licorice toffee that I can find since C&B stopped making licorice toffee. Spot on in flavor.  I've read other reviews that outfields or other brands are better.  They are very salty.  If you're a super salty licorice fan. then this is probably not for you. Just the right amount of salt. right amount of sweet.  I've never once written a food review on amazon but I'm doing ths in hopes that this licorice toffee doesn't end up like C&B did and getting discontinued. Keep it coming!  It does come in a large bag. 4 plus pounds. but well worth it.  I've paid 9 to 12 dollars for less than half a pound for stuff that I haven't liked. and occasionally I've seen individual toffees at a gas station from time to time that I've paid 69 cents a piece for. There's got to be at least a hundred plus pieces here.... Plenty to share but I'm ashamed to admit that I've eaten most of the bag myself. but not ashamed to say that I just ordered bag 2.....  Great stuff!
41204,B000SATUWG,AGGDI4VWPPZ6J,L. Miller,0/0,1323302400,I wish I didn't like this so much,This is good if you like soft licorice and caramel. Not so good if you're not supposed to eat licorice (like if you have high blood pressure) or sugar.  It's wicked.  I'm bagging it and putting it in stockings as 'coal.'  If I can keep from eating it all before Christmas. that is.
41213,B000SATUWG,A71Z81T2D96P3,Dave Delgado 11thAve,1/2,1288224000,More caramel than licorice,I like Gustaf's other licorice. the ones I've posted a review on before.  But these. they are way more caramel-y than they are licorice-y.  You know the caramels (Brach's?) that you can buy in a bag and melt after you've unwrapped each piece to make caramel apples?  These are like those.  They have a grainy. very sugary texture.  Although the licorice flavor is okay. it's clear that this licorice is just caramel in disguise.  They seem way more geared to the American palate than to the European taste. (there's no zout to these at all.) These Gustaf's licorice caramels are a poor substitute for European caramel (toffee).  I won't be buying these again.<br /><br />For a better choice or replacement for the famed Callard & Browser licorice that you might remember. try Walker's NonSuch toffee.  It's awesome. and I wish Amazon currently had it available.  Once you try Walker's licorice toffee. nothing else will do.
41216,B003GYVIO4,A27S8QTYEQGAZX,Samantha Daniel,0/0,1326499200,as pictured,We are using these treats for a retreat weekend for teenagers. so I was glad to find the 3-packs. which allow space to label with an uplifting message.

Carr,2/3,1301184000,A good low protein food!,I was surprised to find that the canned Halo cat food is low in protein - even lower than Science Diet wet KD for cats.  And my cat refuses to eat the Science Diet food anyway.  She loves this (turkey) and also the chicken and salmon.

41250,B000FRS9NI,AXRCFE9M2DI52,Suzanne Nipp,1/1,1261526400,Can't do without it!,I started using Flavor Doh after trying pill pouches which are expensive and inconvenient.  It is easy and very inexpensive to use especially when daily medication is necessary.  I just dip some out with the capsule and stick another small pill on the tip and Duke gobbles it down.  He runs to me when I tell him it's time for pills.  Duke is a 6 year old toy poodle.
41256,B000FRS9NI,AJMJWAB35RSAD,Tom,0/0,1243555200,Flavor-Doh 1,I think it smells pretty real. We have two dogs. one will eat anything. the other is very smart. They both take this product. but they are cautious of what we are hiding in it I guess. We use it with the other things we give our dogs so they get their meds everyday.
41257,B000FRS9NI,A3I3B82LR2SPC5,E. Hagan Xweetie,0/0,1236816000,My dogs refused to eat it,This is just from my experience with my two toy dogs.  I bought this after searching the web for something more economical than Pill Pockets. with which I had great success.  Both my dogs refused to even lick this after a brief sniff and one of them eats anything.<br /><br />I gave the tub away to someone else to try with their larger dogs.<br /><br />YMMV Hope it works for you if you take a chance and buy it.
41264,B001993UR6,AA48Z9PKOONPM,J. Koplan juditha99,4/4,1263081600,Great high protein with touch of sweet,I really like these cinnamon crisps as a high protein snack with just a touch of sweet.  I do think they have a good cinnamon flavor. so my tastes are clearly different than the other reviewer.  I have been using these. as well as the other flavor (I especially like Italian Herb and Zesty Ranch in addition to the Cinnamon) for a couple of years and continue to enjoy them.  Really appreciate the way they curb my hunger and appetite for several hours. too!
41278,B00427ZLOM,A1VNFOV5225CU,Sara,2/2,1313712000,Great cat food,After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure. he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food. but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken. turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots. peas and green beans. but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers. and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.
41302,B00427ZLOM,A18AGGEOI4UPTL,D. Krizik misara,0/0,1305504000,Great quality.cats love it,My big boy (21.6 lbs) was put on an all-meat diet and he LOVES this food. It is a little less solid (slightly soupy) but my cats love that about it. They even eat all the little veggie pieces in it. Our feral deck cat leaves the peas behind. though.  It's hilarious. If it wasn't so darn expensive. I would buy more of it.
41304,B00427ZLOM,A3OF76YJBXYM01,Catowner,1/4,1309219200,Dented cans,I ordered 2 cases of Halo cat food for a total of 24 cans.  Fully half the cans arrived seriously dented to the point that I wonder if the food inside is still viable.  It also makes me wonder if the supplier is offloading seconds to Amazon consumers....that would NOT be cool.  I came to Amazon to avoid Petco. the only local supplier.  But badly dented cans may force me to look elsewhere for the product which my cat enjoys.
41306,B007MB8RW8,A2EUIXND4IWNS3,amagal,2/3,1344211200,late arrival. stale product. not what was pictured,I ordered a case of Cracker Jacks. I selected this product because it showed as the old school packaging and that went well with what my client was looking to do. The product arrived quite late (which meant delivery of custom amenity gifts were late to the client). The packaging was incorrect - not the old school design that I ordered - just the regular design. The cracker jacks boxes themselves were crushed and looked terrible. The experation date was a month out (which means the product was quite old because cracker jacks have a long shelf life). The product inside the boxes was so hard and stuck together - wach box had a hard rectangular mass of carmel corn.<br /><br />I did send an email when it was late and the apologized for the late delivery.<br /><br />Terrible order experience overall. I spent a lot of money and now wish I had not.

Only complaint is that the velcro in the front is a bit too tight to give quick access and the pocket in the rear is a bit small for an empty poop bag. Otherwise. very easy to use. Highly recommend.

They best compliment is when the kids ask. can we make another batch. and they like it better than the movie.  Our friends have tried it and have asked for what we use as our popcorn recipe.  How cool is that!?

Misty is very picky.  Since I started her on Fancy Feast Gourmet she would rather go hungry than eat anything else. And sometimes she won't eat her dry food!!!  There was one time when she went a day and a half without eating ANYTHING!!!!  I had put another popular food in her bowl but it just sat there while she meowed at me.  Dumb me!!!  She is my angel as well as my pet.  She woke me up one time when I stopped breathing - she literally crawled all over me.  She isn't beautiful except to me - she has gray fur all over except for one hand-sized white round spot on her tummy. It is worth it to me to give her the best.

My usual favorite blacks run thirty to fifty a pound.<br /><br />When I opened the bag I was amazed at the smell...it was just as good as the berry tea at Wegman's (NE premium grocery chain).  I just made my first using the adagio ingenuiTEA brewer.  You can definitely taste the berry. but it's on the weaker side compared to Wegman's.  The tea was smooth and seems to be low in caffeine.<br /><br />I honestly don't think it's worth the MSRP of thirty eight per pound (or even the current price of thirty).  The only reason I took the risk on a pound was that. at the time I purchased. it was on sale and there was a coupon which brought it down to twelve per pound.  For the price I paid it's  a steal.  I have a feeling this will make some really incredible iced tea.<br /><br />FYI - My ratings are based SOLELY on the product itself and not the manufacturer. price. purchase. shipping or some other stupid reason.  All of those are NOT related to the product and can happen to any product you buy!!!  Come on people. when you write a review stick to the PRODUCT not some other random reason.
41439,B0088YBUOU,A3DGMXQVIT6R31,Tendaena,3/3,1194134400,Tasty and easy to make,I really like this product.  It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave.
41447,B0088YBUOU,AVCA516CFZ9HF,S. Fowler,1/1,1335139200,so good!,These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these.
41456,B0088YBUOU,A14L15JM990MBP,David Barnes Scenic City Dave,0/0,1287014400,Taters ...,I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger. steak or chicken entree. Try them. You'll like them!
41464,B00141QYSQ,A6KL17KKN0A5L,K. Harper,12/12,1335225600,Made in China. that's all you need to know.,I don't have to say too much as these are made in China. I was shocked when Dogswell products are switched from made in USA to made in China without letting us consumers know. I think it's very sneaky to increase their profit that way. but still charge us consumers the same price they used to charge when they are actually made in USA. I am VERY disappointed in Dogswell.
41480,B00141QYSQ,A2RFNQTBNK1SXF,Laura Krasell,1/1,1279065600,Expensive but worth it.,My Rottie. with a sensitive stomach. is able to tolerate these treats well.  The best part is she actually has to chew them for a few moments...if you have a Rottwieler you know what I mean.  Any treat is chomped on in 1 second and gone... I feel good about these treats because they seem very healthy for large dogs...although. my daughters Chiauau loves them !
41505,B00141QYSQ,A38T7TRL7WXZ50,Avid Chef Lee,0/0,1350432000,My Dogs Love Them,My two Springers are 12 and 9 years of age. They love Happy Hips! The Chicken and Banana variety is their favorite. Try it!
41533,B00141QYSQ,A1PHEW6DG2PXAF,Avid Reader,1/2,1296864000,I own a finicky shih-tzu!,I own a shih tzu that hardly eats anything. and as far as treats go will only eat Happy Hips and (groan!)- Snausages!  Unbelievable!  He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon. but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35. vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.
41538,B004S4O7CQ,A56LERBVGWGET,Thomas Jones,2/2,1330905600,Best sauce ever. but beware of description,The pasta sauce is extremely good.  The best I've ever had.  It is really good and has relatively low sodium (240mg per half cup) and relatively low saturated fat (1.5g per half cup).  Usually companies load their sauces with salt and high saturated fat cream to make their product taste good.  This company does not do that and the product is amazingly good and tastes very fresh.<br /><br />The problem is the description on Amazon as it reads below.  Before I ordered I even did an online chat to confirm that 6 cans would be sent.  However only one was sent.  The price is too high for one can as it can be purchased cheaper in the grocery store or in bulk at other places. even on Amazon I believe.  I paid $11.99 for it thinking I was getting 6 cans which would be an amazing deal.  The grocery store (Whole Foods) sells it for $7.99-$8.99 per 19.6 oz can.  Amazon needs to fix the product feature description as it is wrong.<br /><br />Product Features<br />Description: PASTA SCE.CRMY TOMATO RC Quantity: 6 Size: 19.6 OZ Brand: LUCINI<br /><br />The Quanity: 6 is not correct.  It should read Quanity: 1<br /><br />Anyway. the product itself is very good.  Everyone's taste buds are different but when I say it's the best I've ever had. I really mean it.  It has to be made by hand or something.  You can get it cheaper so shop around.
41548,B000FNADGI,A17ZT0GEW8IWBW,Meghan Ross,1/1,1214956800,Yum. delicious crackers!,I really love these crackers.  I'm not much of a fan of Cheese-Its. but these are far better.  There's something more appealing about the texture--lighter is the best word I can come up with for it.  The cheese flavor is good. too.  My husband and two-year-old also think they are great.
41549,B000FNADGI,AXVNVV5VH5XZY,Lou Who Cindy,1/1,1206576000,Great taste and healthy. too,I discovered these crackers at a small grocery on a beach trip last year. My large local grocery in a major metropolitan city took forever to start carrying them. and they were more expensive. I was very happy to see Amazon have them on a special Kashi deal. and in bulk.<br /><br />As for the product itself...I love the natural cheese flavor. I've never been a Nips fan. because the flavor tasted fake. too salty. and left an unpleasant after taste. These Kashi crackers have great texture. crunch. and taste. and they are a healthy snack. too. I eat them alone. or with a nice crisp apple. Yum!!
41575,B000GB7RV8,A4BBF6ZHH0M0H,D. Burt,2/2,1248652800,Excellant health benefits,I just got into drinking Matcha and have been fascinated by it. This is an excellant product for a reasonable price. I have been drinking it once a day and this quantity of a half pound will last 3-4 months. Not bad for $16. I greatly enjoy the calmness of mind and energy it gives me. I like to add a little honey to it. For a good read on its health benefits check out the amnio acid that is in it called L-theanine.
41581,B000GB7RV8,A2EX8FQAA0W4ST,Ophelia,1/1,1291680000,not as intersting as i thought,This is my first experience with matcha powder tea made at home.  It is difficult to get to froth and much more of the powder is needed than I originally thought.  I like the taste (bitter) but don't see much benefit to powder vs loose tea.  Although. clean up is very easy.
41619,B000NIHZMU,A3Q5W7NJOWZJEZ,M.Joy,0/1,1342828800,Tastes Very Strong and Harsh,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!! I'm so glad that Amazon makes GOOD on BAD product. I had to return after I got sick from drinking it.<br /><br />There was no mfg. date on can as indicated. this could have been the problem too.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch. but this is horrible!!!
41626,B003WO1JCE,A24ZV048V7J0MT,Murphy Goldenmom,0/0,1326499200,Good for Travelling,I bought these thru warehouse deals so I could take orange juice to work daily.  These are quick and easy to take and just enough for a quick beverage in the morning to take some vitamins.  Would buy again once I finish this large box.
41627,B0035MWDWS,A1FI9Q8KOYVVBR,JLDET5,1/1,1287705600,Great Taste!,Best tasting agave so far and I've tried many of the popular store carried brands.
41646,B006ABD1SG,A31AS7L29JTV6H,G. Baker nJoyLife,12/12,1314921600,Wow,Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes. it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly. though. I think it seems creamy. Yea. I know that sounds weird. but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.
41651,B006ABD1SG,AI5SG3N6F0RMN,John Ron-Je',8/10,1314316800,Great stuff.and a must to have,I got into salts. the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt.  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals. depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though . remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine. so make sure you continue to use table salt. though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak.  trust me.
41653,B006ABD1SG,A9TPV4O2YQJXO,loves purses,3/3,1334534400,mm mm good,Love this salt.  It has a really nice flavor. not too salty. has a mineral taste that is very good.
41667,B004VLVOJ0,A1P2FJK2MOJ8IN,YUMSTER EURO FOODIE,0/0,1330041600,EVERYTHIGN LOOKS GOOD,Just got the package. Fast and well packaged. nice box inside.<br />Ordered their products before. always very good quality<br />and never a disappointment or surprise.
41670,B001YXXKTK,A1Z5OZ1YN481NY,V. Eileen Wagner,2/3,1271203200,I Love This Tea,This is one of the best Mystic Chai teas and I have been drinking it for several years. My order always comes on time and in excellent condition.<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXXKTK>Mystic Chai Spiced Tea - 2 - 2 lb cans</a><br />I have tried other Chai teas. but I like that this product doesn't have all the caffeine that other products have. I have also purchased the Vanilla Mystic Chai and I like that one equally well. The only thing that I don't like about my last order was that the shipping was so expensive and therefore the tea is now getting to the point that it's no longer cost effective to order it off of the Internet.
41674,B001YXXKTK,A1G38RFCCKN49E,Lynn,0/0,1326240000,Mystic Chai review,I love Mystic Chai and tried to purchase it where I always did. and was told that they weren't making it anymore.  When I saw it on Amason. I was estatic.  It was cheaper on Amason than with the manufacturer.
41676,B001YXXKTK,A2EJLNXWFHN2X,ohabby1,0/0,1322611200,MYSTIC IS THE BEST CHAI BRAND!!,I am a chai-aholic. I don't drink coffee and discovered chai a long time ago at starbucks. We used to get this from sam's club but then they stopped carring it and had another brand called Enchanted Chai...just not the same taste! So don't waste your time with any other brand!!! I just googled the Mystic brand one day and found it on amazon. I don't mind paying a little more to get my fix. haha...it really is the best tasting chai. I always mix it with milk...:)
41679,B001YXXKTK,A1V4QNUYM7LBW1,J. S. Hall,0/0,1292025600,Great Stuff,This stuff is great. As good as anything I've had at Starbucks. Smooth and rich. Full of flavor. Very satisfying and warming on a cold day. It's not low-cal though. so be careful how much you drink. One cup is 4 Weight Watcher PointsPlus points.
41681,B007CLPY7O,AQA7YU5Z17M9H,Dollface,0/0,1340323200,yummmy,I was SOOO happy to find this online! I saw it once around Valentine's Day then it was gone! Pink Lemonade cakes are a favorite and I was glad I could buy it again. About the shipper: came on time..no issues there!
41692,B001P20FCU,A1X224R6D0ZJV0,Sheila,1/1,1285372800,Artisan Salt Co. Himalayan Pink Salt-fine,Buying this item was a real shot in the dark. Mother has high blood pressure and this was an alternative salt product. We are VERY pleased with the way it tastes. It has a little bit stronger taste so don't need to use as much as you do table salt in order to get the same flavor. We bought the three pack. hoping we wouldn't be sorry. and we aren't! Love this product!
41697,B001ESOQ9I,A26TGTJ8T2KDBD,Todd Kuhns,0/0,1342656000,Pourable peanut butter,When you absolutely must have your peanut butter in liquid form. this brand can't be beat.<br /><br />It was a commonly-requested item for sundaes in our ice cream parlor. and it's perfect for shakes as well. Just don't forget to stir it up first if it's been sitting there a while.
41702,B0000SXEMI,A1G33IRDH6H7PX,Susanne Sue,0/0,1276300800,Great dessert,This is one of my favorites for a light dessert.  Great after a fish dinner or salad supper.  Refreshing in the summertime: light texture and delightful taste.
41732,B000COEZWS,A1SRP005B3D04Q,Stacie,0/0,1289174400,Great Product....Great Company,I have been purchasing pill pockets for about 6 months now due to my 7 yr old Beagle needing her medicine twice a day.  She is excited to eat them everyday and doesn't have a clue her medicine is in them....or doesn't care because of the yummy taste.  The price was excellent compared to the $9 - $12 for one packet in most pet stores.  More suprisingly was the customer service I received.  After sending an email requesting money back for my expedited shipping costs as I did not think I received my order in time. I quickly got a response.  A representative from the company explained exactly how expedited shipping actually worked (I wish Amazon was this detailed) and that they were in fact within the time limit as promised.  I received several emails back that not only answered all my questions. but also educated me on the whole shipping process.  I appreciated the personalized service I received. and can't wait to buy from them again!
41734,B000COEZWS,ASEV3UG6XKYM4,Mr Roberts Mr. Roberts,0/0,1285977600,My dog goes NUTS for these!!!,I used to try and smash my dogs pill in some moist food but my dog would somehow pick it out and I would find the pill on the floor.  Now with these I just pop the pill in and my dog jumps up and snatches it out of my hand. I dont think she even chews it!  Makes giving pills much easier and smells a little like bacon....Mmmmmmm...Bacon!
41738,B000COEZWS,A1Z818IB1AOD7F,William W. Nicholas rcflyer,0/0,1261180800,Excellent choice for pet owner's who have difficulty with medicinal requirments,What a nice product to dispense medication for pets. Some pets don't take kindly to fingers jammed down their throats. The pill holder .akes it easy!
41742,B000COEZWS,A1UTWMAQP39NVC,Lisa,0/0,1229558400,Great product,Well. we ordered the beef pockets and got chicken instead. Fortunately my dog will eat either kind so I wasn't too upset. Order arrived very quickly. These pill pockets are the best if you have dogs who don't take pills well. My dog thinks she is getting a treat every morning.
41752,B0000D8DI0,AHTWQSOY6HTJI,Mitch Baywatch,4/4,1111449600,a bit too mild for me,This is definitely a mild-tasting chocolate. Texturally. it's very glossy and hard (it really snaps when you break off a square).<br /><br />I personally don't think Hachez is worth the price. but I prefer wilder. rougher chocolate with a bit more bite to it.
41762,B000FFM7UQ,A2RIPJ4G9IP34H,K. Ratliff,1/1,1226793600,Very nice!,Very refreshing as an iced tea.  Mint is subtle and not overpowering.  Also nice hot.  Had enjoyed it at one of the coffee shops where I live. but was unable to find it in any local stores. so was glad to find it on Amazon.  Worth a try - highly recommended.
41766,B000FFM7UQ,ADMWYMH11LD27,Phillip Roncoroni goodcowfilms.com,1/3,1167436800,Too strong. not minty enough...,I like Numi teas. but I found this flavor to be far too strong. and not nearly as minty as I'd expected it to be.<br /><br />Not a bad tea. just disappointing considering the flavor name.
41767,B001EO5OIE,A20UHCO9LE2LFK,John Dwyer,6/6,1297814400,Hot Smoked Salmon,This is a hot smoked wild caught Alaskan pink salmon. prepared in the traditional Native American Style. not European Style cold smoked Lox.  This product is best served at room temperature. rather than cold. which is what the previous reviewer probably did. thinking they had purchased lox.  The 'goo' that came out of their pouch was probably the result of the refrigeration.  I've been eating this product for several years (they opened back about 25 years ago) and I've never had 'goo' come out of a package.<br /><br />A note about the smell. cold smoked lox doesn't have nearly the strong smoked salmon smell/taste as hot smoked salmon. so it can be a big surprise for those who aren't familiar with the product.<br /><br />Personally. I prefer Sockeye over Pink Salmon. however both products are very tasty.  It's great to serve with cheese and crackers. or to break up and add to an alfredo pasta dish.  Just remember. it isn't lox!
41795,B000G1X45Q,A1UOOTA5UES1DH,Michele Ross,0/0,1268092800,best coffee,Love this coffee.  It has the best flavor I've ever tasted.  The decaf has no distinguishing flavor difference from the regular; unlike most other brands.
41816,B0090X8JUG,A3GUE3RUGPJ2U3,Brian Loggains,0/0,1347062400,Wonderful Coffee Blend,This came in phenomenal time.  I was shocked at how fast it arrived.  The coffee itself does taste like caramel. but it's not too sweet nor does it have that strange aftertaste that some flavored coffees can have.  I would use this seller again in a heartbeat and look forward to trying more of their coffee.
41821,B0090X8JUG,A17C5OPW0AWIH2,M. Davis Techwomans,0/0,1317254400,Horrible odor. Smells like no coffee I ever enjoyed.,I love coffee. and have a terrible addiction to Starbucks! So. when I was in the coffee aisle looking for a nice flavor to try I saw the Starbucks Caramel Natural Fusions. I was so excited to set up my coffee maker so that all I had to do was hit the switch in the morning! There is nothing I love more than the smell of fresh coffee when a new package is opened but when I opened up this coffee I almost gagged. The smell was overwhelming. sort of like burnt dirt. It was extremely dark in color too. almost like soil. I still have yet to hit the brew button on the coffee maker tomorrow morn. but I figure I would give it a fair shot. After reading some of the reviews here tonight. I am already expecting to be tossing it down the drain.
41842,B0027VO330,ASPE8TT4N7V2X,plop plop,0/0,1348617600,could drink it!,This is the best marinara ever. period.  We even use it when we make pizza and 3-4 spoons of it always end up in my mouth.  I could drink it right out of the jar. it's that good. If you like thick. pasty. sugary pasta sauces better than this one. then leave it on the shelf for me!
41852,B005JZZ7ZE,A3QA67VNJACLEM,Rev. Aj Vollkommer andrewjv,0/0,1327017600,Absolutlely the best chocolate tea I have ever tasted!,All of my Serenity House Teas arrived today and they couldn't have arrived on a better day:  I had to have a 3 hour MRI and my back was terribly sore. it was miserable outside weather wise. cold. rainy. dark and dreary.  When I opened the box. the very first tea I came upon was the Double Double Chocolate.  I made a pot in my new Breville Automatic Tea Maker which has a automatic infuser basket which is wonderful for making the perfect pot of tea.<br /><br />I could smell the chocolate flavor filling the kitchen from the Double Double Chocolate leaves.  In fact when I opened the factory sealed bag from Serenity House the aroma of the chocolate tea leaves was so aromatic it was heavenly!<br /><br />When I poured the cup I thought I would need to add sugar but decided to take a sip first and I was glad I did!  The tea was perfect!  The chocolate flavor was out of this world!<br /><br />This is the perfect tea for anytime but especially when you may be feeling a little down. or you might have the need to lift someone's spirits as a gift. or a pick me up. or for that<br />special time when you want to tell someone you care or as a get well present to the chocolate lover in your life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea!<br /><br />I did buy 7 or 8 other teas from this vendor and I must say that I was highly impressed by the speed of shipment. the packaging. the way the teas were wrapped and the care they took to individualize my shipment.  I am very delighted with the service I received and I know I will be ordering again!<br /><br />By the way. the labeling on the Serenity House teas are perfect!  There are instructions on the front and very clear instructions on the back as well.  Unlike other teas that you order online from other vendors. Serenity House takes all the guess work out of how to make the perfect cup of tea!<br /><br />Thank you. thank you. thank you!
41860,B00141NFVA,A131S7JQCEPFOM,Kormina Kormina,7/7,1237507200,Great Value!,We tried this product and our Mini Schnauzer just loved the entire Happy Hips line. You really get the best value here. I've checked all our Feed Stores in the area and could not find a lower price. We even subscribed to the Auto Ship and it comes to our door automatically ever 60 days. Gotta love it!
41865,B00141NFVA,A1R67RRO3H5OW4,M&gt;E&gt;R,0/0,1331769600,The Best,My dog loves this food and the first ingredient is not corn....What a pleasure to have this big bag of dog food delivered right to my front door. instead of carrying it in from the market.  I used to spend 90 dollars on healthy food at the pet store.  This is the best bargain. very healthy and the dog loves it. Also has chondrotina and glucosomine for aging dog... He is thirteen and recovered from an accident I credit the food. Thanks
41868,B00141NFVA,A3PB6BLMPO8XUP,Michael Beck,1/7,1302566400,Dog hates eating it. gives him diarrhea and I can't blame him from the looks of it,For a premium cost and marketed food. this doesn't look very premium. I can buy much cheaper food (less than half the price) at PetSmart that has actual chunks of meat and more importantly that my dog doesn't sniff and turn away from - and dogs will eat ... well lets just say just about anything<br />Bought it because of the supposed benefits for dogs with hip problems. but not worth the cost.
41876,B003TV9KSU,A3TL0E7VAKL8ZS,farmer,0/0,1350172800,The best popcorn salt ever,Had damage on one of four items and the company is fully compensating me for it and I and many friends really like this particular Act II popcorn salt product.
41884,B0010WD2BG,AKDUUWN0WCSEU,Stamp Lady,0/0,1325462400,A great Christmas treat,We have always had Quality Street chocolates at Christmas time and it was so nice to be able to order them on line and have them arrive so quickly.  Unfortunately the chocolates disappeared just as quickly!  Next time I will have to order two tins to make sure they last the whole holiday. Thank you for supplying a great quality product that always brings back fond memories of Christmas!
41897,B006Q7YFLQ,AQOY760AVUEUH,L. Romero Luis from SD,0/1,1340841600,Both cats liked them,I have used this brand for my cats and they have liked it (different flavors of wet food including rabbit and duck). When it comes to treats. my two cats tend to have different taste. I got them these treats and they both liked them. The treats are about the size of a chicken nugget but they are very light and almost crumbly. They smell fishy to me but they are chicken. The directions say they are treats for dogs and cats and to give 1-2 for each 20 pounds. Since my cats are about 10lbs each I decided to split 1 between the two.<br />I have had a good experience with this brand and I recommend it.
41903,B006Q7YFLQ,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,W. T. Hoffman artist and musician,1/1,1345075200,My Cat and I Share a RAW FOOD Diet,NATURE'S VARIETY INSTINCT RAW BOOST BITES FREEZE-DRIED TREATS (aka Boost Bites) provides a little treat for my cat. that isnt the JUNK FOOD normally found in name brand cat treats. The Friskies cat treats contain Brewers Rice. chicken meal. corn meal. animal fat. animal liver. malt. artificial flavors. brewers yeast. and a chemistry lab of various preservatives. and artificial colors.<br /><br /> Compare that to the RAW ingrediants of BOOST BITES: Chicken. Turkey. Turkey liver and heart. Pumpkin Seeds. Apples. Carrots. ground chicken bone. butternut squash. ground flaxseed. clay (for natural vitamins). broccoli. lettuce. spinach. kelp. vinegar. parsley. honey. salmon oil. olive oil. Vitamin E. Rosemary. blueberries. Alfalfa sprouts. permissons. sage. and clove.<br /><br />The BOOST BITES are a RAW FOOD. For years I've been eating a raw food diet for dinner. consisting of MUESLI. Muesli was invented by a Swiss doctor. consisting of various raw grains. dried fruit. and unbaked seeds and nuts. soaked in soy milk. The concept behind raw foods. is that cooking destroys the enzymes in food. as well as many vitamins. which our body requires. If I'm going to eat a raw diet for my health. I might as well share that benefit with my cat. Our pets arent that different than us. and i'm NOT anthopomorphizing. They require these raw enzymes just like we do. and our pets are healthier with them. If I didnt believe in the health benefits of raw food. I wouldnt spend the extra money for Muesli.<br /><br />Needless to say. a raw food diet means nothing to my cat. He eats Boost Bites cos he thinks they taste great. In fact. I gave him a taste test. placing a bit of BOOST BITES. next to his Friskies treats. He goobled down the Boost Bites. and left the Friskies Treats lay there untouched. (Tho he ate those too. when he figured out he wasnt getting more Boost Bites.)These cost a bit more than the treats from the grocery store. but they are his vitamin suppliment. Along with the EFA fish oil capsels I squeeze on his food. my cat's recieving an excellent diet. His digestion is good. and his coat doesnt flake off all this excessive dander. that used to cause him to scratch himself raw. A healthy cat is a happy cat. And a happy cat. is a happy cat owner.
41936,B006Q7YFLQ,A2E7RX6AFUDQEX,Elizabeth Finlay,0/0,1344902400,healthy. happy snack,I wanted to really use the treats a few different times and such to make sure they didn't upset donny's stomach and be able to give a more detailed review. :) Thanks for sending me treats - Donny (and now Bella) love it. :)<br /><br />So for the Raw boost bites:<br />I really liked these treats because they were such a novelty and treat and my dog gobbled them up super fast. I think I they would better if they were smaller so that the dog doesn't swallow a huge disc of a treat. I really enjoyed knowing that I was giving my dog a really healthy treat every time and it wasn't going to add to his waistline too much. I think due to the large size of the treat and having a small dog I would see if there was a smaller treat size then I would buy them. They would be great for a larger dog though so you wouldn't have to worry about the large size of the treat.
41944,B006Q7YFLQ,A3N4CUW4UYC9I3,MH,0/0,1344211200,Very nutritious and convenient,I was really happy to have these Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried chicken treats when my dog wasn't feeling well and wasn't eating a lot of food.  I broke them into little pieces and gave them to her as a snack.  She likes stuff like this much better when she thinks it is a treat. rather than presenting it as a meal.  I have purchased other Nature's Variety products quite often in the past. but this is my first time getting the freeze dried treats.  I like that meat. fruit. and vegetables are the main ingredients and feel confident in feeding this to my dog.  The only reason I removed a star from the rating is because of the price.  It is quite expensive for the amount offered.  I will probably continue to buy another brand (Stella & Chewy's) freeze dried options because the price. while still high. is much better for the amount of product and my dog seems to like them both the same.
41947,B006Q7YFLQ,A3R5GTYQ50QVMD,M. Gravel,0/0,1344038400,Dog loves them!,I was a little apprehensive when I saw that it was also a cat product but he loves them.  He is a very picky eater plus he is diabetic so I have to careful about what he gets feed.<br /><br />But according to my dog Duke-he gives it a thumbs up!
41953,B006Q7YFLQ,A33UZDO4KB4S0H,J. Weber,0/0,1343260800,Dogs loved them,I can only give this item 4 stars because I didn't eat them myself. so my review contains second hand ( oops! Paw). Information.  WhatnI liked. natural ingredients. What the dogs liked..were the treats! Readily eaten up and looking for more. It takes a bit of work to find all natural treats fo r your pet. so I'd definitely buy these again.
41958,B006Q7YFLQ,A3L1MEXXDI4Q77,Miranda Prince Punky Monkey,0/0,1342656000,My dogs like them,All I can say about these treats is they are not too nasty (they smell OK. and they are not slimy). and my dogs like them. They are very easy to break into smaller pieces. which is good since each one is about the size of an Oreo cookie. Recommended.
41980,B006Q7YFLQ,A1UG4J8DEG9NVW,ResearchingMom,0/0,1341619200,the cats all liked them!,Looks like good ingredients in these. and amazingly all three cats liked them. a lot.  Glad to find a convenient raw treat. will be buying again.  We have only tried the chicken flavor.
41981,B006Q7YFLQ,A3D9NUCR4RXDPY,Kathleen San Martino,0/0,1341532800,My four cats would not eat this,My four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them.<br /><br />The treat to human eyes is totally unappealing. Not only are they freeze-dried raw but they look hairy (similar to a dust bunny I would find under the bed). In size. they are the circumference and height of a double-stuffed Oreo cookie. They are also very light and as easy to break up as a wafer.<br /><br />I broke several into smaller bite-sized pieces and left them out overnight.  One of my cats looked like he was going to take a bite but eventually walked away. The other three smelled the pieces and left without even trying them.<br /><br />The box of the Chicken Formula Raw Boost Bites claims these treats are for cats and dogs and are made of chicken. turkey. turkey liver. turkey heart. pumpkinseeds. apples. carrots. ground chicken bone. etc.  Each large piece is 23 calories and they recommend 1 to 2 pieces per 20 pounds of body weight.  However. since my four cats won't eat them. I'm going to throw out all this goodness to the wildlife.  Maybe some critter will eat it.

Its so hard to find great tasting GF items that everyone enjoys. Will definitely be ordering more very soon! Thank you for making such a great item.
42000,B003ZTROQQ,A1XWQAMW9ITXKB,Dorit,6/6,1314576000,great for soups,I have really enjoyed this.  I can make a soup vase or sauce withouut adding meat. my favorit is to use it as a base to cook southern peas and greens. it replaces those fatty ham hocks
42010,B006T15BWQ,A2LOF372G8V0TY,Monica F,0/0,1348444800,Cat Likes it,We got this for our senior kitty. who is a picky eater but loves wet food (which makes his breath pretty horrible) and treats.  He likes these treats.  His breath does seem improved - not great. but better - and we'll take what we can get in that department.  Since the treats do seem to have some effect. he likes the treats. and he needs the calories to boot. we will buy again.

42120,B0012DMI1S,AANY1QAL90G2A,Rzeznik,0/0,1344384000,Good quality...good price,This product worked really well and I am happy with my purchase. I used them for cake pops and they wrote vibrant and easy. unlike the Wilton ones I purchased before these. DO NOT buy Wilton if you are using them for cake pops. I didn't try them on other things. like fondant or gumpaste. but using the Wilton ones on cake pops was like writing on wax. The only thing I would suggest. would be to have a finer point tip on the Americolor pens. This would have made the lines cleaner and better looking.
42121,B0012DMI1S,AV2RHTM8OFSCI,Laura Bauer,0/0,1342051200,fun way to decorate cake pops,These food-safe markers work well on cake pops dipped in candy melts. They do not clog. and retain their tips well when care is used during application. I keep two sets: one for regular use. one for nut/tree-nut-free cake pops. I let my kids use the regular set to decorate plain cake pops or even just marshmallows. and even with less-than-careful use they last quite awhile in the fridge.
42123,B0012DMI1S,A3J3C230IVDB5W,L. Vaughn,0/0,1323388800,Great for pops,I've tried Wilton pens and they did not work well at all.  These pens work wonderful!  Exactly what I needed to write on cake pops

42132,B001ELL364,A14OZUBJGG209V,GlutenFreeCook,10/10,1258761600,Fine Flour!,I've ordered this millet flour in bulk twice. and I'm about to order it a third time. None of it was expired. It was fine. I use it A LOT and have never had a problem.
42133,B001ELL364,AYWUB7U79ECQA,TM,9/9,1264723200,Remember to contact Amazon if unhappy,I just got my first subscription order for this item.  I set it up for every 6 months.  The items that came only had a 5-month expiration period from my order date.  I simply contacted Amazon.com to let them know I would expect to have at least a 6-month period based on my use needs and. just like that. they are trying to resolve the issue with a replacement. at no charge. and say they will refund it all if the freshness issue remains.  With the amazing cost savings with this product from them and no s/h fees with a subscription refill and the fact that they are standing behind the quality of it with no back and forth arguing or excuse making. I have to give a 5 star rating.  This kind of service is so hard to find anymore.  I recommend using them to get this. especially if. like me. there are no stores willing to stock it or. if they do. they charge 3-5x the price noted here.
42134,B001ELL364,A3JDZCX200154D,E. A. Davidson,6/6,1243123200,Economical source of Millet Flour,This is nice flour. maybe a little coursely ground but tastes very good in gluten free baked goods.  The bags were not short-dated or torn but they were very beat up (maybe by the shipping - they were packed loose in a HUGE box with a few air pillows so they rattled around in the box).  The product tastes as fresh as any I have purchased at my local stores.  The price is good.  This keeps very well when stored in the freezer in a ziploc bag.

42179,B000NP5A7K,A24NDM8VZ4VNU8,L. Beeler,2/2,1319932800,Yummy,After my family became ill from eating bacteria infected salad greens bought at our local grocery store. I went to .fda.gov/Safety/Recalls and found out how much of our produce is being recalled......after they have been shipped. purchased. and eaten. What a shock!<br />So. I've looked at the cute electric over engineered and highly expensive gourmet salad growing machines.  And compared the cost to the tried and true sprouts.<br />These sprouts were very viable. I didn't see any that didn't sprout.  They aren't finicky about their growing condition. I just threw mine in a mason jar. didn't even dig my old sprouting trays out of the store room.  The seeds sprouted right away. and this is November so it's coolish in my kitchen.  I've tasted them as the seeds sprouted and found them very tasty from the moment they sprouted. to the point where they were big enough to classify as a salad.  These may be a bit pricey. but the nearest Whole Foods market is too far away for convenience.  I will check on the sprouting seed price the next time I'm across town and update on the price comparison.
42180,B000633VBG,AMQ1MEG334SAP,Bigmac,0/0,1322611200,A Big Ripoff!,I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff. and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact. corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention. thanks to our friends at Monsanto. it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food. unless it's organic. Real premium dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products. another no-no among real premium dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap. but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA. an artificial preservative. which again real premium dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short. BilJac is a joke. It is basically. insanely overpriced Alpo. with no organic ingredients whatsoever. and uses all the shortcuts. filler. and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag. and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap. lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.
42183,B000E39T82,AJFCXGI8GYYIX,C. D. G. shelbygirl,6/6,1255824000,Kitchen Staple,This is an excellent all around seasoning product that I use a lot of.  My only complaint is that I think the sodium content is a little high. therefore I make sure to use plenty of liquid with whatever I am adding this to so that it's not too salty.  I wish Rapunzel offered this broth product in a jar with lower sodium.  I use other Rapunzel products. they are always top-notch.
42184,B000E39T82,A3QJQQZTKFV7BJ,Sandy WR Gma,6/6,1239494400,Great standby,Terrific product. Takes up little room in the cabinet and always handy to turn water into a tasty vegetable broth.
42215,B001ET5XX0,A2RTR2E8SN5I8F,VRW prettysymmetry,1/3,1258329600,Best bang for your buck,For you coffee connoisseurs out there. here is the bold. smooth flavor you've been waiting for. My husband asked me for something robust b/c he kept coming up empty.  Having grown up with this coffee I was quite familiar with it but with the advent of gourmet prepared coffee a l&agrave; Starbucks. I'd forgotten all about it.  When. I looked at our monthly bank statement an looked at our expenditure.  I decided it was time to brew at home (Keurig anyone?).  I went to the local supermarket and actually ended up throwing away a freshly ground 5 lb bag b/c it smelled well but tasted awfully.  I remembered what he asked for: bold. smooth. tasty. Bustelo! I went to my local supermarket and found it.  I said Give it a try and if you don't like it - then I'll buy the $14 Juan Valdez bag.  He absolutely loved it!  After not tasting it for about 10 years. I forgot what I was missing.  This is a MUST TRY for any coffee lover.
42233,B000GSMFT0,A3LF5PS9QL9BH9,Cathy,0/0,1336435200,Best Olive Oil Ever,I received a bottle of Mustapha's Moroccan Extra Virgin Olive Oil as a gift. It's the best olive oil I have ever tasted. I've tried various brands you can find at the average grocery store. but this! It has such flavor! So fruity! So light. I used it in salad dressings. spaghetti sauce. sauteeing onions and/or garlic. etc. It made everything more flavorful. I highly recommend it. Yes. it's pricy. but wow!
42242,B0002TR6D8,A4K4FNLA02QS2,Maryanne M. Prince,0/0,1179792000,Great for Cats too.,My cat would sell her soul for these.  She loves. loves. loves her chicken liver treats.  These are nothing but great soft cubes that are not hard on a kitties teeth.  If you are looking for a pure nothing added treat for cat or dog - try these.
42280,B000V1D19A,A2I5QH4F5FDKK5,*rose*,1/1,1239580800,Very good,This tastes very good and it's very easy to make.<br /><br />I didn't like this as much as I liked the Butter Chicken Curry. though (also from Kitchens Of India).  The Butter Chicken Curry is WONDERFUL.  This one has a darker heavier flavor to me.  But. we did still enjoy it very much.
42295,B000V1D19A,AM3T0RTM322F3,N. Wei une_fille,0/0,1330300800,Great aroma and taste,I buy this very often (Fresh and Easy sells these for about $2-3 a packet).  I cook it with organic chicken breast. veggies. and a little bit of coconut milk.  This has a wonderful aroma and the serving size is perfect for 2-3 people.  I serve it over quinoa as an alternative to rice.  It's delicious!

42345,B0002IF5CI,A3R0O7UT6EUJXK,Brian S. Gregory,0/0,1326931200,Fantastic Bacon!,Fantastic bacon.  It hardly shrinked at all when cooked and there wasn't a pan full of grease afterwards.  My wife found it too smokey flavored for her taste but I thought it was great.  We haven't tried the peppered bacon yet but looking forward to it.  This is expensive bacon as one reviewer complained about so it's not something you would have every weekend.  As an occasional treat though it's probably the best bacon I have ever had.
42347,B0002IF5CI,A2MK7HT4A2P0CN,Montego Bay Montego Bay,0/0,1311120000,Best Bacon Ever,This is simply the best bacon I have ever eaten. It fries nice and is delicious! I think it well worth the price.
42351,B001EO5NAS,A3SPMWXQYQ5OIQ,Barbara Byrd womanofworth,2/2,1278460800,Great versatile produce,I have used these citrus oils extensively since I received them.  So much easier than having to grate the fruit.  These produce the same effect in a split second. and the result is subtle and delicious.
42356,B001EO5NAS,A23NGEOT9J2A6C,Dr Benjamin,0/0,1347321600,Concentrated citrus combo,I find these really good and economical in cooking. giving extremely concentrated lemon. lime and orange flavour with a drop or two. I use a dropper for convenience otherwise the lips of the small bottles deliver too much oil. Prior to the dropper idea I decanted a small quantity into a teaspoon.
42361,B001EO5NAS,A35LYPCCFVAAD1,A. Barnes,1/5,1321056000,No bargain!,I was disappointed to see the price for the Boyajian Mini Citrus set on Amazon; the exact same set is offered for only $10.95 at Sur la Table!

42403,B001BDI0RA,A1D106CTACVIA1,Maddy,3/3,1282953600,great starter food for kitten,I have a year old cat and she's at the end of her very last bag of Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula. I am very skeptical on what kinds of food I allow her to eat. I want the very best food for her and this product seemed to be the best. I had to also decide about Hills Science Diet but she would hardly even taste it! There are so many different kinds of dry cat/kitten foods that when all was said and done. Purina One really worked well. Purina One not only is good for her. but in addition also helped her develop a very shiny. soft coat. The ingredients are good/healthy. I'm now at the point of researching what kind of cat food she will be eating. but wanted to share that she (and I) had a very positive experience with Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula and would recommend it to future kittens!!
42406,B001BDI0RA,AFEU9SW8OTF55,Julianne Julie,3/4,1258329600,Prices better with Subscribe and Save,Cats and ferrets love this food.  Since we have a multiple-pet household. we are always looking for the best price.  The price on Amazon has been very good and at times. too high.  Currently. the subscribe and save price is a good deal. just make sure you compare prices before ordering.
42420,B008YA1R8W,A1LJRLJABEN9DS,Triplim,1/1,1328832000,Excellent Coffee!,A few years ago. I worked in a bed and breakfast and one of my favorite parts was the southern pecan coffee. I have since been trying to find a coffee that is comparable. This is it! Like one of the other reviewers. I don't care for super strong coffee. This coffee has a very smooth flavor and the pecan flavor does not take over the coffee...the two work beautifully together!
42425,B008YA1R8W,A2B88HGNUXREYT,Sarahlynn524,0/0,1349395200,Best morning coffee.,This is by far my favorite coffee to start the day with. It's nutty and smooth and not very strong. I'm not a fan of very bold blends of coffee so if you are. this is not the pod for you. It's delicious!

Almost made me wish I hadn't gotten rid of my keurig! After it broke a second time and seeing how devastating these are to the environment. I'm all set!  But to each their own. if use keurig. these pods are delicious.

After moving from Wisconsin to North Carolina so many years ago Rhubarb is one of the things the family missed.  It is very hard to find and very expensive when you do find it.  This made pie making over the holidays so easy.  Will order more to stock up.
42468,B00018CX60,A3Z2EP6ADV93X,M. A. Stevens,1/1,1250467200,Very Good Rhubarb Pie Filling,I was raised in Michigan and had fresh rhubarb pie on a regular basis.  This particular recipe is pretty good. and makes a very good pie.  I could of course compare it to my grandmother's pie and be critical. but instead just say that if you have not had rhubarb pie in a while. or never had it. this is one of the best and easiest<br />ways to re-introduce or introduce you to this wonderful pie.  My wife called Barry Farm prior to cooking the pie. and they were very nice and helpful with cooking and serving hints.<br /><br />Good filling. great customer service!  You'll love your pie.

I was VERY happy with these lamps since they give out such true sunlight.  The carton says that they should last for 5 years. assuming 3 hours of use seven days a week.  My usage pattern is just that.  But then they started burning out - four are done with already. in less than year.  Given how pricey these are. I am just not happy that these last just around a year.

This was a very good deal for 24 cans of Pedigree.  Love the fact that I could choose the kind I wanted to buy for her. Would recommended ordering this item and from this company. Item came well packaged for shipping and for storage. Item arrived on time as well.
42547,B001EQ5PKE,A4TK8ENW87B41,Lila Klu,3/3,1203984000,No. 1,A winner in my little test kitchen.  I've tried several other brands of stevia. and ended up coming back to Sweetleaf extract.  It has the cleanest taste and overall. is a good value.  Mixing is a little tricky. but the results are worth the extra care.  I use this mostly in hot beverages. smoothies. and sauces--using a mini measuring spoon I found on e(bay)--dash. pinch. smidge. etc.
42555,B001EQ5PKE,A2DNJS80LRIP9K,James Ike freedom costs,0/0,1345852800,Only half full or half empty,While it's good Stevia. my wife complained the jar is only half full. I weighed at 50g and the jar weighs 25g so it's the right amount. Still it seems half empty.
42558,B000VK5SYC,A1LXF7Z5I87BRM,J. Morrissey,2/2,1296432000,Pez are great. but beware the assortment...,This is a good deal on Pez. and what's not to like about Pez?<br /><br />However. the product is advertised as 'assorted'. which typically means just that.  The package I recieved was 4:2 Strawberry/Lemon packs. 12 sleeves of it. as opposed to packages of assorted flavors. These are not my favorite Pez flavors.<br /><br />Just something to be aware of before you buy.
42565,B000VK5SYC,A28E0YWFLRPMRZ,Gerald R. Townsend,0/0,1300320000,Arrived as advertised,Pez Candy is Pez candy. but I couldn't find it anywhere.  I now have a very happy little Grandson who has enough Pez for his Nemo dispenser to last and last. The assorted flavors are a good idea.

42592,B0039K56D4,ANFZJRBY0VV9D,Barbara Geidel,2/2,1289520000,Average coffee,This coffee was just ok.  It was very mild for a French Roast.  I probably will not purchase again.

We started supplementing with the Gerber Gentle. but our daughter had a bit of an allergy and reflux so we went with the Gerber Soy until she was 5 months. While transitioning back to the Gerber Gentle. we found that the  thinness of the powder formula really aggravated her reflux. This ready to feed works so much better for our family! The new packaging means less weight to carry in her diaper bag. I would give it 5 stars if the carton was resealable since she's only drinking about 5 of the 8.45 ounces.

I could not find it in upstate NY. so I purchased it online. It was delivered quicky and I am very happy with it. My only complaint would be the total price online. It is under $4 in the store ( if you can find it) and online it was $37 plus shipping for 6 bottles. which I thought was expensive. But when you have to have it. you have to have it!!!! :-)))
42604,B00129FVZC,A21DG8HA8O1BG7,Eric John Myers EricM,10/31,1326067200,NOT A LIVE CULTURE,I just wasted about an hour of my time and making a batch only to notice no bubbles after adding the yeast. So i googled barry farm brewers yeast<br />this is from the website........ Brewer's Yeast is a product of the brewing industry.  High in B vitamins and other nutrients. it is not a live yeast culture but rather a spent yeast. So unless you want to eat yeast this is not what your looking for.
42632,B006DK1Y4W,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,PT Cruiser PT Cruiser,0/0,1340668800,My favorite Mocktail,I first purchased this in a package <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DM1Z3Q>Crystal Light Mocktails Drink Mixes. 3-Flavors. 15-Count</a> along with the Appletini and Margarita flavors. The Appletini and Margarita were good. but not as good as this Mojito Drink Mix.  This has the taste of lime and is sweet but also a little tart. much like a real Mojito.  It also has a slight minty taste which I really like. It doesn't have aftertaste.<br /><br />Each canister contains 5 packets that will make 2 quarts each.  I usually use them in my <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P4BR3E>Contigo AUTOSPOUT® Addison 24 oz. Water Bottles 3 pack Blue. Charcoal. Honeysuckle</a> and just mix it to taste. It has 5 calories per serving which is 1/8 of a packet so it's good when you're trying to watch the calories.  The ingredients are: Citric Acid. Maltodextrin. Aspartame (Sweetener). Acesulfame Potassium (Sweetener). Sugar. Magnesium Oxide. Contains Less Than 2% of:. Natural Flavor. Yellow 5. Blue 1<br /><br />I like it best over ice.  I fill my water bottle about 3/4 of the way full add the Mojito Drink Mix and then fill the bottle the rest of the way with ice. It dissolves very easily. It also makes a good cocktail in a pinch if you add rum or vodka. Two thumbs up for this great product from Kraft Foods.
42640,B001WAL1O6,A1TEZJ9I8R99P7,Jianqiang Zhong Z Man,2/2,1326153600,Amazon service is 6 stars.,These bulbs make my room (painted blue) look absolutely vivid and beautiful. specially compared to my previous 27K CFL lightbulbs.<br /><br />I have ALZO 55K lightbulbs. love it so decided to change all my 27K CFL lightbulbs to 55K in my first floor. ALZO bulbs are way too big to fit most of my light fixtures. These ones are perfect size.<br /><br />I like to comment is the Amazon's service. Amazon sent me the package. the first shipment was wrong items. 27K bulbs. I returned and asked for replacement. Amazon shipped me the right one but with two broken light bulbs. I was not happy but not mad since this is the only issue I ever had with Amazon in my last few years. I bought all from Amazon unless it does not carry.<br /><br />Amazon shipped me the replacement with no charge. The person even opened the package to make sure no broken light bulbs. then wrapped an extra protection layer before putting into a already very good packaging box.<br /><br />I will buy more when I replace my another light fixture next month.<br /><br />Updated.<br />I have changed the rating to 3 from 5. One of the six bulbs just burned out after only 2 months usage.
42663,B000F0FX5C,A2SNDYGHDCJXLE,Bayou Child,2/2,1339545600,Just OK for me...,The Sprout Master is made nicely and looks like it will last a long time. However. it has pin-size holes for drainage. and doesn't seem to work well with small seeds.  I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds).  Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds. nuts. beans. wheat. or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean.  What happens with the small seeds. such as the broccoli sprouts. is that they grow their roots through the holes. and their roots make a thick mat underneath.  So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout.  The roots break off. so then we have only the tops of the sprouts.  I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too. but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken.  I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system. the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon).  It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store.  I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  I've done many comparisons. and it always is like this.  I am not sure why.  So. all things said. I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter.  I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead.  They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master.  I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds.  Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too. but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts. alfalfa sprouts. radishes sprouts. etc.. all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />The other thing about the Sprout Master. as others have noted. is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes.  You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes. the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse.  No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm.  Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher. so I have not.<br /><br />By the way. if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds. I would love to read your comments.  Thanks!

I found Neccos at a dollar store and began buying them again-but. for some reason. the Necco company decided to mess with perfection and re-formulated the flavors to reflect the ones they used many years ago (before my time)<br />And. sadly. they were horrible! I tried a roll and could not identify even one of the flavors-I threw them away and never bought them again.<br />Then one day I was checking something else out on Amazon.and they popped up-not the new and improved ones-but the ones I enjoyed from childhood!!<br />I then ordered 2 boxes of them from Amazon and have been in Necco heaven ever since!!

42711,B000OK2AG8,A1QK7RD0B0MVHY,M. Cavanaugh,6/6,1185235200,The Best Green Tea,I've tried many brands of green tea and this is by far the best.  The only thing better was a loose tea I bought in Japan.  Remember to let the water cool a little before adding the bag.  And I would suggest checking your local Asian market for a lower price.  I usually pay $19.00 for a pack of 100 bags.

I think that it might actually be a large peanut butter cookie with spreading of peanut butter. chips. and Reese's cups.
42765,B002NHYQAS,AYNAH993VDECT,bsg2004,0/0,1298592000,Dark Chocolate for Beginners (misnamed but tastes good),Perhaps they should have given this bar a different name. maybe Dark Chocolate for Beginners. It is a Dark Chocolate bar but with only 54% cacao. It is still more than typical milk chocolate (in the 30s). but it may confuse fans of dark chocolate. This is more of a bridging-the-gap type of a chocolate. For someone coming to this from the off-the-shelf mass-market milk chocolate. this is not as bitter as typical dark chocolate. so if you want to eat healthier chocolate. this may be an option. It is also sweet. sweeter than most of the dark chocolates (60%) I recall trying out. and it does not have the bitter taste.<br /><br />However. for someone coming to this from the 60% and 70% and 80% dark chocolate. this may come as a surprise. as it is sweeter and it doesn't have the high percentage of cocoa one would expect. Newman also has a 70% Super Dark chocolate <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHSQRM>Newman's Own Organics Super Dark (70%) Chocolate Bar. 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> but I haven't tried that so I can't really compare. However. the choice of a name (70% being called Super Dark) is a hint that these are perhaps intended more for the mass-market grocery store consumer. not the dark chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise. the whole chocolate bar (2.25oz or 64 grams) has 330 calories and it provides one-third of the RDA fat calories and two-thirds of the RDA saturated fat calories. There is 0% cholesterol. 0% trans-fat and only traces of sodium (5mg). Also good is 4g of fiber and 3g of protein. but a jumping up and down 28g of sugars. It is candy after all :-) The cocoa is Rainforest Alliance certified.<br /><br />The bar is made in a way that can be broken in six (probably uneven unless you are careful) pieces. so theoretically you can break it into six servings. which significantly lowers the calories and fat intake. More realistically. one-third of the bar is a reasonable compromise for one person per day. bringing it down to 110 calories with 10% RDA fat and 22% RDA saturated fat. (the numbers are based on the standard 2000 calorie diet found in most of the food labels).
42771,B002NHYQAS,A357B3PUHSVQA,Y. R. Wu The will to win is nothing without ...,0/0,1298505600,Smooth. not too sweet.  Very good though a bit simple for hard core chocoholics,Summary: a very good starter gourmet dark chocolate for those who aren't into strong flavors...<br /><br />We eat a disturbing amount of chocolate around our house. whether it's Lindt. Ghiradelli. Sees. Cadbury. Toblerone. Scharffen Berger. Godiva or even Hershey's. we've had it.<br /><br />We tend towards the very dark chocolates. although i do have to say we had some Lindt in the 90% range which was just a bit too sharp.  I'm also a espresso aficionado.<br /><br />This chocolate has a very smooth texture.  It's well tempered and starts out quite firm in the mouth. then melts to a very smooth consistency.  It's fairly sweet for a dark chocolate - not as sweet as a Hershey's special dark. but more than other dark chocolates in this range.  54% cocoa gives a much stronger taste than Milk chocolate and here it still has a very creamy finish with no sharp aftertaste.  Still. I found it simply chocolate without any accompanying flavors you tend to notice in the stronger chocolates.<br /><br />If you like your coffee black or like cappuccinos then this might be for you.  If you drink Turkish coffee or espresso then this probably won't have enough punch for you.
42784,B002NHYQAS,A6X1O3A5C5FX1,SMB,0/0,1298505600,Not impressed.,I consider myself something of a chocolate connoisseur. I love it and have tried many different types and forms of chocolate at quite a few tastings.<br /><br />I had hopes that this chocolate would be divine.  It wasn't.  It tasted waxy and strangely. not all that chocolate'y.  It was also shockingly small after seeing the caloric content -300+ calories in a bar barely the size of my iPhone!<br /><br />Since I work on a system of worth the calories or not when it comes to sweets...I immediately placed this chocolate bar in the not worth the calories category. and that is why I can't recommend this product.  Seek chocolate cravings elsewhere!
42802,B002NHYQAS,A18IZ3RTL9SD4V,K Sprite,0/0,1298419200,Possibly the best dark chocolate ever,Ok. so I am a little biased. I adore the late Paul Newman. his family. his enterprise. his charity. and all of his products. But I also love me some dark chocolate! I take my chocolate tasting very seriously and wouldn't give it high marks just based on sheer good will. This is some seriously good stuff! Even though I love dark chocolate. I am not what one would call a chocoholic. I have restraint. I typically have a bar in my cupboard. then after dinner break off a piece or two. I savor it. then I leave it at that. Tonight I tried a piece of this delicious confection had to eat half the bar all at once. It was SO GOOD! What I love about it is it's creamy consistency. You usually find that in only milk chocolate. whereas dark chocolate usually has a sharp. almost bitter taste to it. You don't get any of that bitter taste in this bar at all - and yet it's a true dark chocolate. How do they do that? There are lots of subtle undertones of flavors. and it makes for an amazing dessert. And of course coming from Paul Newman. it's heaven sent.<br /><br />Bonus too that they took such great care in choosing the best fair-trade organic chocolate. That's a big deal because if you look at most commercial chocolate sources. it makes the diamond industry look tame. This makes Newman's Organic a truly guilt-free delight. Enjoy!
42808,B002NHYQAS,AXP8GO5Q3AXSA,Michael J. Descy,0/0,1298419200,Creamy. Tasty. but Not Too Chocolaty,This chocolate is very creamy and delicious either raw or melted. It is only 54% cacao. which is either very good or not so good. depending on your preferences.<br /><br />My wife and I love dark chocolate. and try to make our chocolate desserts (such as brownies. ganache. mousse. and chocolate buttercream frosting) as chocolaty as possible. This chocolate might not have enough punch for us. compared to the<br />Ghirardelli 60% and 70% cacao (bittersweet) chocolate that we usually buy. This chocolate is not as intensely chocolaty as either of those. and is sweeter and more creamy. I enjoy milk chocolate (which has much less cacao than dark chocolate) more than my wife does. and liked this chocolate more than she did.<br /><br />This is a very good start if you are just getting into dark chocolate. though. or are already sure of what cacao level you prefer.
42824,B002NHYQAS,A1VUN4JU731CBH,I. Peters,0/0,1298419200,Nothing special,Maybe it is because this chocolate only contains 54 % cocoa (vs. let's say the 70 % Lindt) but I found the taste disappointing. This might be premium chocolate. and it might be organic and Rainforest Alliance-certified. But the flavor still is surprisingly bland and cheap - a tad too sweet and creamy. with a bit of a waxy texture in too thick a bar. This is just a run-of-the-mill dark chocolate and nothing to entice the palate with.
42829,B002NHYQAS,A9KLAL1CXZ0W5,E. Barron alphabetjungle,0/0,1298419200,This is what I like in a chocolate bar,This dark chocolate bar is 54% cacao. with a solid chocolate taste--not overly sweet as some bars are. but not at all bitter. The chocolate melts nicely in the mouth without the waxy texture that some cheaper bars have. While the nutrition label lists this bar as one serving. for me it is two generous servings at 2.25 ounces of flavor. It is also 330 calories (200 from fat) which also makes me want to split it into at least 2 servings or share with a friend. It is easily broken into six substantial squares. so that makes sharing easy. Half a bar is a very satisfying treat. If the price is not too hefty. this is a bar worthy of satifying a serious chocolate craving.
42830,B002NHYQAS,AEL6CQNQXONBX,Cute Chihuahua,0/0,1298332800,Smooth and rich dark chocolate. tastes great. worth trying,I love all types of chocolate but especially dark chocolate. I would consider this to be one of the best dark chocolate bars that I have tried so far. It is very smooth and rich without a bitter aftertaste. These bars are 2.25 oz. and each has 330 calories. For the size of the bar I would consider that 330 well spent calories. The size is just enough to satisfy you without being too large and excessive.<br /><br />These chocolate bars are 100% organic. I don't buy a lot of organic products but it is nice to know that this product is 100% natural.  Each bar contains 54% cocoa which is dark but not the darkest that I have tried. My personal opinion is the darker the chocolate the better it tastes for the most part. These are definitely worth trying.
42845,B002NHYQAS,A4IL0CLL27Q33,D. Brennan,3/5,1298505600,Disappointing on a number of levels,My wife and I independently taste-tested this product. My wife is a regular consumer of dark chocolates while I tend to prefer milk chocolate. and/or chocolates with fillings. After trying it out. we both decided that we would not purchase this product in the future. though for different reasons. Here are our independent reviews:<br /><br />My wife: I am confused by the labeling of this product. It is called a 'dark chocolate' but has a 54% cacao content. Most dark chocolates that I buy have upwards of 65% - 75% cacao. When I first opened the package. I noticed a smoky aroma. I eat a lot of dark chocolate. including raw chocolate. but I never noticed such a smoky aroma before and found it pleasant. My first bite was disappointing. It is a bit too sweet for me. and is certainly significantly sweeter than the dark chocolates that I buy. It is smooth. which I like. While I appreciate the fact that Newman's own is producing an organic. minimally processed. chocolate I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Me: From my first bite I knew that this chocolate was not for me. It had a distinctly waxy feel that I usually associate with inferior chocolates - this was an immediate turnoff. There was absolutely nothing distinctive about this chocolate - no fruity notes. no particular bitterness. nothing that sticks out. While this chocolate is better than a lot of what constitutes the mass market. I cannot recommend it.
42867,B002NHYQAS,A25WJCAP606YMP,ESVK SVK,1/2,1298505600,Yummy!,The dark chocolate is not too sweet and not to bitter.  Delicious and organic.  What's more to say?
42880,B002NHYQAS,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,Beth Cholette doctor_beth,1/2,1298332800,Smooth organic chocolate with a semi-sweet taste,I love dark chocolate. so I was excited to try this Newman's Own Dark Chocolate bar.  First. I was impressed that the bar. which is smaller than other specialty chocolate bars but still a generous six squares. is just a single serving size.  At 330 calories. 22 grams of fat. and 28 grams of sugar. it is still an indulgent treat. but if you choose to share the bar (as I did). you can satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling too guilty about it.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the taste of this bar as well; I found the chocolate to be rich and smooth.  At 54% cocoa. it is definitely not as dark as many other dark chocolate offerings out there--in fact. I found the taste to be a bit sweeter. more reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate than true dark chocolate.  Although this was fine by me. some dark chocolate lovers may be disappointed.  So. unless you need your dark chocolate to be of the extra-dark variety. I would definitely recommend this product.
42891,B002NHYQAS,A10H24TDLK2VDP,William Jens Jensen,2/4,1298505600,Couldn't be better,Wow! As with virtually all Newman's Own products. this is the best. I've tried just about every brand. including a number of organic chocolates. and this beats them all. Naturally. such and assessment is subjective. but I'd suggest that in a blind tasting (i.e.. without the suggestion of a brand name). Newman's Own chocolate would always be at or near the top of every list. Do yourself a favor and get some--it's good for you. too! You won't regret it.
42915,B002NHYQAS,A1D2FXEWRIV1YV,Anne Masterson,0/1,1299801600,Somewhat chalky with a bit of an after taste.,I love what Newman's is doing and I applaud their products.  I must confess that I am not a big lover of dark chocolate and prefer milk.  This particular bar tasted chalky. like maybe it had been available for a while (which. since it was free. may have been the case).  It also had an unpleasant after taste.  I am not sure if Newman's has  a milk chocolate bar. but if it does. I will get one to add the comparison to my review.
42918,B002NHYQAS,A1ZZR25X0CNOJX,slim 57psalm,0/1,1298505600,OMGosh!  A chocoholic's dream!,I have had a lot of chocolate in my life time. from all over the world. I've have the pralines in Belgium. the smooth satiny rich chocolate of Switzerland (which I consider the best) and spent some time in France trying their orange and chocolate combinations. I do love American chocolate products also! I prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate. unless in Switzerland where the milk is the most creamiest (and unpasteurized) I have ever had the joy of trying.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organic chocolate bars rival that of my European favorites.  It has just the right amount of dark chocolate flavor (54% dark) without being too bitter.  It has a solid texture that quickly becomes creamy as it melts in your mouth. The sweetness is not overwhelming. and this definitely falls into the dark chocolate lover's category.<br /><br />I feared that organic chocolate would not taste good. since I am not into organic this and that.  I hated the Carob years when everyone tried to convince me that Carob tasted just as good as chocolate. though it wasn't even really close!  This chocolate is very very good.<br /><br />I don't eat chocolate for my health. of course (unless mental health counts) and this stuff is high on the calories (330 per bar. or 64 grams. or 2.25 ounces.) compared to another brand's special dark chocolate bar. which is 180 calories per 41 grams.<br /><br />The choco-holic in your life (and you know there is one) will find this to be a very delicious treat! The gold foil wrapper inside lets you know you are buying something special!<br />Highly recommended if you like dark chocolate!
42949,B002NHYQAS,A3R7RE5O61M112,@homemom,0/0,1300233600,all around good. but average chocolate bar,I'd suspect most people who try this will like it. at least enough to finish a bar. I prefer dark chocolate. typically with a higher % rating then this has but hey chocolate is chocolate so I wasn't going to turn down trying it. It reminded me far more of a bittersweet (think chocolate chip) then of my typical dark chocolate bars. It wasn't bad by any means but it didn't stand out as amazing either. It's obviously worlds above your typical candy isle bar but I wouldn't pick it out when compared to other organic dark chocolate options at a specialty market. For those interested in moving into dark chocolate for health benefits this might be a good transition bar into those with a higher % if you're used to milk chocolates.
42956,B002NHYQAS,A1CHKAWX7FAOM4,L. Kirk Crabseye,0/0,1299715200,Pretty good taste. even better fringe benefits,Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is a pretty good chocolate bar that has more going for it than just taste. First. it's USDA certified organic. I try to use organic products as much as possible. particularly on less costly products and those where organic matters. Second. the product is Rainforest Alliance Certified cacao. So the cacao is produced using sustainable growing techniques. These are the things about the product that I like best. And sometimes. it's these factors that make the difference between buying product A or B.<br /><br />As far as the taste ... well. it is not the best chocolate bar I have ever tried. nor is it the worst. First. the bar is about 7 mm thick ... moderately chunky as bars go. There is a classy-looking N emblem embossed in each piece. The nutritional panel says that one bar is a serving. but that one serving is going to provide about 330 calories ... actually 1/3 of a bar is a serving for me. The chocolate is not very melty. This is more common in higher cacao content chocolate bars; Newman's Own bar is about 54% cacao. so I was a little surprised. The bar was also a little sweeter than I expected. The chocolate was not unpleasant. but it just seemed to lack a smack your face slap of chocolate flavor that you expect in good dark chocolate.<br /><br />So. bottom line time: Newman's own is a decent but unremarkable chocolate bar. It's organic and Rainforest-friendly. and earns the product bonus points in my book.
42965,B002NHYQAS,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,W. Oliver,0/0,1299542400,Excellent with a few reservations,Smooth and delicious. this chocolate bar is great for baking or good just on its own. Although dark chocolate. it is sweeter than most and doesn't have a noticeable bitter aftertaste (similar to milk chocolate). At 54% chocolate. it falls below a lot of other quality chocolates. Still. quite delicious. The small size is a disappointment.
42991,B002NHYQAS,A1X2LENOF84LCQ,D D,0/0,1298937600,good dark chocolate,If you like dark chocolate this is good. but I find it no better than any other dark chocolate so I would go more with price. This is organic though so it does command a higher price. I prefer organics but I also have to watch the budget too. If you have the extra money. you won't go wrong buying this.
42993,B002NHYQAS,A7JGEKN140F4S,Keith kc31824,0/0,1298937600,Just right...,I like a little taste of dark chocolate as a sweet treat. that isn't quite as unhealthful as. say. a Hershey's bar... Newman's gets the balance just right for my taste.  It's dark not milk chocolate which I gather is somewhat better for you.  But its not disgustingly bitter tasting to the point that you don't feel like you're eating chocolate at all like some dark chocolates taste -- it still tastes pretty much like a good old chocolate bar (maybe slightly more dark / bitter).
43014,B002NHYQAS,A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,Boilermate,0/0,1298678400,Decent Premium Chocolate But A Bit Pricy,Ever since I saw on TV how much work the cocoa farmers have to do to get their product into the sack and to market I have tried to purchase chocolate that treats the farmers more fairly. Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa used in Newman's Own Organics products meets this requirement.<br /><br />As for this product. 54% cocoa is a nice step up for people who normally do not like dark chocolate. While it may be a bit tame for those who like really dark chocolate. I thought it was quite good. It has a nice smooth texture that didn't have the waxy feel of standard store-bought chocolate. It melted smoothly without any off flavors or nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The price is a bit steep even for premium chocolate. Given a choice. I will stick to Divine (certified Fair Trade) for the few times I give into the chocolate urge.
43030,B002TSA90C,AA98XEPL62IKC,Roland VerusEx,2/4,1282608000,Nice but crazy price,I'll stick with the $3 ones at Walmart that look the same but have different brand names on them
43041,B0036VLYWI,A26QFZ9JNOB08X,Cassie,0/0,1349827200,Best and Healthiest Tortilla Chips,I love these tortilla chips.  I am hypoglycemic and it is difficult to find foods that meet the criteria of my diet.  These not only meet the criteria. but they taste great and are healthy with all the of various grains.  I would recommend these to everyone!
43044,B0017OE57W,A35CHX7F3A4ONQ,lemonsweet,0/0,1327449600,Love this stuff!,Over 25 years ago (I was very young). my mom found a hot blueberry beverage drink mix at a discount store.  I loved it. but we could never find it again. I recently tried to find out what it was so that I could find something similar. and this is it!  It is lovely to drink in the evening and a nice change from the herbal teas I usually drink.
43048,B004P0SRSS,A29YA5RMQ382K7,Deb R,1/1,1349136000,Just Crumbs,Ordered paprika pringle potato chips.What I received was 2 cans of potato crumbs. The cans were in a cardboard box with out any packing material. Before I opened the box that it would be crumbs.That would have been OK if they weren't stale. These were as a surprise for my daughter. She had them when she was in Europe and raved about them. These she didn't rave about. What a disappointment!

43118,B003LJ95EE,ALFYZ5EEXV5GH,Westchester,0/0,1338249600,Nice taste and texture,The taste is what I expected - earthy grain. somewhat nutty. Goes well with many different vegetables and meats. Quality looks about as good as it gets.
43139,B003O7DVRA,AWJXWD0EMKIUV,T. B. H. The Bargain Hunter,0/0,1337472000,Good to keep on hand,It's not as good as fresh milk. to me. but it's a good staple to have on hand. It tastes like VHT or shelf-stable milk. if you've ever had that. Similar to evaporated milk. but thinner. of course.
43145,B0014AUA1O,A1RXGXAIGKM5LD,Jessica Doty,1/1,1199577600,Great Tea,The tea was great!  And was the only thing that took care of All Day sickness by the third trimester.<br /><br />The only bad thing about it was the company I bought it from.  They charged $17.00 shipping for two boxes of this tea.  Next time I'll be ordering this from someone else.
43152,B0017U24LA,A39MNF3SPZOJ33,James Purdy Jim Purdy,3/3,1337212800,Awesomely good!,This flavor is awesomely good. in my opinion. I recently ordered 5 different varieties of Dr. McDougall's soups. and this flavor quickly became my favorite. I just ordered several more 6-packs of the lentil couscous soup.<br /><br />I was looking for high fiber. and this soup has lots of fiber. My stomach is pretty finicky. but the only problem this product caused me was a craving for more.<br /><br />Some people complained about it not having enough salt. but the label says lower sodium. for goodness sakes! Duh! Anyway.I would have preferred even less sodium. For me. the flavor is great!
43155,B0017U24LA,A2WVC9H1ZQU6P5,charmattack,2/2,1298851200,Disappointed,I have really enjoyed other Dr. McDougall products. but not this one. It was really bland and needs to be cooked longer than on the directions. I gave it 2 tries. but couldn't finish either.
43161,B0017U24LA,A2B2RMZYM3MYYL,Syed H. Waqif,1/1,1334707200,Lentil and Couscous,As said less salt. I just addded some salt. Very good product.Ok. this product is good yummy and fresh in the package. Delivery time was good too. Price is excellent too. Thank you.
43174,B0017U24LA,A11YOTONCPRQ9S,SH,1/1,1259884800,Very good,This is one of my favorites from this company.  It's low-calorie and tasty.  It feels like I actually ate something more than just soup.  The package is a bit smaller than some of the other varieties. probably to keep the calories low.
43184,B0017U24LA,A1TZMHC97YEPKE,Kevin Cimring,0/0,1323820800,Hits the spot,I was initially skeptical of this type of packaged soup. but was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it taste good. but the big deal with this McDougall soup is that it has minimal fat content (there are no added oils). and it has reasonably low sodium content which is rare in pre-packaged soups. So all in all. it's a great package that is worth having as an easy & healthy snack/meal on the go or part of your lunch at work.  It also goes well as a gravy/sauce over brown rice. Really good and worth a try.
43199,B003CJN0OO,AWG8T2W3MVC6G,Kiss Me Kate,1/1,1297641600,Best Coffee Ever Made,This is the best coffee on the planet. it truly is.  Super smooth. really nice deep taste.  I gave it to an uncle as a gift and he says its the only coffee he's ever had that actually tastes better without any cream & sugar.  Awesome product. highly recommended.
43205,B003CJN0OO,A1ONT5BHMPV111,The South Face,0/0,1336089600,Can't be without it!,This is my favorite coffee to make at home. It is great in a drip machine. a Keurig. a French press. etc... The taste is full and rich without being bitter. burnt. or too strong. It almost has a slight chocolately flavor to it. Even the beans make the whole house smell good when I put them in the grinder. I have been on auto delivery for years and the bags are always fresh and come within two or three days of shipment. It does take a few tries to perfect your cup of coffee. not too much. not too little. etc... but once you do and you can duplicate it you won't be sorry.
43213,B003CJN0OO,A5ATBP02NUZJB,Steph2003x,0/0,1309737600,Ahh... the flavor!,First off. I'm not a huge coffee drinker. maybe one or two cups a month. and I only drink it when it's GOOD coffee. This stuff is awesome. Not bitter at all. My husband is the coffee drinker in our house and always says that when I make his coffee it's better... that's because I make this when I make his coffee. and he just puts a breakfast blend k-cup in the Keurig. Anyway. I use my Magic Bullet to grind enough of this for about a week. then I reuse some of the old k-cups that I have cleaned out. Usually. about 1.5 tbsp of coffe or a little more will fit into the k-cup. I found some great little plastic lids here on Amazon that snap right on and Viola! Awesome single-cup coffee. which is MUCH cheaper than shelling out $11 for a box of 18 k-cups! I actually use the same coffee grounds twice to get a bigger cup of coffee. Anyway. I hope this helps. This is great coffee. and it's very smooth. Definitely worth trying.
43218,B003CJN0OO,A2YJT3JKYSQ5GN,Kevin VanAntwerp,0/1,1315526400,Disappointed,We were told by a relative this was the best coffee they had had.We love our morning coffee and we use a Jura compressa machine to make it. We were not pleased with the taste of this coffee even compared to local store brands. Still better than instant coffee.
43242,B008CQJBI6,AC2HT6SPODOGH,Randy0002,0/0,1342915200,Great spices,I've had their sauces before. which I'd highly recommend. and their spices/rubs didn't disappoint!  Great flavors on anything you're cooking.

Snyder,9/10,1324684800,Spreadable. with a Good Roasted Flavor,I don't do unsweetened. unsalted. peanut butter made from 100% peanuts. but I do like my peanut butter spread to be all-natural without high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils.  This spread fits the bill. with a better flavor than it's Jif or Skippy counterparts.

Santos Author of &34;The Hopeless Christ...,0/0,1298160000,Great,Bought it as a gift for a friend who loves Starburst. she loved it and they come in packages or bars so she was able to share a few with her friends without them taking the whole thing. About 3 months later and she still has a few left.
43322,B001R1E250,A3DUC6RIYQDSAV,m,12/13,1277424000,excellent for arthritis,This product mixed with mineral water is a tasty drink. but it also relieves my arthritis symptoms caused by taking Femara.

43371,B0002DHNY6,ACNOKEZBIF2G1,Sherry,0/0,1331683200,Great dog treats!,Our 2 little dogs really like these treats and wait anxiously each morning for them. Often bring empty kongs and drop at my feet for more! It's hard to find the small size in local stores. so it's great to be able to order them on line.
43375,B0045VV7IY,AJ7Y0S4YC6IFQ,Brian Aldridge,14/14,1318464000,It's good. but probably only worth like twenty thousand,I bought this for $45.000 or thereabouts.  It was definitely delicious. but after finishing it in 15 minutes I wanted a little more bang for my buck.  $20K would have been a better price point.
43390,B004AG6HDO,A2F48MC03EGLPA,armybrat,0/0,1293235200,french mustard,incredible flavor !Nothing like our american mstard. It has so many flavors and the texture is creamy~  It almost a tiny meal in itslef!  It tickles your tongue with so many tastes. Our host family in France had it in their home and after finishing the one I broght back I had to have another one!
43396,B0000DJDHK,A3AIXTN4QGTCSF,Zoncrow,9/11,1342396800,Keep a chaser handy...,I love cookies because I'm a fatty.<br /><br />These are not cookies though. they are the cookie version of sin. Ever held sin in tangible form? Well if not these cookies will do the job! If cookies had a religion. these would be their anti-christ. Hitler could not make a cookie that tasted this bad and look at his cooking attempts. These things taste like you grabbed the shells of peanuts from the floor of a 1930's stadium and shoved them in your mouth with the intent of assaulting your taste buds. Have you ever wanted to assault yours or your friends taste buds? Behold the compact way of doing so! Please keep in mind that a chaser of some type of liquid is a necessity when attempting to eat these. I unfortunately did not have any present and had to man up while trying to over come these dastardly doom disks. Speaking of which. after eating one of these I was compelled to the bathroom by some satanic calling from my belly. Upon making it there I vomited profusely. For the first time in my life. the taste of vomit was welcomed. On that note. these should never be allowed near anyone whom ever was or is bulimic or anorexic as it will give them ever more incentive to vomit.<br /><br />Did you know if you threw these out the window of your car you'd be ticketed for littering? Why? Due to the simple fact that they lack a trait know as biodegradable. Bacterial could not even be bothered to touch these. I could go on and on about how bad these are. but alas I have to finish taking care of these cookies.<br /><br />I'm going to take these and have the bag. with the remainder of the cookies. laminated to seal them in forever. After doing so. I will be shipping these to NATO with the intent of having these cookies be banned from war. I will edit this post upon receiving an update from NATO about these cookies.<br /><br />Little known fact. these cookies were first made in 1986. Know what else happed in 1986? The Chernobyl disaster...yeah think about it.
43420,B003UBFYK2,A2LDUJUY9B0RY1,ksomji,1/2,1323475200,tooo little for too much,It was very small according to her.<br />not really worth the 19 bucks.<br />but good to know there is still someone selling these!!
43449,B001EQ4P2I,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,jjceo,0/0,1339027200,Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!,These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just. WOW. bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein. 5 grams of carbohydrates. 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium. vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body. heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!
43455,B001EQ4P2I,A2N2X7L7LB3S6X,Chris,0/0,1337558400,Great Flavor....,I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors. Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me. these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.
43457,B001EQ4P2I,A2N2X7L7LB3S6X,Chris,0/0,1337299200,Great flavor,I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the bold flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.
43480,B001EQ4P2I,A2EMM9HWOSY2Q5,Jemmie Wang,0/0,1318550400,It's like crack. without the cocaine base,I don't know what they put in these things. but whatever it is it's addictive. The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of I'm going to eat this entire can RFN.<br /><br />The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores. but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants. but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more.
43486,B001EQ4P2I,A3JG2RKIWRGIJF,L. Meloy,0/0,1307145600,Healthy. satisfying snack on the go,While trying to cut back on carbs. and add more protein to my diet. I discovered this wonderful tasty snack.  At 260 calories. even this 1.5 oz pack is too much for a snack. but I divide the packs in half again and have a healthy snack that helps satisfy my hunger in the late afternoon.  They're also good as a breakfast on the run. The wasabi adds a wonderful punch-love them!
43499,B001EQ4P2I,A3QN6CZK31WU7P,Alexalisbeth,0/0,1287705600,Zesty Deliciousness in a Can,I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.5oz package daily with lunch. but buying them in bulk makes so much more sense.  Yum!  The empty cans are good for storing loose hardware and small things around the house.

43532,B001EQ4P2I,AI8Z1GP75O9J4,Phyllis J. Kirk sttchurchlady,0/3,1237161600,Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds,The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better. but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK
43543,B001EQ4P2I,A1N5FSCYN4796F,"Philip R. Heath Gadgets, Music, & Books",3/3,1251244800,A Great Spicy. Healthy Snack!!,Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat. and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point. the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain. unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy. give these a try.
43544,B001EQ4P2I,A25PM9JGHPU8EI,Wes,3/3,1245196800,My mouth is watering while writing this review,I just tried these for the first time last night...and wow. what a product! The lime and chili combination for these almonds is AMAZING. The flavor is INTENSE. powerful and oh. so delicious!! I am going to buy a bunch more of these to snack on. and I have to say. I will be snacking on THESE almonds for a long time to come. And seriously - I'm salivating while I write this!! I'm going to go eat some right now!
43560,B001EQ4P2I,A1C46Y4XMS31EX,Troy Minor,2/2,1298332800,Addictive!,I love wasabi....and these almonds are AWESOME!  They taste better than any other flavor enhanced almonds on the market.

They make a great snack and a great substitute for chips with a sandwich.  They are a little tart and a little sweet. YUMMY!
43614,B001EQ4P2I,A2AS281JRDBLTQ,Daniel,0/0,1343952000,Great Keto or Low-carb snack,A great flavor and 4g net carbs. 2g sugars. Nearly guilt-free snacking and an awesome amount of fat. These aren't the ideal nut for low-carb and/or keto diets. macadamias are probably closer. but these are much more widely available and the flavors make it easier to snack reasonably.
43618,B001EQ4P2I,A2E9CDS1YDQS0P,Paul,0/0,1342137600,tasty,These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me.

43644,B000P0SCKK,A1AK19M428HCVY,Jessica S.,0/0,1343433600,Super Delicious,I bought this as a gift for someone who likes pineapple. I'm not a huge fan. but tried a piece. It is soooo good. Tastes just like pineapple. plus is soft and chewy. not like hard licorice at all. Highly recommend this product.

This candy is the best I have ever tasted. my last order was my third (3rd). it is realy good and may be habit forming to your tast buds.<br /><br />There are several items to choose from. which can be confusing. The best value is the 4-16oz tubs.4 lbs total vs the 1.5 pound package. they are both the same price. I found this to be wrong. on the part of Amazon to allow this to happen. I did not send the 1.5 lbs bag back. it wasn't worth my time. and I do like the candy...<br /><br />I live in Gainesville FL. not Zoe KY.
43672,B0049ZCF9G,A7EK88GF8N40F,Nicole S. Urdang,1/1,1328745600,A great little snack,At first. I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them. regardless.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this company's products. and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ (using the smallest amount of pesticides possible).  I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line. especially the Habanero. is also excellent. as are the dark chocolate variety.
43680,B0049ZCF9G,A3GV9YG4LWSDKN,AllieD204,0/0,1348185600,Like Snickerdoodle cookies!,I love these almonds!!  They taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie. but make for a much healthier snack!  One of my favorites of the Blue Diamond Oven Roasted varieties.  Buying them in a 6-pack is more cost-effective for me. especially now that I can't find them in my grocery store. I wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors. but for now I'll stick with the 6 container pack.
43687,B0049ZCF9G,A1IKOG44PHFNYS,Brigitte Hoch,0/0,1342051200,Should almost be labelled a BOLD flavor,Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However. I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top dessert almonds when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold. sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
43694,B0049ZCF9G,A18Z7ICRLVHBBP,Catherine S.,0/0,1332547200,Yummy in my Tummy :),I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago. as I often find myself jonesing for junk food. and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around. I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition. and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more. but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters. as I don't like producing so much waste. but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk. and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream. chocolate chips. and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you. but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E. 15% Phosphorus. 20% Magnesium. 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

43717,B0049ZCF9G,A2D1FG0PPEWPCG,S. McDonough Cheaper is Better,1/2,1269561600,Best Tasting Almonds,Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months
43720,B0049ZCF9G,A1SLAL64ORLT41,Bonnie Muffin,0/1,1314576000,Cinnamon nom nom noms,These taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch. but with the nutritional composition of almonds. They're pretty mind blowing. Don't be afraid of buying a 6-pack; you'll need it.

43768,B001EQ5JLE,A8NIMAMG3B0D0,C. Schindler,0/0,1304899200,pg tips black tea,This is good tea. but I miss my Twinnings flavors.  The only problem I have with this tea is that it seems to upset my stomach after I drink a few.  I don't know why. but it only happens after I have had two or three cups. I like the fact that the tagless bags float in the cup instead of sinking.  This elemenats having to stir the tea.

For the price I payed. this tea is a great deal. I'm not 100 percent sure what way I like the tea prepared. I made three cups already and each one tasted a bit different from the last. depending on how long I left the tea pyramid in the cup. The only thing is that I may have purchased 3 orders instead of 2 orders if I knew that it would expire in February of 2012.
43793,B001EQ5JLE,A1AGYOFQX4YZGT,J. Murphy somebody's mum,0/0,1282262400,The best tea,I have purchased this tea before and find it far superior to other brands I've tried. I try to bring some back when I visit England and can purchase it in a local store but at a much higher price than Amazon. The prices offered can't be beat. It makes a very good full bodied cup of tea which goes well with milk and sugar.

43818,B001EQ5JLE,AEO1L073HMSPQ,Marshall's Sauces Marshall,1/2,1300924800,EXCELLENT PRODUCT - I DRINK IT EVERYDAY,I love PG Tips. I've been drinking it since I was in my early teens.  I drank it all the time I lived in England and I drink it everyday in NW Ohio.  Amazon.com has the best price I've been able to find anywhere - with free shipping when you buy over $25.00 worth.  I subscribe to Amazon.com's Subscription Purchasing.
43826,B001EQ5JLE,A34EGKN2KDX08N,Michael - the Tea Lover,88/95,1193011200,Briton's 1 Tea - PG Tips,The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand. and perhaps after you try it; it will be your 1 choice. too! (By the way. the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.)<br /><br />PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home's standard tea. There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name Pre-Gest-Tee suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten. but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of PG - and the company added tips (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant. the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud). which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas. PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused. Additionally. in my opinion. PG Tips blends only two blends. rather than blending a wide assortment. thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two. and even less expensive in the higher volumes. PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too. and that's good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea. Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea. and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water). while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is Why this is?<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one's health. and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea). especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa. and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus. I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!
43833,B001EQ5JLE,A1TBHZWFFZ318S,Duane Healing,5/5,1188691200,Great everyday tea,This is a great everyday tea. It produces a very consistent cup that is rich and flavorful without getting harsh. I drink quite a bit of very high quality loose-leaf tea also. but for quality and convenience PG Tips can't be beat.

43869,B001EQ5JLE,A1WLKU4YWTQ7IE,Judith Orlopp,2/2,1241481600,Excellent!,The tea arrived promptly and is an excellent value.  I was paying the same price for one box at my local British store - and this is a two package offer.<br />I'm very pleased.
43874,B001EQ5JLE,A3CLT4QS2N9NQ7,R. Carey,2/2,1228176000,Excellent black tea at a great price,I recently started drinking PG Tips when I found it in the tea/coffee cabinet at the home of the family that I work for. They know I make tea for myself nearly everyday. so they are kind enough to keep tea in stock for me.  Being a young American. I had never heard of PG Tips until now. so I am sad that I have been in the dark for so long. The taste and texture of this tea is absolutely fabulous. I brew it for 2 minutes and it makes a perfect cup without any bitterness. but with a bold smooth flavor. I also add a splash of milk and a bit of sugar or honey... whatever is on hand. I am glad this is becoming widely available in the States and I can see this replacing my regular morning cup of Twinings. I can see why this is the 1 tea in the UK.
43887,B001EQ5JLE,A3HOECCD0EW96F,telescop$1,1/1,1297468800,English tea at it's best,My friends and I have found that PG TIPS tea has a very enjoyable taste and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves that TRUE english tea taste.

43911,B001EQ5JLE,A1IYXLFKWAWJP,J. Decker,3/4,1258243200,PG Tips is great tea,PG Tips is my favorite tea.  Amazon's was fresh and reasonably priced and arrived quickly.
43924,B001EQ5JLE,A4PYEHP1I855T,Mugsy,0/0,1347494400,PG Tips Quarterly Order.,The PG Tips arrived in good order. I have found that I'm using more of the product and would like to receive the same order more frequently than quarterly. How do I change my order frequency? Excellent service otherwise thank you.
43931,B001EQ5JLE,A3LDHTZQQXXKS3,I. Clements,0/0,1336262400,PG Tips. warms the heart of any ex-Brit,There really isn't much I can say.  If you've had PG Tips you know the difference.  If you haven't you don't know what your missing.<br /><br />I'm from the UK originally and for years in the States I drank Lipton as it was the only brand I could readily find.  But along came Amazon and restored my access to my favorite tea.<br /><br />If you're used to drinking Lipton. PG TIps has a stronger flavor and if you brew it real strong it can get bitter on you.  However I used to use 2 Lipton bags to get the strength I like and just one PG Tips bag does the job nicely.<br /><br />If you're not sold. wait until it goes on sale or special and at least try one box.  Its particularly good if you brew it in a proper ceramic or china teapot rather than making it directly in a cup.<br /><br />Actually that is one thing to note.  These tea bags don't have little strings so make sure you've got something handy to fish them out with.<br /><br />From an Eco-friendly perspective I also like the fact that you only have the tea bags and the main box they come in.  Only the plastic shrink wrap is not recyclable.  If you drink a lot of tea using individually wrapped tea bags you are going to be generating a lot of unnecessary waste.  Particularly for those teas in plastic envelopes.  At least in Lipton's favor they do use paper wrappers you can recycle.
43935,B001EQ5JLE,A1NETELF6CJ7DB,m20e3087,0/0,1334620800,Excelent,I took a chance not knowing about the exp date. but got mine with exp date. Fall 2013. Can't beat amazon price!!
43939,B004H4PBPO,AM24B24LS9II,Brian J. Bernstein,2/2,1316304000,Something different,You have ginger ale made from ginger. this is the same idea except made from celery. It isn't quite ginger ale. it isn't quite 7-up / Sprite. it is something in between. It might be a little odd the first time you have it. but it is addictive once you've acquired the taste! Too bad they don't make the diet version anymore. it was one of the few where it tasted the same as the regular.
43941,B004RBG322,AO667WXFUP03V,Spartie Girl,0/0,1334275200,Spartan Energy Drink,I was drawn in by the Spartan graphics. but.I<br />like this product much better than the more well known competitors.<br />No overpowering sweettart smell or taste.<br />Good balance of sweet and sour.

43954,B0072M7X0O,A3RO2SYZ3JCG6Z,T. Bush,0/0,1334880000,Delicious,Great honey flavor with a subtle hint of added flavor. Used these as baby shower favors. Would definitely purchase again.
43968,B001M09BTS,A1UT0HSV524V1O,emily27055,1/1,1330473600,Yummy,I really enjoy this oatmeal.  I love the taste and texture.  And I love the fact that it has less sugars. more fiber and the good carbs.  If I eat a bowl around 9:00 a.m.. I'm not hungry until late in the afternoon. around 2:00. so it fills me up and keeps me going for awhile.  I was curious to see others' posts about how they dislike the taste.  I think it's delicious. particularly for a low-sugar product!
44001,B0031U9VI8,A2YLRKBQ7VZ6N,C. Brown,6/18,1284768000,DO THE MATH: $5.70 each!!! Can YOU afford this?,Be sure you understand they are asking you to give them about $40 for only **7** squeezies. That makes them nearly $6 each!!!! For fruit sauce??? There are SEVERAL other brands which offer the same thing--pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats--and they are selling for around $35 for ***24***packages of squeezies. See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good. I've tried them. In fact. the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting. in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a P. second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice. but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95. Don't encourage them.
44021,B0031U9VI8,A2IY19P263XVUR,DumpTruckDaddy DumpTruckDaddy,2/2,1300924800,Great Anytime Baby. Toddler. Kid Snack,Absolutely love Ella's Kitchen pouches.  The sweet potato. pumpkin. apples and blueberry one is my 12mo son's favorite. although my 5yo loves it as well.  I wish I had discovered them sooner.  Squeeze into a bowl for spoon feeding or let your little one drink directly from the pouch.  They're convenient and healthy - highly recommend!
44028,B0031U9VI8,A23PCF6OQ8EOME,CourtneyinSF,1/1,1323561600,Yuck yuck yuck,I LOVE Ella's pouches and my son does too. but the look of horror on his face when he first tried this flavor was hilarious. You'd have thought I tried to feed him poison.  Curious to know what flavor could have produced such a strong response from him. I tried the pouch myself.  EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWE!!!!!  I've never tasted anything so vial in my life.  Had we not been out in public at the time I would have spit it out on the floor.  Instead I forced myself to swallow. threw the package away immediately. and apologized profusely to my son for trying to make him eat it.  I shudder just thinking about that one awful bite I had to endure.  Blech.
44048,B0031U9VI8,AH2D50XVHS58K,veroben,0/0,1334620800,Great product,Organic food pouches are wonderful. They are easy to carry and to eat (children can manipulate them on their own as soon as they can hold things with both hands). My child enjoyed Ella's kitchen pouches a lot till she was almost 18 months old.  She seemd to like apples+bananas the best.
44061,B0031U9VI8,A3KG2JE0QVJKOV,Kristina kmke,0/0,1325116800,Good food,My 7 month old son likes this. We tried this after first doing peaches and bananas separately. and he likes them together too.

I love that there really isn't a lot of sugar and that they have so many truly YUMMY flavors - we've probably been using them since he was about 12 months old - only wish I had known about them even sooner!
44117,B0007NOWMM,A1NKKF4W2LHF6M,Caren H,4/4,1152748800,For Vanilla lovers,My husband actually did not like this flavor. but he isn't that big into Vanilla.  However. my in-laws raved!  They may actually buy a Senseo based on trying ours.  They didn't want to drink all of our coffee. but we said go ahead since my husband didn't like it.  They must have had 3 cups each of this coffee. it was like they couldn't get enough.  I suggest that you actually try any Senseo flavor by buying one pack at the store first to see if you like the flavor.  If you do. come back to Amazon and order in bulk to save you money.  $3.84 at Walmart for a package of 10 pods = .38 each.  Here it is only .25 a cup of coffee at the current price.

The headache were more than I could handle so I went to coffee for my caffenine fix and now thanks to french vanilla I am a drinker for LIFE.
44152,B0007NOWMM,A3HIB6FDBL6BR3,PFC,0/0,1303084800,Senseo Paris French Vanilla,I order this flavor regularly.  It is one of my favorites.  If you like the other Senseo pods and flavored coffee. then you will like this one too.  It is smooth. not a strong flavor.

The price was less than our store here. nothing damaged and shipping was fast AND free. Quite the deal when it's an item I have to purchase frequently.
44202,B00113HA3A,A2ZSC81MXLBELX,L. Shirley Laurie's Boomer Views,10/12,1290988800,Nice Change Of Pace and Super Antioxidants,To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant.or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee. coffee. and more coffee.<br /><br />However.hearing so much about the benefits of green tea.I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck. maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green. various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG>Good Earth Tea Green Tea. Lemongrass. 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise. so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated. but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea.Orange Oil.Green Tea Extract.Natural Flavors.Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java. but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe.eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie
44204,B00113HA3A,AHJYC27FSYS5X,Joyful Body Mind Spirit,5/6,1247529600,Very. very good,This is one of the best bagged green teas I have ever tried. and I have tried quite a few.

Kim,0/0,1306540800,Has room for changes if the taste isn't for you,All you have to add are eggs and water to make this quick mix. so it's very hard to get this wrong. Each box is enough to bake a cupcake/muffin tin or a 8x8x2 pan.<br /><br />Tastewise. this is definitely much more traditional than I am used to. Most cornbreads I've had are very sweet and slightly moist--even other spicy blue cornbreads I've had. This was not something I achieved the first time trying this at even the lowest bake time. My brother described it akin to a tortilla chip. Ouch.<br /><br />Additional sugar and butter and lowering the baking temperature has alleviated this quite a bit. but I will probably continue to make some changes to the mix.<br /><br />Lastly. this mix is indeed quite spicy. and I normally handle spicy foods very well. As a product itself it is not overwhelmingly spicy. but this definitely has a little bit more kick than I was expecting. I will be experimenting whether this can be changed as well and will update my review accordingly.<br /><br />My rating of 4 stars goes mostly for ease of using the mix. Rating would probably be lower if my taste preferences were of higher weight. but this is what happens when everything is already in the mix!
44258,B0014EU9UM,A2M9D9BDHONV3Y,A. Bennett,1/1,1272153600,I guess the larger the can. the fewer the mushrooms!!,I was disappointed in the limited amount of mushroom pieces found in this large. 26 ounce can of mushroom soup.  I'll go back to the small cans that at least have enough mushrooms in them to impart the mushroom flavor and have a bit of mushroom in every spoonful.  Had I known that this was really just cream of chicken soup with the mislabeled name of mushroom attached. I would not have bought this product.  It's still way too high in salt too.  I don't recommend this size can of Campbell's mushroom soup even if it does feed a larger group of people at the dinner table.

I keep my pantry stocked with this grocery item.

Since I have been buying locally in smaller quantities. I feel I have been dumped upon with old product in this purchase - and will likely toss it. Advice:  buy nearer home and check use by dates.  This box comes with loose K-cups inside and no date whatsoever.

I don't want to sound biased. but anyone who loves a strong aromatic coffee would love this kind. I would recommend it to the coffee enthusiast. but that's just me. This won't be so good for those who don't like a very strong. extra bold coffee. If you are one of those who doesn't like a coffee this strong...this isn't for you unfortunately.

Partlow III Victor SHO,1/1,1306281600,Great price for avery versatile cereal.,I love back to basics cold cereals like this (e.g.. cornflakes. raisin bran. frosted mini wheats. etc.).  When you get down to basics you have the option of having it plain when that sweet tooth escapes you or building it up with whatever you wish like sugar. cinnamon. chocolate milk. fresh fruit. anything your palate craves.<br /><br />  I particularly like Chex for another reason. it's unique shape.  I'll usually discount the shape of cold cereal as marketing gimmicks. but in the case of Chex it serves a purpse.  It's doubled wall netting shape allows for Chex to be used to take on othe flavors that allows it to go beyond the cold cereal options.  Yes. I am taking about the famed Chex mix.  You can add savory flavors and others thing to make into a salty snack food to munch on in te classic Chex mix recipe. which is conveniently printed on the box as well as other variations (on my box there were also recipes for Chex Muddy Buddies. a chocolate/peanutbutter frosted mix. and Chili and Garlic Snack Mix).  And let me tell you. you don't know the fantastic taste of Chex until you've had it hot and toasted!  It'll give you a permanent alternative (or additive!) to that movie night bag of popcorn.

Must be Remaindered,I occasionally grab a few pantry goods from Amazon when they're good deals. so at some point. I grabbed this big pack of (supposed) albacore tuna.<br /><br />Well. it didn't go well.<br /><br />The cans arrived incredibly dented. which made me wonder if they were castoffs or remaindered cans that couldn't be sold in other ways due to the quality of the cans.<br /><br />The tuna itself was really strange.  Look. I've bought Bumblebee tuna before and don't remember it being this bad. But this. which is supposed to be white albacore in water. is just the worst quality of tuna I have ever bought. The tuna doesn't look like white albacore at all. but more like the regular. flaky. grainy. browner textured regular tuna.  There is none of the pale. steak-like. albacore consistency in the tuna in these cans at all.<br /><br />It is literally the worst quality of albacore tuna I can ever remember buying.<br /><br />(Meanwhile. if you care about quality. I would suggest the Sustainable Seas albacore as an alternative. It's not much more expensive and the quality is terrific. We bought that shortly after this. and were blown away by how good it was. You get solid. big flakes of beautiful tuna meat that are delicious and also environmentally (and dolphin) friendly.)

This is the only treat I've ever found that she never refuses!  The treats are a bit pricey but. for once. they won't go to waste. I do limit the number she eats in a day. as specified on the bag.
44401,B0018OMTOM,ARPQ0IQQC3PJ7,V. Orcutt,1/1,1245715200,Smelly. but they make my doggies very happy,First of all. they stink.  Imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours.  Yeah. they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that. as it turns out. is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special. in fact. that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates. like at bedtime. or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates. waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them. then I love them.  :)

44432,B000LDQWHG,A1EQBWOC2QYBLK,Elaine Monkey,0/0,1240531200,Fun. engaging toy,This toy keeps my 7 month old husky/german shepherd mix fully engaged for about 20 minutes. We have to prevent her from running. jumping and playing while she recovers from a soft-tissue injury. It's very hard to keep this highly energetic and curious puppy from running around the living room out of frustration and boredom while she heals. The Busy Buddy Bouncy Ball really holds her attention and seems to burn up some of her excess mental and physical energy. She seems calmer afterwards. I can shower. get the laundry and do other chores out of her sight as long as she has her Buddy to play with. The rings are a little pricey. so I don't know if we'll continue to use it after she has healed. But for the next 3 weeks. we are devoted to this toy. I'm going to order a bunch of refill packs right now. so we don't run out! (Caution: 4 rings in 1 night seem to cause loose stools.)

It became his favorite immediately. By itself. it's just a good little chew toy. but the edible Gnawhide rings make it new each time. Beardies need a lot of grooming; daily in fact.

Beware of products that feature $40 savings... Especially if it is a food product.<br /><br />EDIT 12/17/2011<br />Due to my concerns. I phoned Luck Chen and spoke at length about my apprehensions.  The noodles Luck Chen LLC produced were manufactured in China.  The MannaSoy product is manufactured in Israel.  My over critical mind assumed that because on Luck Chen's website (the LLC that is at the 'top' of the business structure. at least as product description reads Manufacturer: Luck Chen') then I felt all products under that name would be suspect of quality as well.  My concerns were fostered by lack of distinction on either Luck Chen's or Manna Soy's websites detailing the different countries of manufacture and lack of highlighting this applies solely to the noodle bowls; the Luck Chen representative said he hadn't considered how that may play out in a customer's mind and said he would work on clearing up that distinction on the websites.<br /><br />I now feel confident in ordering some of the MannaSoy product and giving it a spin in my wok.  Hopefully if anyone should have concerns similar to my initial ones. they will be rested by my experience and Luck Chen's explanation to me.<br /><br />Thanks to Daniel D. STEIN-FREER for challenging my initial comment.
44504,B002N4O8WC,A9NXTC0HTPSDO,Maggie,1/1,1322006400,My Picky Cat LOVES this food!,I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like.  His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it.  It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness. Natural Balanace. Blue Buffalo etc.  The worker said.... just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it.  I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break.  I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors.  Well. there wasn't much to choose from.  Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it.  I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food for me.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy.  My cat loves both of them.  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food.  It seems to be a winner in my house!!

That is. until we picked up Emerald Marcona Almonds. 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4).  It was amazing. we would give these to guests and everyone said these were pretty good. Then we'd give them some Marconas and their faces would light up and say. The Cocoa almonds were good. but these are very good.<br /><br />The Cocoa nuts have a nice rich chocolate flavor and crisp nuttiness. All in all they were good. but they didn't hold a light to the Marcona nuts. Maybe Emerald should make cocoa marconas.<br /><br />Once the Marconas were gone. our six year old made fairly regular covert trips to the kitchen to grab one of these.  So they were hit with him. although since his mom horded the Marconas to herself. he didn't know what he was missing.<br /><br />Definitely was a five star product before Marconas.
44624,B001EQ55RW,A3E3GD3TABXKU1,Loren w Christensen,0/0,1212105600,Wonderful!!,I'm a big nut eater; I make my own peanut butter every couple of days. experimenting with a variety of nuts to combine with the main course. peanuts. Regular almonds are notoriously hard and can even be a little hard on the grinder. But not Emerald's Marcona Almonds.<br /><br />Emerald's cocoa nuts are just a tad harder. but still not as hard as almonds you get in bins or even packaged. The chocolate dusting is just the right amount to give you the cocoa flavor without losing the nut taste. as is the case with some coated versions.<br /><br />I'll probably not make peanut butter out of this flavor but as a healthy snack for the heart - eight to ten nuts a couple times a day - they are perfect.
44642,B001EQ55RW,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,christinemm  - The Thinking Mother,0/0,1211932800,Satisfying Chocolate Taste with the Almonds!,These roasted almonds are coated with cocoa baked onto the outside of the nut. They are made in a way that the cocoa leaves no powder on the hands for no-mess eating. no stickiness. no powder. no mess. These are dry. these are not chocolate candy covered. The cocoa has a strong chocolate taste and is not sweet. it is delicious. The nuts also taste great.<br /><br />This would satisfy a chocolate craving. The great taste of the almonds and cocoa together is delicious!
44650,B001EQ55RW,A3IL4WNBMGBJRY,Brian Smith Tough But Fair,0/0,1211846400,Healthy chocolate snack.  Can it be?,This is a great little snack for those chocolate lovers who want something healthy and a little bonus for their sweet tooth.  The almonds are just lightly coated with cocoa powder. So. it's not the same as having a creamy candy bar. But. you can snack on these for the same amount of calories you'd get with a handful of almonds instead of having a big old fat candy bar.  And. you get all the nutrition of nuts and their good fats with only 1 gram of saturated fat per serving.<br /><br />I'm a chocaholic and true chocaholics don't like their chocolate overly sweet.  These have a hint of a dark chocolate flavor and just a hint of sweetness.  The almonds are nice and crunchy since they are roasted.<br /><br />I gave these four stars out of five.  Some might miss the creaminess of a chocolate bar and these won't completely take the place a of a good piece of dark chocolate.  But.they are great to have around when you just need something to take the edge off of that chocolate craving.
44692,B001EQ55RW,A3EX36SNRYD5VL,TammyJo Eckhart TammyJo Eckhart,0/0,1211328000,Not as good as other Emerald nuts,I'm not a huge almond fan but I can like them.  I am a huge dark chocolate fan so when I saw this product I thought Great.  One serving is approximately 25-27 almonds I measured and contains little bad fat and lots of protein and fiber for the amount.  The cocoa appears to be baked on and not merely sprinkled or the nuts rolled in it because it clings really well to the product.  The almonds are nice and big. well roasted. and taste just like you'd expect from an almond.  There in lay my greatest complaint: the cocoa wasn't very noticeable.  Was it dark cocoa?  Maybe but because the taste was subtle it was a bit difficult for me to tell.  In a world where we need to be eating healthier I know that we might have to change how we eat chocolate but unless almonds are one of your favorite nuts. try one of the many other brands of cocoa-covered or yogurt-covered varieties all in easy to open and reseal containers.  So far. the cocoa-dusted walnuts are my favorite.
44708,B001EQ55RW,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,Sheri in Reho,1/2,1212364800,Chocolate + almonds = A match made in heaven!,Let me just out myself from the get-go here--I am a HUGE chocoholic.  I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted. unsalted almonds nearly every day.  So. when I saw dark chocolate cocoa-roasted almonds offered on amazon. it seemed a match made in heaven. :)<br /><br />What surprised me most. I think. about these delicious cocoa-roasted almonds is that they are not over sweet (only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving).  I worried that they would taste like candy and that is not something I need more of (I am already slave enough to the Sweet Monster!).<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise was that the almonds are not salty.  I have hypertension and need to limit my salt so. when the almonds arrived and I reviewed the nutrition label. I was pleased to see that they only have 25 mg of sodium per 1/4 cup serving and that they are made with dry-roasted vs. oil-roasted almonds.<br /><br />In my chocoholic fervor while ordering. I hadn't paid attention to what size cannister the almonds would come in. so I was again pleasantly surprised to find that they came in a generous 11 oz. cannister.<br /><br />I had some friends over last weekend and put out a dish of the almonds on the table.  I lost count of how many times I heard Mmm! These are GOOD! but I know that the dish was nearly empty when they left.
44714,B001EQ55RW,ABSYIF0ONC2AF,Lee,2/4,1247097600,decent taste. crap ingredients mixed with nuts,These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that label makes no mention that is uses sucralose (aka Splenda) and modified food starch (aka MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome. so it's not worth it putting this garbage into your body. I guess Emerald doesn't realize that the whole point of buying nuts instead of junk food is so that people have a healthier diet.<br /><br />This is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage. all the other brands I've seen have more natural ingredients. Stay away from Emerald brand.

44751,B001EQ55RW,A8WXLST0944GZ,J. Powell,2/2,1211846400,Two tastes that don't mix well,I was excited to try this product.  I am reasonable fan of almonds.  (especially fond of smoked almonds) and I like chocolate.<br />However the combination of the dry cocoa powder. which is slightly bitter. and the dry unsalted taste of the almond doesn't really seem to work.<br />Frankly first impression is one of blandness.<br />Maybe because my palette leans toward the sweet side. these just seem bland.  The combination almost offsets the benefits of either taste.  It's just not a sweet taste. and that was what I expected.
44775,B001EQ55RW,A29ZZKI2II8K0W,Susan Nagel,1/1,1277337600,Great Nuts,Yes. almonds are one of the good foods and so is dark chocolate. Put them together and you've got a can't beat combination. These almonds are toasted to perfection and the antioxidants in there are good for you. The only danger with this terrific snack is the possibility of overeating. Try these one time and no other almonds will compare.
44789,B001EQ55RW,ARFCORBCTKX1J,William Sommerwerck grizzled geezer,1/1,1212192000,not what I expected...,Chocolate without guilt is a good idea. and coating nuts with sweetened cocoa powder (the sweetener is a mixture of a sugar alcohol -- sucralose -- and acesulfame) not a bad one at all. But the result is disappointing.<br /><br />The chocolate and almond tastes tend to hide each other rather than to complement each other. I was expecting an intense chocolate+almond taste. but didn't get it. There wasn't much of either.<br /><br />I tried sucking off the cocoa. but the naked almond was not particularly satisfying. A good almond. but not a great one.<br /><br />Almonds have a relatively delicate taste that (for me) is best appreciated without any enhancement. (I never cared for Jordan almonds.) A cocoa coating would probably work better with a stronger-flavored nut.
44808,B001EQ55RW,A1MFIKCKNCMDG1,Matthew Brand,3/4,1319587200,Good except for artificial sweetener,When I ate my first handful of these I thought wow. these bad boys are amazing and I have a feeling I'll be pounding through a canister really quickly. However. shortly thereafter I had that awful aftertaste in my mouth of artificial sweetener. In shock. I looked at the ingredients and sure enough. there was the dreaded ingredient.<br /><br />All-in-all. not bad if you don't mind artificial sweetener. I hate the stuff so these were not for me.
44809,B001EQ55RW,A3OO4WIO4SKD55,I'm hungry. feed me,5/7,1212019200,Not That great.,While the Almond taste is on point. the chocolate taste is not. They were pretty much just plain dry roasted almonds with Cocoa powder mixed with Splenda sprinkled on them. I could only really taste the chocolate with my first bite. After a few bites. All I could taste is almond. The light chocolate taste was just a little too light for me. And for someone who eats chocolate like it's becoming extinct. this is a bad thing. Plus. the chocolate powder was very difficult to remove from my hands.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great Almond Flavor<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Just a hint of chocolate - for others this may be a pro but for me. EH. not such a good thing<br />2. Coated in a messy chocolate powder. - It's Best if you have mouth to canister contact when eating these.<br /><br />To sum it all up. I've had better.
44819,B001EQ55RW,AJJS2MZGTN22Z,Deb S,0/0,1348185600,Emerald Cocoa Roasted Almonds. dark chocolate,This is the best dark chocolate roasted almonds out there. I tried Blue Diamond & other brands. this one's the best. Note: it does NOT have sugar. no gooey chocolate coating. just a dusting of dark chocolate powder. About 21 almonds have 150 calories. It's great for diabetics and low carb eaters. Even a few almonds helps with hunger. It's so delicious that if you have a sweet tooth. and would have a craving for a chocolate bar. this will do the trick. But since they are so delicious. the trick is to eat just a few at a time. You can order this via Amazon as I do. for convenience. but it is widely available at major stores as well.

44844,B000FPM5DA,A135JF4AOBLMAZ,Delta Lady,0/0,1245715200,Nice Surprise for Pups!,We have a small terrier mix and two chihuahua mixed pups. The terrier is very curious and loves when the mailman brings boxes ~ she has to go through everything with me when I open them and then turns the box over to make sure nothing is left inside of it. Occasionally. she gets her own box with pup toys (which I am also looking into ordering from Amazon as they have some nice products and many 4 for 3 deals). etc.. so these were a great treat for her to find in a box full of towel sets I had also ordered. There were more in the package than I had expected. all the pups liked them (the terrier. the largest. is 16 pounds). I could see how a larger pup would go through these very fast however they were a perfect surprise for our smaller pups and at one a day for each of them. will last a little while. For the price however. they were a great treat and a good value for us. And our little terrier mix is just beside herself with joy that there was something special in the box just for her (and the other pups as well).
44857,B000MT8AT2,A3M3Y7TCOHJYGX,Maiko Kanahashi,0/0,1220745600,yummy,this is very good. it's hard but i like it like that. it's not that chewy like taffy. it's a bit sweet so i cant eat it all at the same time but it's good to have a piece or two after dinner. my dad also liked this with his coffee (but he had a hard time eating it because he has false teeth). the fact that it comes in bite size packets is very convenient. try it. it's super yummers :)
44867,B0035N3AK6,ALAEE9UOW8F0N,M. Vyas,1/2,1334966400,Great taste. great price,Love the taste of this sauce. We have been using this for over a year. Great price. good quality. using this makes the pasta very yummy. A great buy.

They taste healthy. keep me full when I grab one for a quick breakfast on the go. or work well for a quick snack without guilt or huge sugar spike.<br /><br />I love that they are on the subscription list...keep them coming!
44899,B003TIVBBC,A2TN9C5E4A0I3F,Jimmy,0/0,1301616000,I liked them but found they contain MSG unfortunately :(,I liked these (although not as much as the chocolate chip) and the ingredients and vitamins seemed good (even though a tad too sweet) but..everytime I'd eat one I'd become ill.  I couldn't figure out why until I researched the ingredients.<br /><br />I'm moderately to severely allergic to MSG and it gets worse as I get older.  I kept reading the ingredients wondering if there was something in these affecting me and after a little internet research found that the Maltodextrin. Brown Rice Syrup. Natural Flavorings. Whey Protein Isolate and possibly a few other ingredients contain varying amounts of MSG.  The combination of all these was enough to make me sick.  I'll have to stick to snacks without such a high combination as other snacks haven't had such an effect on me. They did taste good. however... :(
44903,B000WBM7BC,A26KUYU8N0DA4P,HeavyElectronicsBuyer Aaava,0/1,1203724800,Great stuff.,The first bottle showed up broken. and they rectified this situation nicely (of course I didn't need 2 phone calls...just what we ordered).  But it's the thought that counts.  They went overboard to make sure we were happy.<br /><br />And the vinegar is a gem.  Try it on a steak on the grill!
44919,B000LKV4QI,A1ERE0L96Y00ZL,Michael Ofjord,3/3,1196467200,goodness and sweetness without necessary extras,I have been using this product for about a year now.  It tastes good and the cinnamon and raisins add just the right sweetness. without added sugar.  The price on Amazon makes it more affordable. and since it is organic. the amount of pesticides would be less. making it more healthy for you.  Definitely a winner!
44926,B000LKV4QI,AITBP6FG5A3I3,Cape Kelly,1/1,1316736000,Ezekiel 4:9 Cereal Organic Sprouted Grain. Cinnamon Raisin,This is my husband's favorite cereal. and we get the best price and delivery from Amazon. We were surprised with the latest delivery. The big box was marked Cinnamon Raisin. however. the content was Golden Flax. I was ready to send it back. but my husband said he'd try it. He liked it! He added cinnamon and raisins and has it for breakfast every day.
44927,B000LKV4QI,A110ZUAFKIAYS3,Anne K. Simmons doodlemum,1/1,1316563200,Didn't think I'd like it but now I'm hooked,My nutritionist put me on on a low carb. no added sugar diet. and this brand was one that was recommended for cereals. When I saw it in the bowl. I worried. The grains are small and the almond milk I added seemed to vanish into the dense cereal quicksand. Yes. it has taken a little to get used to the texture. but I've really grown to enjoy the taste. It is rich. not cardboard- or grass-like. as can happen with so many simple. stripped down cereals. The raisins add just a touch of sweetness; I don't miss the added sugar I would get in a granola or similar cereal. And the nutrition content is excellent compared to many natural cereals.
44938,B000LKV4QI,AWQJTSL4MHDXL,Kavita Ramani Kat,0/1,1338940800,The raisins are terrible!,I recently discovered Ezekiel cereals. and I bought two boxes: Cinnamon Raisin and Almond. Almond is awesome! I love it with almond milk. agave. and blueberries. It's filling and fabulous!<br /><br />Cinnamon Raisin would be good if it wasn't loaded with rock-hard tiny raisins. They are terrible! They have no taste. and are somewhat difficult to chew.<br /><br />I will never get Cinnamon Raisin again. but I look forward to trying Golden Flax and Original. and picking up another box of Almond.
44939,B000LKV4QI,A1LJN0NCDXZEQO,Alan,6/12,1288224000,I love it but,I broke a tooth eating the cereal.  It's not just a feeling that it could happen. I'm not happy right now.
44941,B000LKV4QI,AHGYQDAT001DC,Scorpion,5/14,1315267200,Make your own & save some money,I bought a box of this recently.  Even though it sounded pretty healthy. I figured. how bad can it be.<br /><br />Well. I just had my first serving. and decided that I would share a recipe that very closely approximates the taste and texture of this cereal.  Here it is:<br /><br />4 cups course saw dust<br />1 cup raisins<br />2 Tablespoons sugar<br />1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />Blend all ingredients. serve with cold milk.<br /><br />How on earth can anyone give this stuff more than one star?  The serving size listed on the box is 1/2 cup. First of all. who eats 1/2 cup of cereal?  I doubled up on the serving. and poured a full cup in the bowl... added some 2% organic milk..... yummmm!  Wrong!  Now I know why the serving size is specified at 1/2 cup..... anybody that can gag down more than a half cup of this stuff in one sitting. is a better man than I am. Seriously.... what possible reason could anyone have for eating this stuff?  I tried my best to choke down this stuff. but the more I ate. the worse the experience became.  About a third of the way through. I cried uncle and dumped the remaining meal in the trash.<br /><br />There may be a use for this cereal. but eating it. is not a viable option.  I don't even think birds or small rodents would want to eat it.  I may mix it with some water. and fill some of the cracks in my driveway with it.
44946,B0029NTQ1K,A39RRUSJP76BO6,N. Grover nancat,0/0,1326412800,Really works for hairballs!,Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time. our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny. hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!

44989,B0029NTQ1K,A3P3S46A8MXK10,T. Williams,0/2,1257638400,Not for kittens less than 6 months old!,My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites. which he LOVES!). but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross. I know). so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully. they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.
44991,B0029NTQ1K,A1TNK6MP89YXY2,Jamie R. Wilson,7/7,1249689600,The name does them no justice. The cat loves these things!,I found these in a local Petco and decided to try them with my friend's cat. The cat has gone crazy for these things! I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs. try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand. or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting. but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.
44998,B0029NTQ1K,AZPOFLFAWXON,Sleepy,6/7,1265587200,Does wonders for bad breath,We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice. but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat. but when she would yawn in your lap. you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took Dentabites more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her. but well. thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites. we noticed her breath improved and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone. or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also. since then. we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

I give about 5-6 of these to my cats every day and they gobble them right up.  Leaves their breath 'better' than normal (not like they've just brushed or anything) and they never leave any behind.

Like many of the reviewers here my cat now acts like an addict. I don't know what they put in this stuff. but she wants it all day and all night. It's gotten so she has started pestering me non stop. I'm glad I found a treat she likes. but it's a nightmare if we run out. I just came on here to order another box. I'm not sure if I want to keep dealing with this. I might have to consider kitty cat rehab.

I can't even order them on Amazon for reasons I don't fully understand. What am I going to do? His Royal Majesty (I mean the cat. of course) MUST have his Catnip Temptations! He's addicted. I can't drive down there in the winter when the roads are bad (like right now). He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab.

They like this flavor. but something tells me they like the animal flavors better. whether it is fish or mammals. Don't get me wrong they love this flavor. but I don't think it is the best flavor you can buy.<br /><br />Temptations is most likely the best treat brand you can buy though. they never fail.

45133,B003EJ3YPM,AERBY54RWPSO9,A. Woodmansee,0/0,1316044800,Best brownie mix EVER!,We started eating healthier about 9 years ago and a major part of that was eating all 100% whole grains.  Now. these are brownies. so they have a lot of sugar in them. so that does not fit in with our lifestyle as much. but if you are going to be bad a least do it 100% whole grain with excellent taste and texture!  They are so richly chocolate it is amazing. and the chocolate chips don't hurt either!  Honestly you'd never know they are 100% whole grain.  they do take quite a lot of fat. a whole stick of butter plus 2 T oil. but you can substitute.  It is said that for any brownie mix on the market. to make them more healthy you can substitute any/all of the fats/liquids asked for in the instructions except the eggs (so like oil. butter. water) for an equal amount of any of the following: yogurt. apple sauce. pureed black beans.  I have not been brave enough yet to try the black beans. but I did try yogurt and apple sauce. they were fine. there was a bit of taste to each of those but not too much. and of course the texture was a little different without the fat.  We belong to a CSA and get a 3/4 bushel box of fresh local organic veggies/fruit each week during the growing season and one week I had a bundle of baby beet that I did not know what to do with. so I boiled them. peeled them. pureed them. and substituted them in the Big Bear Brownies for the oil. butter. and water.and they were great!  I served them twice when company was over and everyone loved them and asked for seconds. and my girls love them and ask for more and dig the slight pink tint they brownies have.  Next I am going to experiment with pureed summer squash :)  Now I am just waiting for Kodiak Cakes to come up with a recipe for chocolate cake!  No matter what you do. if you want to still be able to eat brownies but want to do it healthier without sacrificing a thing then get these brownies!

Small pieces of stems were left on.  The flavor was difficult to discern because of the difficulty I had chewing these dried pears. I would recommend their apple chips. They are small. but tasty and definately chip-like in texture and much easier to eat.

There are no limits to what you can make with it by adding leftovers or whatever you have on hand.

This is a large container of seasoning though and I feel this will last me for a year.<br /><br />I bought 3 smaller packs of this seasoning at target and I gave 2 to my relatives. I recently found that Target stopped keeping these on their shelves and I had couple of restless weeks eating land popcorn. Glad to find this on Amazon!
45206,B005SSM64W,A13QLFTU0I8PSZ,rk,0/0,1334620800,Not bad,Got this to sprinkle on almonds and walnuts as an alternative to purchasing more expensive flavored nuts. It's okay; a little sharp. I may try soaking the nuts in water and then sprinkling with this so the flavor is more infused.
45210,B002QGFY1G,A15BJ22M0NXP2U,KMcInnes,0/0,1329609600,Very Good!!,These breakfast cookies are delicious! They have a fresh ginger taste. and they really do keep you full. I usually have a small snack about two hours after breakfast. but since eating these. I don't feel hungry again for at least 4 hours. At 290 calories. I would recommend them to anyone who needs a quick. healthy breakfstt.
45217,B002Q2RNXC,A1IRA6Y0BP87BZ,august,0/0,1336176000,There is nothing like this,Carte Noire is simply the best French coffee from France you can buy on line: It is every thing the French like in coffee: dark. rich and cheap.  Unlike the American coffee medium roast. it the best dark-medium roast you can buy.
45219,B005MHRCPM,AOSV7VXZQ1EI2,Colette Vallee,0/0,1351036800,Great Gym Snack for Adults,Healthy. tasty and portable.  These packets are great 'on-the-go' and perfect for the gym bag.  When you can't tote around fresh. this is the next best option.  More pear than mango flavor and the texture of smooth applesauce.  Most recently. packed these for a work trip.  It was a good way to add a little something healthy to the hotel and fast food that often dominate when it comes to business travel.
45230,B001650X8C,A2AV1LZY0VBF8C,Ms Muffet,0/0,1275609600,So-So Sweet & Sour Sauce,I was glad to find these Kraft Sweet & Sour<br />Sauce cups at Amazon because Kraft has<br />discontinued the bottles that I used to<br />buy at the grocery store.  The sauce itself<br />is just so-so; OK but nothing real special.<br />I've had much better at Asian restaurants.<br />We've tried several other brands sold at<br />the grocery store in the Oriental foods<br />section. but we still haven't found one<br />that we consider excellent.  These will do<br />for now because I frequently make homemade<br />chicken tenders and wings and the sweet/sour<br />is our favorite flavor of dipping sauce.<br />These little cups are very convenient to<br />throw in the picnic basket or lunch bag too.
45270,B001VEFHYI,A3VNKHHGLG82UM,Vivian,4/4,1289260800,Aromatic,I have been looking for healthier sweeteners.  Coconut sugar is supposed to be less processed and I do like the taste.  It is fragrant. with subtle layers of coconut flavour. so if you don't want your beverage to acquire any additional flavour then this is not for you.  It is also less sweet than regular white sugar. which is good.  Overall. I think the flavour is lovely and it doesn't bother me even in teas like Earl Grey.
45278,B000OV5NBG,A3DW2PDLSR4UMO,Rachel Bennett mynicemonster,10/12,1249171200,Ganocafe Classic,Ganocafe is a product derived from coffee. so it retains the flavor of coffee. but the Reishi mushroom is what I enjoy most about this product. Reishi mushroom is not an easy ingredient to find and has been touted as a wonderdrug for hundreds of ailments and preventative for even more. including many forms of cancer.<br />I'm unable to consume caffeine. so I had to find alternatives. Many coffee alternatives taste too earthy or forest-y and not much like coffee at all.<br />This is the best that I've found.<br />The classic style is no cream. no sugar. just a plain old cup of coffee and while it's not exactly like coffee. it's the closest to the real flavor.<br />For all the people out there who can't drink coffee. enjoy!
45302,B00008MOJ2,A2FARFFX86JKH5,Christopher Whitmore,0/0,1345161600,My dog's preferred snack.,My picky Italian Greyhound goes crazy for these!  Definitely his favorite snack of many.  There are four distinct flavors and the dog even gets more excited for some over others.  Firm/dense but not rock hard.  Enough to give a decent teeth cleaning but little dogs can still break them apart.  They crumble when chewed but not particularly messy like some dry snacks.  I was really disappointed to not find them locally anymore but at least we can get them online.

45309,B0005XN9HI,AYZEW13PHE0L4,Eva Campos,33/33,1140998400,It lasts!,If you buy tomatoe paste in a can. you always find yourself having to throw some away because you could not use it all up in time. I have never had to throw away any tomatoe paste that came in a tube. It stays fresh till it is all used up. It adds great taste to your food.
45322,B0005XN9HI,A1W8OY1CH31XDP,Coyote Osborne,3/7,1309305600,Overhyped and inferior,The tomato flavor is inferior. the taste is extremely acidic compared to others. and there is a weird. sweet-metallic aftertaste. Even a small amount taints everything it is used in with the odd aftertaste. which I assume comes from the packaging. I am throwing the remainder of the tube away and using a canned brand from now on. Even if I throw away half the can. it would be less expensive. and more edible. When compared to home-made tomato paste. or even cheap canned brands. this product simply doesn't measure up.
45335,B001KP8EO8,A34TRQJRAM4MYQ,Dawn K Just your average culinary ninja!,1/1,1324771200,Great product. reliable shipping!,I ordered two 5-pound bags of these candied orange peels. The quality and flavor were great. I dipped them in chocolate and everyone raved about them. Shipping was quick and reliable.
45356,B003GHESE8,A18K1W1Z479QII,mismatch,0/0,1332892800,These are way too tasty,I ordered these thinking they were made in England..needed something to go along with a classroom talk. However. they are a Scottish product. And they are so very good! Love them!
45366,B003GHESE8,A9EITRL6FI9SY,DJ44,1/3,1297036800,Nice cookies,Very nice cookies and Amazon shipping was also fast. My kid loves them. The only thing is the price. I bought similar ones in Costco before with much cheaper unit price. However. couldn't find anymore in Costco after Xmas.
45387,B0011MTYF8,A2VX1KP8I6IFD3,Bob R. Bob R.,6/6,1275782400,Great taste and value,These syrups are absolutely delicious! If you like snow cones. and are tired of weak or diluted-tasting syrups. try these. The flavor is anything but weak and they make you want to go back for more. This assortment is a great value. but if you have lots of family and friends over for your frozen treats. they will go fast! I highly recommend them.
45388,B0011MTYF8,AVDVKPF4REV5E,Eric S. Middleton Eric,5/5,1316044800,Great product for all ages and yummy!!!,I purchased this big old pack from these folks and it is awesome! My kids and I had shaved ice all summer long. We have purchased other brands but I have to be honest their syrup is the best and I have tired them all. I highly recommend this product!
45400,B0011MTYF8,A26NECI2KRMQHG,James Warren James,1/1,1326499200,Slushy's at home,This case gives you a wide selection of flavors to put on any crushed ice slushy. The kids really like these on those hot TX days. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a little pool side fun.
45407,B0011MTYF8,A2IJQQXE135IK7,David Lemoine Crazy Dave,1/1,1317254400,Oh. the flavors we will taste!,A while back I bought the three pack of Hawaiian Shaved Ice flavors Blue Raspberry.cherry. and grape.  My family loved these flavors. but my 8 year old loves mixing flavors. so as soon as this ten pack arrived she mixed up a strawberry/watermelon/banana snow cone.  I tried a pina colada/banana snow cone and later a Tigers Blood.  I'm not sure why its called that. but it is delicious.  The yellow banana syrup will probably bring out some yellow snow jokes. but its worth it for the taste.  I love the fact you don't have to refrigerate these. because I certainly don't have room in the refrigerator for all ten bottles. and I suspect my daughter will try mixing all ten in one snow cone before long! :)
45409,B0011MTYF8,A2PH1TFA5UU4HZ,Donna Espo,0/0,1345075200,purchaser,We recently decided to purchase a snow cone machine. Of course. we needed supplies and syrup. Hawaiian shaved ices offered both sugar free and regular flavors. They are great and fun to mix em up! What a great summer treat and no calories. I would definitely purchase again.
45411,B0011MTYF8,A19NN5F4Q08S4C,Timothy L,0/0,1344470400,Tastes Great!,We had a yard sale and sold snow cones with Hawaiian Shaved Ice snow cone syrups! It was a huge hit! I especially liked the choice of 10 flavors...I will definetly be ordering more as we will be having several more yard sales before the season is over!
45415,B0011MTYF8,AQ4BZY7SKEAGV,Jessica,0/0,1342396800,Snow Cone Time!,I ordered this for my kid's home snow cone machine.  Got the product a few days before it was estimated to arrive.  Kids were so excited.  Perfect blend of different flavors.  Everyone is enjoying snow cones this summer!
45417,B0011MTYF8,A2N70JZZSRDH94,Pat L.,0/0,1341532800,Great flavors for snow cones,I purchased the 10-pack Hawaiian shaved ice snow cone syrups. and so far have been delighted with them.  We have tried three flavors so far -  Cherry. Root Beer. and Tiger's Blood.  The Tiger's Blood has so far been the favorite. but all three are very good - nice. smooth flavors that are not weak at all. and not over-powering either.  Much better than some of the others I've tried from the grocery stores.  Everyone. including the adults. have enjoyed them. and though I've made my own. these are better - and much less work!  My grandson. who is 7. recommends mixing flavors; his particular favorite is the tiger's blood mixed with the root beer.  I highly recommend these syrups and am looking forward to enjoying the remaining flavors.<br /><br />The syrups arrived very quickly. and were very well packed - no cracked or leaky bottles.  I'll order these again!

We purchased the snow cone machine last year and needed more syrup for this summer.  It is a wonderful idea for the kids to make their own snow cones and share with friends.  They have many choices for flavoring so everyone is happy.
45430,B0011MTYF8,AFYQ1A9C0G3HT,Karen Karen,0/5,1282608000,Mediocre at Best,not impressed with the flavors of these syrups.  not worth the premium price tag for sure.

45444,B003NC71FO,A1QJ0UMSIE1MCP,David Alexander,0/0,1301529600,Great flavor buttery topping,I've been using this heavily on popcorn ever since I got it. I use a Whirley-Pop with Wabash Farms 4 Ounce popcorn kits. That already has pretty good butter flavor and coloration. but this topping just puts it into movie theater zone. The individual bottles are fairly small. so you can even give them to each person so they can drizzle it on their bowl of popcorn as they please.
45451,B001HWSVQ0,A1H4CAZKYMOXON,Adica,1/1,1303257600,My Bunny Goes Nuts For These,My bunny loves her yogurt yummies.  They're simply timothy hay pellets coated in different flavors of yogurt.  My bunny becomes very excited when I open the bag.  She immediately runs over to me and starts trying to climg the walls of her pen.  It's very adorable.  My bunny is too young to have fresh fruit yet (I'm just now starting to introduce her to fresh vegetables). and I like these treats because they're pretty inexpensive and not as unhealthy as most other treats you can buy for your bunny.  These treats have a minimum 12% fat. while most other treats I've seen are a minimum 20% fat.

It is a little heavy. but tastes good. especially as toast.I tried Pamela's bread mix. but found it to be too sweet for my taste. I do think Pamela's baking mix is excellent. however. I use it for pancakes and any baking that calls for flour.
45478,B0000GL6RU,ATAML2Y7A9DKV,kprien,0/0,1339200000,Not varied like shown,I ordered this to try all the different types of drink and I was sent a lot of watermelon and strawberry and 1 hibiscus. The drinks also do not mix well and are clumpy.
45482,B000XBCBW6,AMHEQSGUAN6FN,Guitar Steve,3/3,1208217600,Add this CD to your collection!,If you are a fan of Chicago blues. you cannot go wrong with this disc.  It is impeccable in its style and execution and pays homage to the great Chicago blues artists.  If you are a blues fan who likes guitar pyrotechnics rather than heartfelt emotions expressed in the lyrics and the music. this disc may not be for you.  Altogether. one of the finest blues disks by a contemporary artist that I have heard in a long. long time.
45523,B0041NYV8E,A27CTW0GPEE0AZ,Firefly,0/0,1333411200,Really Good !!!!,Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix is very good ! It smelled amazing when I opened the pkg & even more so when I added the water. It comes in a granulated form & smells very warm and spicey and its a nice rich brown color. It also tastes warm & spicey goin down... It tastes sweet so it doesn.t need sweetner . I really liked it. I think it would also make good iced tea.
45527,B0041NYV8E,A2RHV42BTJSVON,Liolania In2Jesus,0/0,1333065600,What Can I Say....?,Honestly. I always want to write as positive as a review as possible. but I can't think of anything positive to write about this drink.<br /><br />  On one hand. I'm glad i only received one as a sample so I didn't have to waste the rest. but on the other hand. giving it another go would have been feasible if I had more than one packet of mix.  Sadly. I took one sip of it. and had to spit it out. I couldn't taste any lemon. all I tasted was ginger (which is fine since its a ginger drink. but its the TEXTURE I take issue with!) and that it essentially tasted (texture-wise) like I'd put a bunch of ginger powder in a glass with some sugar and hot water in a blender and dumped it in a glass and called it good.  I would have gotten the same results had I done that. and it would be cheaper too.<br /><br />  It was grainy. and it was way too gingery for my taste.  Now. let me tell you. I DO enjoy ginger tea!  I make ginger tea from fresh ginger root for nausea or just to enjoy and it is very tasty. I also enjoy ginger chews on occasion. and crystallize ginger every now and then as a snack as well. so I am not a ginger hater!  But. for me. this drink was just lacking. and you'd be better off making a nice cup of hot ginger tea from fresh ginger root. its cheaper. has a better feel in your mouth. and its not going to take anymore work then this beverage will.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
45529,B0041NYV8E,A3HQAPXAJV7PRX,Diane Kistner,0/0,1332979200,Satisying drink,I was given only one packet to review. so I had to divide it in half. A half packet is plenty for a good-sized. pretty strong drink. I like the ginger/lemon mix a lot. It's heavier on ginger than lemon. so it's not too tart.<br /><br />I tried it in hot water and also in the bottom of a glass into which I poured some Sodastream seltzer and stirred. Ginger. as most people know. is hot. In hot water it is hot caliente and hot calor. Drinking it hot is the way it's supposed to be done (says so on the packet). and it's great for cold weather and when you have a cold. But it's so hot where we live already that I want my liquids cold. Mixed in seltzer. half a packet made for a decent drink but the granules don't melt as well in cold water.<br /><br />If I get more of this mix. I will probably mix it up in hot water. then cool it in the fridge before drinking (at least in the hotter months). Maybe make a jar of it along with my sun tea. The per-packet price is reasonable. I think. for something that has herbal/medicinal benefit as well as being just something good to drink.
45535,B0041NYV8E,A3AZI828WJN1CD,Becky (beckygardens),0/0,1332892800,strong ginger. weak lemon. sweet,The gold kili mixed easily. no clumps in my cup of hot liquid. The smell was very nice. although I could really only pick up the ginger.<br /><br />Sipping. the ginger hit me first. In fact. the beverage tasted of ginger and sweet. There didn't seem to be a balance between ginger and lemon. Eventually I picked up a very odd lemon taste. sort of like when I sprayed lemon pledge and accidentally inhaled. it doesn't so much taste lemony as vaguely lemon chemical. Heavy ginger. very sweet. not for me.<br /><br />I think I'd rather squeeze my own lemon. toss in a slice of ginger and a bit of honey in a cup of hot water. Between the way to sweet and the fake chemical lemon aftertaste. this is not my cup of beverage.

Much Better with Milk.,Do you like <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM8308>Ginger People Gin-Gins Hard Candy -- 3 oz</a>?  If so. there is a good chance that you'll like Gold Kili's Ginger & Lemon drink mix.<br /><br />This is a ginger. lemon & honey drink mix.  It is spicy.  It has honey but is not syrupy sweet.  The ginger is much more predominant than the lemon.  As a stand alone in the recommended 8.45oz of hot water. the drink was too ginger/spicy for me (I like spicy).  After I added milk. the drink became pretty good.  However. the mix is strong enough to hold up to more water + milk.<br /><br />This drink mix is not something that I would reach for as a daily drink (like afternoon tea); however. I think it would be very soothing as a hot drink when I'm not feeling 100%.<br /><br />This ginger/lemon drink has a unique taste.  It is interesting & worth a shot if you like both ginger & spicy drinks.
45560,B0041NYV8E,A1R1BFJCMWX0Y3,KO,0/0,1332374400,Maybe if you're sick,This might be soothing if you are under the weather. This is not the kind of tea I'd like to drink at night relaxing. I found the smell to be very strong and the taste more like medicine. I was not a fan of this. I love Ginger but this was just to overwhelming to enjoy.
45577,B0041NYV8E,A3DZFEICHK5LF2,Just Trying to Help Product Guru,0/0,1332288000,Sweet with a bite to it,This is a tasty ginger drink. served hot.  Before you add the 8oz of water it looks a bit like powdered ice tea.<br /><br />I don't know that it's for everyone.  If you know that ginger is a bit spicy then go ahead.  Its like a ginger snap on steroids.  But it's also a bit sweet. sweeter than I expected.<br /><br />It's very fragrant- I love the smell.<br /><br />Overall I would say its a success. if you are looking for a hot ginger drink.
45599,B0041NYV8E,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,ThisThatNEverything thisthatneverything,0/0,1332201600,I don't think I could force myself to drink this if I was being paid...,This drink tasted absolutely awful to me.  I don't think I could even force myself to drink this if offered big bucks to do so.  I took one sip and cringed.  The taste was awful and very bitter.  I tried to force myself to take another sip but I could barely get it past my lips.  It was horrible.  My husband tried it and so did my daughter and neither of them like it either.  The smell was really bad as well.  Just smelling it made me want to get sick.  I know this is a harsh review but it's 100% honest.<br /><br />I've never had a Ginger & Lemon drink before but. I enjoy lemonade as well has hot or cold tea in many different varieties but this is not something that I would recommend to anybody.
45615,B0041NYV8E,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,C. F. Hill CFH,0/0,1332201600,Strong Ginger Flavor - Recommended Served Hot,This Gold Kili Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix is quite strong if an entire packet is used in a normal 12oz sized cup. but just about right (for me) at half strength. This is an interesting combination of flavors. with the ginger being significantly more prominent than the more subtle lemon and honey.<br /><br />I first tried this made hot on a morning with a sore throat (likely from snoring) and found it to be nicely soothing and enjoyable (at half strength). Later in the day we tried it cold and. while it was drinkable. it was not as good and really reminded us more of a medical concoction (couldn't even imagine how overpowering it would be at full strength).<br /><br />So. at half strength. this is a very nice warm ginger beverage that works wonders on a rough throat but. for my tastes. a little too much as a cold drink.<br /><br />Recommended. with the caveats above.<br /><br />CFH
45666,B0041NYV8E,A1GB85UEMFD4WZ,Lili P. Betancourt,0/0,1329436800,effective digestion aid,I sent for this product on a whim. I used half a packet in warm water just to see what it tasted like. The ginger imparts a strong bitter flavor so I wouldn't use this unless I needed to. The following week I had an opportunity to try out it's effectiveness when I suffered some acid indigestion that I normally treat with chamomile tea. I had even taken an acid reducer with mild results before I remembered to try the Gold Kili. It relieved all symptoms! I need to order more to keep on hand.
45673,B0041NYV8E,A1E1L1OJZQI3OO,M. Stewart,0/0,1329350400,Tasty and Tangy,This drink is easy to make; just tear open the notched foil pouch. pour into a cup. add hot water and stir.  It has a good taste. with a fair ginger bite. and a subtle lemon taste.  The honey is just enough to keep it from being too bitter.  Of course you could add a bit more honey if you wish. Simple ingredients. no caffeine.  A winner.
45674,B0041NYV8E,AUAX1QWUCYKSX,Ashley S,0/0,1329350400,One bag goes a long way,I've always loved this stuff. especially for colds. and Gold Kili does a fine job with this product.<br /><br />Although you could put the entire contents of one bag in a beverage. I actually prefer to put a little bit at a time in some tea to add the ginger and lemon flavor to the tea. Using the entire bag would probably produce too strong of a flavor for my liking.<br /><br />I especially love this drink when I'm sick or taking care of someone that is sick; it's really good for a cold.
45703,B0041NYV8E,A2T5R4NOTKFBQV,Michael Monji Tree Whisperer,0/0,1328227200,Gold Kili Instant Ginger Lemon Drink,If you don't mind the taste of ginger. then this is a great product. It takes a few drinks to get used to it. but then it starts to grow on you. It is very soothing to your stomach. I highly recommend you try it.
45718,B0041NYV8E,A2XCCN239AR1XK,Kilgore Gagarin Those who believe in telekin...,1/1,1333065600,Nice gingery bite - Mmmm! Good with a bit of tequila!,Nice. gingery bite kind of like you get with strong ginger cookies. VERY sweet beverage. This is worth trying if you like pungent. aromatic. tangy. bitey. spicy. sweet beverages (I do). The ginger flavor seems to overwhelm the lemon flavor. I don't drink ginger drinks. but enjoy the pickled ginger you get with some dishes at Japanese restaurants.<br /><br />I poured this into a coffee mug with hot water microwaved for two and one half minutes (shy of boiling). My son (post teenager. just a man) sipped it and said. blechhh. My wife and I (over 50 each) sipped it and said. Hmmm ... this would be nice on a cold day.<br /><br />I'm sipping it  now. enjoying it quite nicely as I write this review. I think you'll have to try it to see if you'll like it. Recommended for people who like ginger who personally may not like it. but worth trying. If you're not into pungent and tangy beverages. consider passing.<br /><br />FAST UPDATE: Mmmmm ... kind of nice with an ounce of tequila!
45722,B0041NYV8E,A3RLNYIEW60LR8,KDub Book Babe,0/0,1328140800,Nice Ginger Drink...,This was a pretty good drink however I barely taste lemon.  Ginger is strong and it is very strong in this drink so it is not suprising that the lemon is overpowered.  If you really like ginger I would recommend this product.  I like ginger but I was expecting a nice lemon/ginger mix.  It is not bad but I would not purchase.
45724,B0041NYV8E,A2F7XU97CYFHDY,Aaron C. Brown,0/0,1328140800,Excellent home remedy. not a beverage,Some other reviewers seem to have expected a pleasant drink. or a tea. I think this product is intended more for people who drink ginger infusions for their sinus-clearing. throat-cleansing effects. I realize the manufacturer cannot sell it as a remedy. but if you drink ginger and honey anyway. this product is a decent substitute that is much more convenient than finding fresh ginger then simmering it yourself.<br /><br />For years I have relied on ginger infusions when I get mild coughs or stuffiness in the winter. It cures the symptoms and I believe (without any formal evidence) that it stops things from progressing into a cold. Anyway. it's comforting. Unfortunately. it's tricky. Finding fresh ginger is not easy and you must infuse it precisely. It must be sliced very thinly (grating is not as good) and put into water just below the boiling point. If the water is too cool. you don't get the most important volatiles. If the water boils. or if you leave it simmering too long. the good stuff denatures or evaporates. When it's just right it has a very strong flavor and aroma. which I find pleasant but is quite pungent. and it leaves your mouth and throat tingling. A small amount of honey seems to enhance the effects.<br /><br />This packet appears to have the right mix of fresh ginger and honey. treated in some manner to preserve potency in its foil packet. Shockingly. however. there is no ingredient labeling (only the claim that it contains no caffine). The Amazon page shows only ginger. honey and natural lemon flavor; but then warns you not to rely on that information. So anyone with allergies has to steer clear of this product until the manufacturer puts the ingredients on the package. However. I chose to live dangerously and drink it anyway. and had no problems. Like the real thing. you should use extremely hot but not quite boiling water. and drink it immediately after mixing (yes. that's hard to do without burning your tongue. but if you wait for it to cool. you lose a lot of the effect). The package recommends 250 ml (about one cup) of water. I think that makes the drink too weak and also it's hard to get that much hot liquid down quickly. I suggest about two-thirds of that amount.<br /><br />I don't know if this product will keep you healthy. but my guess is it can make you feel better and it likely doesn't hurt. Other ginger/honey beverages I have tried are usually far too sweet and lack the punch from plenty of real. fresh ginger.
45728,B0041NYV8E,A1B05INWIDZ74O,M. A. Ramos,0/0,1328054400,Ginger Drink with Bite,There is no question that Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from ginger. The smell and taste is strong. I would suggest you start off light and continue too add the mix until you reach the strength of flavor you desire. I could not imagine how strong a bite this drink would have if not cut with honey. I do agree that with the advertisement that this is a strong ginger drink with a unique taste. My first sip shocked my taste buds that I almost did not continue to drink any. I did continue too and as I started too adjust to the flavor. The drink was not bad and it still had the ginger bite I wanted but this is not a blend I would seek out. I would drink but never buy it. Though flavorful; I did not find the experience enjoyable. The crystals do instantly dissolve to make this spicy beverage. And with the taste...I hope it is good for you.
45731,B0041NYV8E,A2AU79QNPXAVG6,Warren Rachele Doulos Christou,0/0,1328054400,ALL CAPS Ginger!,The little silver pouches are a ginger lover's dream. Whether served hot (as I drink it) or cold. the crystals dissolve instantly. emitting only a slight hint at what lies in store at the first sip. The ginger will strike the back of your throat and make itself known. overwhelming any hint of lemon in the drink. The strength of ginger is not something that most people are ambivalent about. you either enjoy it or not. If this is to your taste you will like this tea as you long as you adjust the relative strength by adding more or less water to the mix.
45738,B0041NYV8E,ADSFKIX44X8JV,Jill Guntur,0/0,1327881600,Not to my taste,I had high hopes because I like Ginger and Lemon.  Not always happy with the way that honey tastes when it is previously added to drink mixes.<br />Having said that. I have no idea what it is about the mixture but it smells a little bit like brewer's yeast to me both before I added water and after.<br />I did my level best to drink the cup of Gold Kili and the best I could do was four or five sips.<br />The ginger and lemon do not come through in a significant way.  The drink is overly sweet.  And. as mentioned... it smells different than you might expect and to me was not pleasant.
45741,B0041NYV8E,A1H5FQ5ISJGO57,Scott Fisher,0/0,1327795200,More ginger than lemon and slightly sweet,This instant ginger lemon drink has a very strong ginger component with with a lighter lemon flavor.  It is a sweet drink. though not quite as sweet as many sodas.<br /><br />I prepared the powdered drink as directed with 250ml (1 cup) of hot water.  The granules in the packet dissolved quickly and the resulting beverage is actually a tannish brown color.<br /><br />I am just getting over a sore throat and I can see how a hot drink like this might be soothing and clear our my nose when I have a cold.  I certainly felt the ginger making a spicy burning sensation in the back of my throat.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get this drink again. but it's not bad. either.  Those who are big fans of very strong and spicy ginger flavor would probably like it.<br /><br />Usually I'd probably prefer something like a ginger ale. or if I have a cold. hot tea or broth.<br /><br />One funny aspect about receiving this drink was that Amazon shipped me my packet of ginger drink in a giant box something like 20x16x8 (with air padding packs).  This is for a small packet of drink that could easily fit in a padded envelope.  I'm not sure if this was because they were out of smaller packing or if they thought I needed a large box for returning something.  It was pretty comical when I opened a huge box and saw the small packet of drink mix in the middle.
45743,B0041NYV8E,A26KSESH1KXU3Q,K G R K G R,0/0,1327708800,Mixed impressions,I found this ginger-lemon tea to be so-so. Although I mixed the powder and water quite well. I found the taste inconsistent.  Some sips had an overpowering ginger taste.  Other times the flavor was more moderate and the lemon taste was reflected.  In the end. I found that this had too strong of an aftertaste. a sensation similar to that experienced with some artificial sweeteners.  If you like Gold-kilis other products. or if you like very strong ginger flavored drinks. this is for you.  If not. you may wish to try another product.
45754,B0041NYV8E,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,W. Oliver,0/0,1327449600,Overpowering ginger,The instructions on the packet say to pour hot water over the drink mix but it doesn't mention the amount. I used a typical coffee mug size cup full of hot water and poured it over the mix in a separate cup. The ginger odor is highly evident the minute you open the packet. The mix dissolves immediately as soon as the water hits it. The drink itself was way too powerful for me to drink. The ginger was overpowering and it burned my throat. I think the drink might be better with less mix but as the instructions were rather vague. I wasn't sure how to use it. Like many of the other reviewers. I did not detect the lemon flavor.
45755,B0041NYV8E,A2561PYW9TTMYD,Lori Calabrese &34;Children's Books Examiner...,0/0,1327449600,73 calories per cup and 16 grams of sugar!,Wow! As soon as I poured some hot water over this instant drink mix. the smell of ginger was very noticeable. I thought the aroma was very pleasant and enjoyable. As for taste. you don't notice the lemon. but the ginger is very strong and packs a very strong spicy bite! If you love ginger. you will enjoy this drink. but if you dislike the taste of even a ginger snap cookie. steer clear.<br /><br />Although I liked this drink. I was disappointed with the nutritional information. Although it's all natural. 1 sachet equals 73 calories and contains 16 grams of sugar! That's a lot for a cup of tea! I'll stick with either Tazo Green Ginger Tea or The Mate Factor's Yerba Mate lemon ginger. You still get that ginger flavor without the added calories and sugar!
45770,B0041NYV8E,ADYZOSTF9LZLD,Shawna Lanne Book,1/2,1334793600,refreshing and aromatic,I enjoyed this quite a bit and found the flavor rich and full and the aroma ( always important) was wonderful.  I would recommend this and will purchase it again (or rather purchase a box and not just try a sample.) I was not bothered by the aftertaste (and there is one) and had it cold..
45780,B0041NYV8E,A2R80172BBNSTA,J. Miller multi-user,1/2,1331769600,Very Unique Beverage,I am not quite sure what I was expecting when I opened the first package. It was a unique taste but one I grew to like very quickly. Now I drink this as a special treat. Love the fact that it is all natural. So tired of the products that have chemical names I could never pronounce as ingredients.
45788,B0041NYV8E,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,Honest,1/2,1328659200,No. Never. No,The only thing I can think about this drink is that it has to do something positive for the body to taste this terrible. I thought it was going to be a nice light beverage like herbal tea. I was wrong. It's thicker (and yes. I used the right amount of water). It may have been better if it were carbonated but that's a long shot too.<br /><br />This rates as the worst taste experience of my life. Seriously.
45797,B0041NYV8E,A1EZLLHWJULK2K,Coolfire,1/2,1327536000,Surprisingly spicy. but interesting,Interesting and surprising flavor.  Mix with 1 cup hot water.  Color a light mustard brown.  What is immediately noticeable when swallowed is that it is rather surprisingly spicy.  In fact. it leaves a distinct jalapeno type hotness on the lounge and throat.  I gave it three stars as I found the degree of spiciness after taste a bit more than I would prefer in this type drink.
45806,B0041NYV8E,AM83WJG9BE2EP,Mary,2/4,1334707200,Well. at least it was free,The smell was fabulous--a scent of ginger and lemon that was very appealing. But then I tasted it. Bitter with an overpowering ginger flavor. I'll admit it--I have a serious sweet tooth and generally have to add additional honey to my drink to make it palatable. However. I'm not sure there's enough honey in my cabinet for this drink.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this as an alternative for my tea-drinking self but. unfortunately. this drink was not for me.<br /><br />On the plus side. it did dissolve quickly and completely with no graininess.
45836,B0041NYV8E,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,Conner Macleod Afficionado,0/1,1334620800,Interesting But Too Spicy,I must say I was excited to try this product because it sounded like a unique and tasty combination of flavors. but it didn't quite live up to what I had hoped for.  I enjoy the flavor of ginger as well as lemon by themselves but had never put the two together. although it makes sense if it's made right because they can balance each other with the right combination of quantities. a mix of bitter. sweet and sour.  The flavor of the ginger in this instance definitely over-powered the lemon and was just altogether way too potent for my taste buds.  This may be to the liking of those who like or can handle really spicy foods but this disagreed with my sensibility.  I measured it right with 250 ml of water (about an 8 oz. cup) and I tried it both hot and cold but it was too powerful either way.  Now if they greatly reduced the amount of ginger and focused on the lemon with just a hint of ginger. they'd be onto something. but as it stands it's quite simply too strong.  The amount of lemon was just fine but someone dropped the ball when mixing it with ginger.  I like the concept but it needs more work before it's perfected.
45854,B0041NYV8E,A341D838USLGKM,Daniel Greene,0/1,1333843200,Spicy. Sweet and Satisfying,I enjoy hot ginger drinks and this by far is my most favorite. First. let me say that I don't think this drink is for everyone. I. myself. wouldn't drink this as often as I drink coffee. But if you're ever in the mood for a hot. spicy. yet sweet beverage. I strongly recommend this mix. What's nice about it is that it's not an exotic blend of a variety of flavors; rather it's a simple. straightforward ginger with honey drink. Furthermore. though I don't want to overstate its possible medicinal properties by committing the fallacy of confusing correlation with causation; nevertheless. I drank this when I felt I was coming down with a cold but by the next day I felt much better.<br /><br />I very much encourage you to try this enjoyable and tasty drink.
45863,B0041NYV8E,A1I477ADGMLVJM,D. Matlack Guidedog,0/1,1332720000,An aquired taste - which I could not  develop.,I'm actually a fan of ginger gum and familiar with the sharp spiciness of ginger. however this was a little much. Based on the warm golden liquid featured in the mug on the box I was actually surprised that the actual color is a deep opaque brown with an extremely pungent smell.<br /><br />As for taste it is sweet yet quite strong. Tho' the taste was not altogether unpleasant my tongue and my throat were burned. Not as in the liquid was too hot but as in it was too spicy for me.<br /><br />People who win chili contests would probably find this refreshing.
45879,B0041NYV8E,A3R5GTYQ50QVMD,M. Gravel,0/1,1328486400,Bad Aftertaste!,Way to powdery tasting and bad aftertaste.  Plus the price I could not believe for this junk!  Skip and stay with Countrytime Lemonade!<br /><br />Yuck!
45881,B0041NYV8E,A1OMHUU58XHQNG,SKY2110 SKY2110,0/1,1328227200,80 calories per cup,I love this tea or at least I did when I first tried it. It has a very effervescent. gingery kinda taste. Now I think my taste buds have gone numb to the stuff. And it's about 80 calories per cup. which is way too much for a cup of tea...really. So I will probably use it only once in a blue moon. But. no worries. each tea bag is nicely sealed in an aluminum paper-like bag which are all then sealed again in a larger aluminum paper-like bag. I'm tell'in you this stuff could last through the Great Tribulation and still be fresh.
45889,B0041NYV8E,ASF0R1CMSF26F,A. Burke,0/2,1335312000,Pleasantly surprised,I was a bit skeptical of this Gold Kili lemon & ginger beverage. but I'm always willing to try out a hot drink which is so easy to make. Upon opening the packet there is a very strong ginger smell. and this translates into a very strong ginger taste. I could really taste the ginger in the back of my throat. and I thought it was actually quite pleasant. I know that If I had a sore throat. it would feel great. The lemon taste comes through too. but not nearly as noticeable as the ginger.<br /><br />This beverage is very much like an instant tea. however it contains no actual tea leaves (thus no caffeine either). It's not as good as a freshly brewed ginger/lemon tea. but it still tastes pretty good. It's also much more convenient. Overall. I was pleasantly surprised.
45899,B0041NYV8E,AHKPZ11JT110F,amazonbuyer,3/4,1328486400,Very stong on the ginger!,I only used about one third of the little packet in my mug and then used hot water. I like ginger so I was happy with the strong flavor. I am also going to add it to my homemade lemonade for a little kick. In lieu of full disclosure. I tasted absolutely no lemon in the beverage.<br /><br />This is pre-sweetened. The little bag I received did not have the ingredient list. so I don't know which sweetener was used. I will say it did not seem to have the funny after-feel in my mouth and throat that I get from artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />If you are a ginger person. you will enjoy this immensely. It is a great morning drink.
45912,B0041NYV8E,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,Shannie Shan,2/3,1334016000,Not too much lemon. good ginger flavor,<span class=tiny> Length:: 1:13 Mins<br /><br /></span>I wish Amazon would allow a longer video so I could share the entire experience. This drink is somewhat complex if you can taste beyond the huge ginger impact of it. First there is a sweet honey-ish warmth. followed by an almost immediate rush of ginger. Next is a pepper-y taste and feel as and after it goes down. The pepper stays on the front of the mouth and the back of the throat for quite a while. Very little lemon. There is enough sweetness to be able to stand up to a healthy squeeze from a lemon wedge. Adding more water made it less intense. but was still a bit too sweet. If you enjoy a spicy sweet hot beverage. and love ginger. this might be a favorite for you.
45914,B0041NYV8E,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,Tate,2/3,1333065600,Well I think it's delicious...,All the haters on here calling this tea disgusting and cold medicine-like must be newbies to Ginger. I understand that ginger has a very spicy. in-your-face flavor. and it certainly isn't for everybody. but for those of us who DO like the taste. please don't be turned off by some of the more nasty reviews. Personally. I think this tea is delicious.<br /><br />Each packet contains an unique mix of ginger. lemon. and honey that instantly dissolves in hot water. No messy tea bags necessary. Once poured. you are immediately greeted with a lovely aroma--and once tasted. you are immediately transformed to a safe. warm place. It is spicy. It has tang. But it's perfectly sweetened with soothing honey (and a small hint of lemon) and the result. in my opinion. is one of the most good feeling teas I've ever drank. I wasn't sick when I tried it. but I felt 1000x better after drinking a cup. It was weird. I felt fine. and then I felt so much better!<br /><br />I've heard ginger has lots of natural heeling properties. especially when a cold pops up. From now on I think I'm going to be keeping this in my medicine cabinet as well as my regular cabinet. It's a delicious drink for any occasion.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you have to buy a 6-pack...
45922,B0041NYV8E,A11EIDY6DD40CS,Peregrinn,2/3,1328140800,Ginger heat soothes my throat.  I like it!,Only get this product if you love ginger!  There is a heat to this drink that soothes a sore throat.  Like the Ginger Chews I buy at Trader Joe's. this is not for the faint-hearted who think of gingerbread when they hear ginger.  It is seriously spicy.  I hope you like it as much as I do!
45923,B0041NYV8E,A73DFWJE0CGY6,Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) Exiled Yankee,2/3,1327622400,Pretty potent stuff,I didn't feel well this morning. and went into the kitchen. and there was the packet of Gold Kili Lemon Ginger drink mix. Lemon and Ginger is just the thing for an iffy stomach. so I put on the hot pot and got the tea water going.<br /><br />When I opened the envelope. it wasn't quite what I was expecting; I think I had a powdery substance in mind. The product here is granular. and dissolves immediately upon hitting the hot water. I let it steep for a minute or so (don't know if that's recommended or not) and I must say. it is a powerfully gingery drink. It did clear my head. and as ginger will do. it heated up my mouth a lot too.<br /><br />It might be a nice item to keep on hand for times when you don't feel well. It did make me feel better. Next time I might put it in a slightly larger mug. though; it is VERY potent.
45931,B0041NYV8E,A36RJG7HHV45TQ,Sterghe,0/0,1351123200,Ginger. and what's the aftertaste?,I like this drink.<br /><br />But. I LOVE ginger. This has a strong ginger taste. and I think that's great. If you're more accustomed to the bland idea of a hint of ginger in some salad dressing or Asian food. then taste the real thing. straight up. first. If you don't love ginger. you will not like this product. And yes. it's a little spicy--that's the ginger!<br /><br />Next. I know that honey is more natural and sounds wholesome and everything. but it's just not my favorite sweetener. Whatever they do to powder it. along with the other sweeteners listed on the label. gives it kind of a weird aftertaste. Ginger itself is kind of sweet. and the bit of lemon is a good complement. but the aftertaste here is just weird.<br /><br />I actually think I'll go back to dumping plain old real ginger into a cup of tea. despite the need to strain the cup or ignore the dregs. for the taste I love. It's not as convenient as the little packet. but it does taste better.<br /><br />(Why three stars? It's not terrible. and was maybe even good; it's just not great.)
45934,B0041NYV8E,A3M2O06MCHJG18,Donald P. Martin Jr. d_p_m_j,0/0,1347321600,Perhaps a hit for chai lovers or cold-sufferers. though not exactly my cup of tea,I have to admit; I have a cup of this beverage right in front of me. piping hot. and I as my three-year old son would say. this is not my favorite.<br /><br />(And this is where we say. BUT.)<br /><br />But the poor showing of three stars I am giving this product is truly based off of the way I perceive the taste... My palate has never liked those hard honey candies that some people -- like my Dad -- adore. and that's the prime flavor I pick our instantly.  The same honey sweetness is right there on the front line of the palate.  But there are things that even I like about the product; the ginger taste soon separates itself from the honey flavor. and the after-swallow finish is very spicy. like cloves. and remains strong for some time.  It's strong spiciness does reach beyond your palate and into your sinuses - I can see this as being an excellent beverage for someone who has a cold (sore throat especially) and is looking for a zippy drink for relief.<br /><br />Also. I can see adding a shot of your favorite brandy or spiced rum to this drink to make it one of those special toddies you allow yourself in those winter times when the sniffles have got you.  In those times. I imagine even my taste buds would appreciate a Gold Kili Ginger Lemon Toddy in a hot bath.  :^)
45947,B0041NYV8E,A3J6V6FWETLBDU,aliled aliled,0/0,1340755200,I like it a lot . . .,In quite a lot of the world. ginger is used as a quasi-medicinal agent in foods and beverages.  It's delicious and adds a pit of heat to everything from curries to hot tea.  I've been a fan for some time. but frankly. ginger is kind of a pain to deal with on a casual basis - it dries out if not consumed fairly quickly. it's difficult to peel and it's not always available at the local grocery store.<br /><br />I especially miss it in a late night tea.  There's something about it I find relaxing. and this product fills that need without a lot of mess.  The lemon / ginger / honey bland tastes great.  The Gold Kili brand is widely touted as a digestion aid (as ginger is in general). and though I can't claim any problems with digestion (!). I do like to brew a bit to enjoy with Thai or Indian food.  My only complaint about his product is that it's a bit on the expensive side (as I write this.)  Otherwise. it's definitely worth a try.
45956,B0012ZQPWY,A36Y4XHEHNGZ7B,ArmyWife76,0/0,1312934400,Sweet Sauce!,My husband and I both really like this BBQ sauce.  To me. it is more on the sweet side then the spicy side.  If you like your BBQ sauce sweet then you will like this sauce.
45957,B0012ZQPWY,A2C6HYAPKIXKTC,Qwiinke Girl Qwiinke Girl,0/1,1293926400,Great spicy sauce! (Not a BBQ sauce),This sauce is great on almost everything!  We love it on eggs. chicken. etc. But so far. all of the sellers that I see here are charging WAY TOO MUCH money for shipping!  I for one. will refrain from buying any until the shipping and handling is more reasonable. The cost[...] is WAY high.  At stores. its around [...] so to add this shipping is really robbery.
45968,B001EO7GQC,AAUICTIUBVU7R,Roy Berger Everyman,0/0,1345593600,GREAT,I love grapefruit and this combines slicesof that fruit and orange slices in a sweet juice. Yummy yum yum. I was under impression I could not have grapefruit because it negated my prescription drugs. but learned on Google that is wrong.
45999,B00448Q6UC,A6MCGGRCW1PAM,Snapshot Sally,0/0,1344211200,Smells great & gentle on puppy's digestive system,After suspecting that a protein intolerance was at the root of my newly-adopted puppy's month-long diarrhea episode. I began to research different puppy foods. No amount of antibiotics & prescription food was fixing his mysteriously loose and bloody bowel movements.<br /><br />Puppy had been eating a high-quality pet food based on the diet of canines in the wild. I have no issues with that brand. but it certainly wasn't right for my pup. I needed to find a low-protein puppy food that did not include beef or chicken.<br /><br />...Keen is the perfect fit. It is low protein and uses turkey as its protein source. The organic ingredients and simple ingredients list was a huge plus.<br /><br />The first bowl I made for pupster made me HUNGRY - it smells so good! Just like camping food for people.<br /><br />I use this food. combined with another lamb-based food specifically for puppies with allergies. This is due to the cost & amount that puppies eat.<br /><br />His stools are now great and he goes positively ape-shiz when I start mixing his food. I DEFINITELY recommend this product.
46050,B001EO5QZK,A2OOGNEEW60IQ,M. Bolin,5/5,1169510400,Good value but.....,This tea has a very grassy. vegetal taste and smell. which can be good or bad depending on your preference.
46068,B001EO5QZK,A35OD1RKGX6RJK,foamweapons,2/2,1195430400,Great Green Tea,I've tried many green teas in the same price range. but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light. vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas. and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint. jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself. plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer. I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder. and recommend this tea instead.
46078,B001EO5QZK,AT0IKAJJBC86V,kis simplicity,1/1,1261526400,Great Coffee Substitute,Coffee was killing my stomach so I went in search of a healthy organic alternative to my morning ritual and discovered this little treasure.  The jasmine is strong and the green tea is superb.  And. with less caffeine in my life. I am a much nicer person (chuckle).
46081,B001EO5QZK,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,B. Davis The Happy Hermit,1/1,1216771200,Good stuff!!,Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea. good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.  I drink the first mug straight and the rest I put soy milk powder in.  GOOD STUFF.  Will continue to buy this tea.

46198,B002ZF5QZC,AG52DCCRB5HK8,Rebecca Kwilinski,1/1,1318550400,Great bones!!,The quality on the bones I have been buying have been going down hill. I decided to try these and love them. We cut them in half for a great dog treat. They last much longer than the bones we have been purchasing. I will keep buying these for my dogs. I hope the quality stays the same. Keep up the good product..and the price is right..

These show no sign of ever being chewed.<br /><br />I don't know why. but I have tripped over so many at this point (and I've only used one of the two bags) .... I doubt I would ever buy again.

My mom got me hooked on them when I was little and I have not stopped loving them. I have only seen them at one or two stores but they dont carry them regularly so when I found them here. I just had to have them. I like the small boxes. It reminds me when I used to get them from an ice cream truck and they are the perfect serving size when I want I treat.

46258,B0000DGG4Y,A7IKOAH6M8WAC,Eric,11/12,1207612800,Not Exactly what I Expected,First off. my true gut feeling on the rating is a three.  I am giving it a four because the I think the company is really good. the product was shipped fast and was packed really well.  I am not super happy with the Trident Maple Forest but I am not totally disappointed either.  I really didn't know what to expect since this item had not been reviewed before. I couldn't find too many photos. and I have never ordered anything that is alive on the internet.<br /><br />My main disappointment is probably due to my own ignorance with bonsais.  I have had a few various bonsais before and have sadly killed them all.  I had seen the Trident Forest in a brochure before and really wanted it awhile ago.  The idea of a mini forest sounded really neat.  I also love maple trees so it really seemed perfect.  When I received my bonsai today I was a little disappointed when I saw the trees.  Basically they look like someone cut tree limbs off a maple tree and put them into a pot.  Now. that may be how bonsai trees are made and I just don't know.  I thought that maybe these were mini trees that were grown from a seed and pruned and trained to be small.  But. as I said. I don't know much about bonsais.  I am also disappointed in that I read when making a forest one should really try not to put the trees in any order or try to make them symmetrical.  My forest is almost arranged in a perfect oval shape.  Also. the largest tree is very loose and feels like it may pop out of the soil any moment.  So. some of my trees look like a stick off a tree with maybe 10 small leaves on them and the top of the tree pruned diagonally.<br /><br />Now. am I planning on returning the product?  No. probably not unless it starts looking sick in the next two weeks or one of the trees falls out of the pot.  I think it is a cute bonsai and am hoping I can take really good care of it and get it to grow some more leaves and fill out.  To be honest. if I had seen this in a store for 100 dollars I would not have ever considered buying it.<br /><br />So I am giving it a four because it was shipped fast and packed really well.  It only lost about 10 leaves which I think is pretty good.  Some of the leaves are wilted but I am assuming it is because of them being in the dark box for a few days.  I also don't want to rate the tree too low because I really didn't know what to expect so I want to be fair to the product and company.  I also love the leaves that is does have.<br /><br />I took photos of it packed. me unpacking it. and the tree by itself.  I am hoping to post these photos on amazon.  I hope this helps you decide if you want one.  Like I said. it is small and cute but definitely not like the photo posted on amazon.  It is not thick with leaves or stems but this may be due to the season.  Oh. and my tallest tree is 13 inches from the soil to the top of the stick.

46323,B002GJ9JWS,A1AOMLAMYYJ3NZ,kal,1/1,1325808000,I thought it was too good to be true.,I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter. it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side. why I gave it 4 stars. is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter. but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories. I consider it worth it.
46361,B002GJ9JWS,A27WMCFVVBSO2K,K. Winslow,1/1,1313020800,Always Good,I have ordered this multiple times. Peanut Butter is a favorite of mine. however it is not friendly to my nutrition plan. PB2 is a great solution. PB2 has great peanut flavor. yet does not have that heavy oily feeling in my stomach. With 85% less fat and calories I can enjoy a favorite food without the guilt or damage to my health.
46374,B002GJ9JWS,AOFMKFQLJCAK9,Reader,1/1,1266796800,PB2,I love this product.  If you love PB but never purchase a jar because you could eat an entire jar in a day or 2. this product is for you.  I loved FitzNuts PB until I bought PB2.  It is superior.  I have it on apples or cabbage.  I don't overeat it because you have to mix it up - takes seconds - with water.  I have even used it in recipes that call for 1/4 cup PB.  It works fine.<br />Just remember. it is not PB.  If you are a die-hard PB Connoisseur. this may not be for you but if you love PB but want something with less calories and fat. PB2 is for you!
46411,B002GJ9JWS,AD5DQ0L56ZKD0,ChelseaT,0/0,1345593600,Amazing!,Woah...wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is. honestly. When mixed with water. the consistency is a dead ringer for regular peanut butter and the taste is spot on. I was expecting bland. chalky paste but it definitely is nothing like that. MMM! So good! Excited to try it in/on everything!! If you're on the fence. just give it a try. For way under $10. and way under the regular fat content of regular peanut butter. this stuff is a god-send!
46418,B002GJ9JWS,A3NC5N4MVVXGSL,Matt,0/0,1343952000,Fantastic,Excellent product. Tastes great even if you don't mix it with water. Great way to eat peanut butter. Price is really the biggest issue with the product.
46419,B002GJ9JWS,A363C53T0YCN1Q,prettyface,0/0,1343865600,Guiltless,I really like the flavor. not exactly like real peanut butter but still tasty. And I don't feel bad about eating it like I do when I eat 10 grams of fat on regular peanut butter. I do agree with the previous review. price is high especially since it doesn't last as long as the regular PB. Although there always seems to be a higher price on unique products like this one. I bought both the original PB and Chocolate PB. I like original better. I'll buy it again.
46433,B002GJ9JWS,A1STQIBBBO05U8,flygirlcourt,0/0,1341964800,Good alternative!,I would say it doesn't taste 100% like regular peanut butter. but its definitely a great substitute! Can't wait to try it in recipes. I tried another reviewer's tip to add a little jelly for a classic PB&J spread - it was amazing!
46436,B002GJ9JWS,A3OFQ9J5GGLQBK,Michelle,0/0,1341187200,Yum!,I am a peanut butter fanatic. but it was hard to eat a lot of it & stay within my calorie limits for the day. I was looking for a substitute that wasn't going to taste nasty and leave a weird aftertaste & I cam across PB2! I love the simple peanuty taste & it goes great in smoothies & in yogurt as well. Love this on a piece of whole wheat toast!
46444,B002GJ9JWS,A27FY4T850V4HC,Tiger paw Joe,0/0,1339286400,Shocked at how good this is,Not sure what I expected. but certainly not something that tastes darn near as good as peanut butter.  Seriously. other than the work of having to add some water and measure it out. it mixes remarkably easy and tastes fantastic.  Love this stuff.  I'm ordering the chocolate now too to see how it is.
46458,B002GJ9JWS,A1FVJULCX11GXM,Ryan R Myers,0/0,1335398400,Great is Smoothies and even by iteslf,I bought this mostly to add into protein smoothies for some extra PB flavor without all the fat and calories. It works perfect for that! 2 tablespoons of this added to some protein powder in a smoothie tastes just like I've added regular peanut butter.  I've also tried mixing one tablespoon of PB2 with one tablespoon of water and it also tastes pretty good (though not quite as rich as regular pb). The consistency comes out just like peanut butter and you can use it for sandwiches or dipping.
46460,B002GJ9JWS,A2HDK6H1UDXASX,Olga Figueroa,0/0,1335139200,Love the lowfat peanut butter,I really love this product!  It taste so good without all the fat and heart burn.  I like to mix it with strawberry jelly. equal parts and spread on my toast.  It has only 1.5 g of fat while peanut butter has 17g/ serving.  It is a guilty pleasure with little fat and calories.
46470,B002GJ9JWS,A3T8YYQXKGXD0G,Carol K Everson,0/0,1330473600,PB2 - Peanut Protein Powder,PB2 is great.  A serving. 2 T of powder. is 1 point on Weight Watcher's Points Plus system.  Mixed with a tablespoon of water it makes something like peanut butter.  But even better is adding it to soups or smoothies for that peanut taste.
46489,B002GJ9JWS,A1SQTLFHMO6J5J,Jennifer Strange sugar wips,0/0,1327449600,So delicious!,Wow. I am so surprised & impressed by this product! When mixed w/ water it really does taste like regular peanut butter. We are used to the natural PB anyway. which prob has less sodium than say. regular JIF. It's really good! I tasted it by itself because I wanted to see what it truly tasted like without crackers or bread to mask the taste. No aftertaste. totally delicious... really yummy! 3 thumbs up!
46492,B002GJ9JWS,A2KX0MR43C0H10,Tisha,0/0,1326758400,YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!,This is the first time I have ever written a review.  This stuff is AMAZING.  Truly! Try it.. you will LOVE it!
46498,B002GJ9JWS,A1215UUO1UMVCR,Dedikit,0/0,1326153600,Delicious,Needed something to add to my protein shakes (vanilla) besides strawberries.  I have heard about this product but was hesitant on if it actually tastes like peanut butter.......UNBELIEVABLE taste!! Tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter!  Buy it.  You won't regret it.
46512,B002GJ9JWS,AMX1EDPUW8J58,Erica K,5/5,1314144000,Great taste. but measure by weight not volume,I was very impressed with the taste of this peanut butter. After playing around a bit with the water to powder ratio. I got a smooth creamy spread that was fantastic on a piece of bread.<br /><br />Be sure to measure out the amount you want by weight. not volume. I am dinging them one star because their serving size is 21g or 2 tbps. I found that 21g came out a bit over 1 tbps. but it is definitely not 2! Since most people are likely buying this to watch their calories. that's a big error. You still end up with enough to comfortably cover a piece of bread.
46518,B002GJ9JWS,A1KCULTG8DPCJ5,sigandann,1/2,1319846400,PB2,Oh my goodness!!! This is the best!!! It has passed all the tastes tests in our house and beyond.

You will not be disappointed!!!!<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJ9JWS>PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz</a>
46524,B002GJ9JWS,AT8MYBBLMZZ8A,Neil Janin,0/1,1346457600,Good but not the real thing,I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality. if you follow the instructions.<br /><br />However. it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter. especially the commercial ones such as Jiff. Skippy. etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way. since it doesn't have the fat.<br /><br />I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.
46556,B002GJ9JWS,AACJX2ZYTQATW,Normynne,5/6,1255651200,Good stuff!,This product is wonderful. It becomes real peanut butter by just mixing with a little water. but without all the fat of grocery story peanut butter.<br />when we eat bananas. we often dip the banana into a little dry peanut butter. Delicious. Medical specialists urge people to eat some nuts every day. so this product fits the bill.
46566,B002GJ9JWS,A2IIMX1CS0TIE9,Trist,2/2,1323302400,So Good why isn't it Bad???,After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter. for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it. I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this. which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it. so it's not quite like regular PB. you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water. but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free. I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the bowl of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that. it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too. and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand. I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream. but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot. but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping. at least so far. it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all. I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon. just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However. rather than just throw it all out. I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know. heated up. it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus. since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention. if you're lactose intolerant like me. regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat. so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence. I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called netrition.com and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else. but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon. but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much. or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said. Amazon is great for most things. but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!
46586,B002GJ9JWS,AHDOV721XZ7DG,doctormom,2/2,1306627200,Yum!,This is great stuff!  You can use in place of peanut butter in lots of ways and the calorie difference really helps the waistline!  The flavor is just like peanut butter - I sprinkle on top of a piece of toast with fruit spread and it tastes like peanut butter and jelly!  Also use it in wraps for a thai flavor and in smoothies - yum!
46598,B002GJ9JWS,A2U28V57CPSP9E,M. Runge,1/1,1349481600,Great taste. less fat!,I was leery about buying this product. but I decided to give it a try anyway. It's great. and a lot less fat for those who would like eat to peanut butter more frequently than its natural fat content allows. It tastes like a natural peanut butter brand. not like a Skippy or Jif. I like to add 1 teaspoon of honey to it sometimes. Be aware that 1 serving of prepared PB2 is not the same amount as a TBSP of peanut butter. it is a little less.
46619,B003ZS4FXM,A3MOUVN8OBENLF,Gin13,0/0,1331337600,Yoohoo Chocolate Drink,Bought for grandkids. they love this stuff.<br />Large package was a hit with them.<br /><br />It was a great price for a pack of 32.<br />When they have another sale price of this item I will<br />buy again.

The pods are individually wrapped for freshness and the pods fit nicely in the Senseo pod holder. I prefer a light roast. so this is one of several varieties I rotate through.

The Amazon Marketplace special that I took advantage of recently offered free delivery and I picked up the parcel within a few days at my branch post office.

46711,B000RI3SKY,A2ZKF3UU1TF14L,Heather D. Gallay,1/1,1214524800,Miraculous,Two of my middle-aged cats have shown signs of stiffness in one of their hind legs. I decided to give them Cosequin. a highly recommended supplement for joint health in cats and dogs.<br /><br />One of my cats is a pig and will eat anything that's not nailed down. so I knew giving him the supplement would be a fairly easy process; however. the other cat is very picky and will only eat dry food (he's not even interested in cat treats). so I was concerned that giving him the Cosequin would be an impossible task.<br /><br />Enter Greenies Pill Pockets (chicken flavored). Skittles (the finicky cat) went nuts the second I introduced them. I stuck a capsule inside a Pill Pocket and he snarfed it down at top speed. then started looking for more. And it's been that way ever since. For the first time ever. my cats actually look forward to getting their medication every day! (In fact. the other two cats who aren't receiving medication try to sneak a Pill Pocket every now and then.)<br /><br />The only thing I would caution is that the pockets are fairly small. Cosequin capsules. for example. can be opened and sprinkled on food or into a pocket -- but it took about three pockets to hold one capsule's worth of powder. Thus. I've had to keep the capsule intact. pushing it through the pocket so that it sticks out on both ends. That said. my cats still inhale it like it's the best thing they've ever tasted.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all cat families. This product works miracles.

The price quoted $10.23 for shipping but when I got the email confirmation I was charged $26.49 to have it sent to an APO for a grand total of $47.00 for 4 bags of chips. 12.00 per bag of chips?????? Rediculous. I haven't even got them yet and unless every chip is unbroken this was a total waste of money. I'll go back to bugging the ex and get a suprise gift of candy for alot less. I know this is to rate an item but until they come up with rate a seller this will have to do.

Being from England. she always had something interesting. But. her favorite and mine was her mint jelly. She always made her own. and we ate it on toasted English Muffins. The muffins would always be crunchy and the mint jelly always seemed to wake you up. perk you up. for whatever she had planed to do that day. I've searched for mint jelly for some time before I realized that is was pretty rare in today's stores.  But. when I came across the Maple Grove Jelly. made with real mint. Well. I must admit. I bought a whole carton.  My husband thought I was nuts. but. now he's tried it. and every other day. I have to put a new jar out.
46757,B001EQ4SHK,AWJIDYMBMI55D,Aaron Alter,31/32,1220140800,This blend is not the same as the Special Dark of a few years ago.,Although this cocoa is called Special Dark. it isn't the same Special Dark cocoa of a few years ago.  The previous Special Dark was 100% Dutched Cocoa. while the current Special Dark is a blend of Dutched and Natural Cocoas. so it isn't as dark or as strong as the previous one.  It is very good and has a pleasant fruity taste as compared to the more bitter and richer cocoa taste of its predecessor.  Initially I preferred the previous Special Dark. but am getting used to the new blend. The price is very good.
46760,B001EQ4SHK,A1CODWMRUALCG,BetterWays BetterWays,5/5,1278720000,Best Cocoa for drinking,I've been drinking this for several years and just looked on Amazon because lately it's not available in any of my supermarkets.  It's value is that it is half natural cocoa which is extremely high in antioxidents and half dutch processed which dissolves and blends well.  I can just stir in a teaspoon full into plain hot water for a healthy. delicious bitter cocoa drink. Way better than coffee.<br /><br />The only things that could make it any better is being organic and from fair trade sources.
46779,B001EQ4SHK,A2PBWNSINVW87,DI_Mom,0/0,1340928000,My go-to cocoa,I love Hershey's Special Dark for all of my baking and other treat needs.  Great flavor and results in a very dark finished product that looks great with white or colored frosting. fruit. etc.  I am so glad I can buy it here because I haven't been able to find it in a grocery store for several years.

46837,B00474N5N4,A2CVX7MH84N3QI,Bambi Castleman,0/0,1324598400,Good stuff!,I bought a case of this sauce for my husband.  He loves it!  I like it but it's a little warm for my taste.  He bought his first bottle at a major retail store then went back for more and they didn't have it so I found it on Amazon.  I got just what I was supposed to in 2 days (prime membership). Now hubby is a happy camper.
46855,B002Z95BOY,A3OJODCRBTTF51,D. Spaulding,0/1,1276128000,Horrible,Tastes like the can. much better in the little aseptic cartons.  Really tastes awful. nothing like VitaCoCo.  Thought I would save money by buying this one. now I know why it costs so much less.  If you love coconut water. don't waste your money on this one. And. yes. I know it has lime added. I always add a squeeze of fresh lime juice to my coconut water.  This doesn't taste fresh or clean or sweet. it tastes old and sour.  Horrible.
46864,B003V7XNRQ,A22FK47N45T54I,The Film Master omnifilmaster,1/1,1326153600,An Aquired Taste,This is a decent product. but I have a lot of texture issues.  The flavor is light and buttery. but not as sweet as I expected.  The sweetness was almost imperceptible.<br /><br />The previous reviews concerning manna were true in that the product does separate.  Re-mixing for was not a problem.<br /><br />The texture issues are that when eating it raw the initially it is smooth and creamy. but soon becomes thick and grainy.  The graininess makes it difficult for me to eat it off a spoon.<br /><br />I have tried mixing it in vegetables and curries and you can still get hints of the graininess.  The product also will solidify after it cools despite using it in cooked a dish.

Only without the extra junk in the other types of cereal.  I eat this with my Vanilla Light Soymilk.  It is great.
46921,B001P4H57Q,A10TOPD17GRVNG,esskayee,2/2,1314316800,Better than the original boxes even,The popcorn is fresher and fluffier than I remember.  And there are enough peanuts to add that something extra that plain caramel corn doesn't have. The bags are a good size for a snack.
46963,B004K0630W,A3QE6W49BZY8YJ,K. A. Woods,0/0,1342742400,My all-time favorite,Since I bought my Dolce Gusto machine I have tried 9 different varieties of capsules. and the caramel latte is the one I buy over and over.  It smells intoxicating when you brew it and has a delicious caramel flavor. and I'm convinced there is a speck of cinnamon in it as well. It is not overly sweet. so I add sweetener. I have also been known to ramp up the flavor with Coffee Mate caramel or even vanilla or hazelnut. This coffee plays well with other flavors! I really wish they would introduce a bigger variety of capsules. but until that happens. caramel latte will be my favorite.

I still don't know. probably because I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />My unhealthy habit 25: snacking.  I've loved to snack on Gold Fish since I was a kid.<br /><br />These were scrumptious and a bit better for me nutritiously than the standard Gold Fish (not by much).  The price on these are pretty high (hence the 4 star) compared to the regular but I will probably buy these again because they are just that good; have a bit more crunch and substance.  I still love the Fishes!

47011,B0018S09TK,A29313797NGT9L,Eddie Wannabee,1/3,1276041600,Love It!,I have nothing but praises for this product. Call me naive. call me a pasta lover. but I am firmly bought on the idea that this is a low carb pasta and prefer to not dispute the fact or second guess it. I love pasta. always have. always will! But since time does take a toll and careless living does have a consequence I ended being basically blocked from regular pasta. By basically I mean. that once I got a little smarter. I realized that most of my eating habits would have to change If I ever was to conquer my limitations. It was either or and going back to my many meals of italian origin. be that canneloni. lasag&ntilde;a. a la bolognesi. tutu di mare. pesto. I can go on and on and get hungry at the exact same time. The point is that Dreamfields Pasta (with such a beautiful name it can be the pasta of dreams) offers me a way out or should I rephrase and say: I way in. Man Oh Mama Mia. pasta a la alfredo. just with parmesan and butter (for me I can't believe it's not butter for the rest the real deal from the cow's mouth!) pasta primavera...I better stop! I am getting emotional and my eyes are heating up! With the upcoming Wonderfully Exciting FIFA World Cup 2010 and the beautiful first days of Summer Dreamfields Pasta appear like the saviors in a market that mostly ignore the needs. of perhaps the few. but never the less active. dedicated. and deserving as anyone else to enjoy life at its fullest! I hope this is the best of all world cups ever and I give 5 Stars to the only kid in town!
47024,B001E5E3B2,A1KSQOZY8AFWUJ,Paul,5/5,1184284800,My 1st choice in raisin bran for 60 years,The wisdom in the old saying. compare apples to apples...oranges to oranges. etc. applies here. If you compare Skinner's Raisin Bran to other raisin brans. you are comparing apples to oranges. so to speak. Skinner's is made by an entirely different process than any other raisin brans. While I have had to use Post Raisin Bran and some of the organic products when I was unable to find Skinner's. the difference in taste is dramatic. The difference is in the way each is made. Skinner's is made by steaming the whole wheat kernels. rolling them flat and baking them. The common brands of raisin brans are made from wheat flour and other ingredients. and the flour is most commonly bleached and enriched. having been refined by separating the components of the wheat berry and bleaching the endosperm.the major ingredient in bleached wheat flour. Therefore. cereals made with bleached wheat flour lack the bran and most certainly the wheat germ. Those two nutritionally essential components of the wheat berry (the bran and the germ) not only provide the strong flavor. but also all the healthy ingredients provided by whole wheat. Furthermore. it is a well-known fact that only whole grains can be completely metabolized by the body; refined grains less so and tend to be stored rather than fully metabolized.<br /><br />Therefore. for those cereal eaters who are accustomed to raisin bran or other cereals made from wheat flour with flavor enhancers. the Skinner's at first taste may seem strong. mainly because whole wheat has a strong flavor. which could be interpreted as bad because it is so different from those made with refined flour. Also. because they are made from the whole wheat berry. the Skinner's flakes have a much firmer texture. the advantage of which is that they do not get soggy in milk before you eat the whole serving. My children and grandchildren all prefer Skinner's. either as a breakfast cereal or as muffins or cookies. I am so thankful to be able to get this product from Amazon since it is scarce in the markets in my region. Remember. apples to apples. oranges to oranges....
47031,B001E5E3B2,AWHNQULQ37XZI,Jane K. Smith,3/3,1195516800,I LOVE IT!,I've always loved Skinner's Raisin Bran...and since it is hard to find here on the West Coast. I order it from Amazon.  Comes right to my door. free shipping. 6 boxes at a time.  Doesn't get better than that.  I think I know why some people hate it...what they are tasting is good toasty bran flavor and plump natural raisins and what they are used to (Post. etc) is sugar.  Anyway. I love those crunchy little bran flakes and just enough raisins -- Skinner's Raisin Bran is perfect just the way it is.
47033,B001E5E3B2,A21VD6O0P1BI7L,Brian S. Luenser,3/3,1168300800,The best cereal ever!,I buy this cereal by the case because my local store does not carry it. It is the best Raisin Bran. in my raisin eating opinion.  Not too sweet... is what I like about it.  Just great flavor and consistency.

47058,B003Y7QKIW,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,Carlisle Wheeling,0/0,1320192000,Excellent Chocolate Bar!,Do you love dark chocolate without it being a bit too bitter?  Do you like almonds in said dark chocolate?  Well. I don't normally review this sort of product. but I was so impressed by this bar that I simply have to rave about it!  Not only is this great dark chocolate. but it melts easily in your mouth. making it water the moment it comes into contact with your taste buds.  It reminds me of the homemade fudge frosting my mother used to top our cakes with by using Baker's chocolate squares. heavy whipping cream. butter. vanilla. and powdered sugar.  That was so delicious we all wanted to lick the bowl and beaters.  This goes up a notch. adding almonds--the best nuts in the world--cocoa chips. and the distinctive accent of sea salt.  It is definitely your best friend when you want a great chocolate to consume with the wine of your choice in front of the TV. or just because you want to reward yourself sparingly for committing to a good workout.  Believe me. it's worth it.  Ghiradelli Intense Dark Seasalt Soiree' is the best chocolate bar I've eaten so far. and I'm a chocolate tramp!
47074,B001C4PKIK,A1VS3ZQ3VY13WA,Mr.Know,1/1,1289520000,Fromm Four-Star Surf & Turf vs Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon,My 2 Minature Schnauzers are 3yrs old and picky eaters. They were occassionaly spoiled by me adding chicken breast or turkey to their dry food. They eventually got bored of the Fromm Surf & Turf but for the first month loved to eat it. Yes. it's more expensive than the other dry foods but the ingredients used helped my prevent break-outs that one of my dogs were experiencing from allergies. I switched them to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness and it has higher protein and Omega fatty acids. The dogs enjoyed the change in food but it gave them both gas and one of them had diarrhea. I like the ingredients of the Blue Buffalo but according to my vet some owners are complaining about the same effects on their dogs because it's very rich. I'm remaining with the Fromm simply because of the quality and it's grain less so it helps my dog with allergies.

However. as with many products. as soon as it began to catch on and fly off the shelves. some brilliant purchasing agent decides to discontinue the product.  Such is the case with these two stores... leaving a host of taste buds craving the rich chocolate flavor.  I decided to try the internet. and to my pleasant surprise. I found the delicious morsel available at Amazon.  Pleased. as I so often am. with Amazon's range of available products. I pounced upon the opportunity and purchased a case of this deceptively low calorie dessert treat.  Now. we can enjoy the dessert with wild abandon. secure in the knowledge there IS a source.

Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors). they have now learned when it 10pm. which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway. quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?

It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing. trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves. they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them. not knowing they're being given medicine. Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now. it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also. with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

This bilberry tea has a mild. pleasant flavor...kind of like a mild blueberry flavor. Bilberry is known to be very good for the eyes. which is why I drink it...plus it is a good taste too. :)
47407,B0019GVBYI,A1XF26S1BECDGB,Ali,1/1,1342051200,Bilberry tea. disgusting!,Ordered this type of tea because I saw on Dr. Oz's website that this tea supposedly helps with cravings if you drink it in the afternoon. The taste is bad. horrible!  I had to add some honey to makeit taste a bit better.  Tried this for 4 days in a row and it didn't aid in cravings. cravings as in food cravings. This tea sucks. I also read on other websites that if consumed long term. may have side affects. Discontinuing this tea for sure.
47429,B001JYVTNS,A13NSUJ2BDIFAC,Mike P,2/2,1312070400,More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.,Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However. for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly. they do get expensive quick.

I can remember when a 4 from 10 or more people was close to a lock when it comes to product adequacy. This product's cumulative rating should have meant that Eight O'Clock French Roast would at least be drinkable. but it doesn't and it isn't - drinkable that is.  Really folks. those of you who think this is a GOOD French Roast have been drinking too much Taster's Choice Freeze-Dried (which I would accept a cup of before I would take one of this swill.)<br /><br />I never. NEVER throw food or other consumables out unless it tastes rotten. Half way into the first bag of this stuff I threw it and the other 3 bags in the garbage and sighed in relief. I had gotten rid of the worst rotgut bean coffee I had ever encountered. Really.

But this morning we tried the Carte Noire given us as a Christmas gift. What a delightful surprise. It has that blackness that we associate with good coffee but none of the bitterness. It is unquestionably the best coffee we have ever made at home. And with a small addition of Irish Creme syrup (another Christmas present). it was simply quite wonderful.

My westie is always chewing his feet and I've tried everything to ease his discomfort. It is especially bad when he chews on a treat because after he finishes. he can still smell the scent on his paws and continues to lick! It used to drive us crazy. until we tried these natural rawhide chews. My husband purchased these at a local drugstore when we got our new westie puppy and needed to give her something for teething. Needless to say our older male dog wanted to join in the fun! We gave him one and we were so relieved that when it was gone. he was done. no licking or chewing after the fact. I can't find them anywhere anymore except on Amazon. This is my second order of multiple packs. Whoops. I shouldn't have shared the secret. now all of you will buy them all up!

I couldn't taste any respberry. peach or Champagne.  It was simply a melange of the indistinguishable.<br /><br />  It was given a 3 because it did spread easily. the color is pretty and it moistened toast.

It was quite sweet. which didn't particularly encourage me because I was looking for a fruity flavor - maybe raspberry.  maybe peach?<br /><br />  A disappointment.

I recently read some online reviews on hot chocolate and this brand received rave reviews.  I've tried both the organic and the old world and both are fabulous.  The organic is a powder mix and the old world is chocolate shavings. I guess I'd say the old world is more intense and rich. but you can control the strength by how much you add to your hot milk. Both are definately worth the extra money and makes a nice holiday gift (with a couple festive mugs).  You can also find this brand at Whole Foods Market.
47777,B003SBTY2S,A9J95XWC49UIU,Shestands shestands,0/0,1317859200,I really like it!,To me this soda did taste like a mild root beer. very similar to A & W but without the intense syrup gag.  It's mild and creamy. similar to a cream soda but with that root beer flavor.  Unlike the other reviewer. I did not have any aftertaste from it.  I will definitely keep on buying this root beer!
47794,B001EPQOM8,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,C. F. Hill CFH,4/5,1279670400,Very Good REAL Wasabi - Highly Recommended,Sushi Sonic 100% Real Powdered Wasabi is just that. real Japanese Wasabi with no additives. The product description was a little confusing but the bottle states Ingredients: 100% Wasabi (Wasabia japonica) and no other ingredients.<br /><br />The 1.5oz (43g) jar contains roughly 17 servings when mixed with water as per the directions. The wasabi is a fine light green power that on its own is fairly mild tasting. It mixes it into a paste fairly easily and does not tend to clump. but don't be lulled into complacence by the complete lack of heat immediately after mixing as it will develop a respectable wasabi kick after sitting 10 minutes or so.<br /><br />I really enjoy the flavor and it is more subtle than the normal horseradish based wasabi found in tubes and most Sushi restaurants. I think it is worth the extra expense for special occasions. but for everyday use the normal wasabi will do for me.<br /><br />Note that this is a Product Of China. which might be a concern for some people.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
47809,B002L96UVG,A1I9GEA8NQ273V,Jayme,0/0,1327104000,Delicious!,These are great!  They taste very fresh and have the perfect bite of lime flavor with plenty of powdered sugar.  The packaging is very nice. which made these great gifts for our clients.  The boxes weren't packed very well for shipping to Amazon. so two of six had damaged corners. but the others were in good condition (original shipping boxes inside Amazon's shipping box).
47829,B002X4APX8,A1WFFR70IYCRJE,M. Bulla Amatullah,8/8,1313539200,really just an awful vanilla...,Honestly. I feel terrible writing this review because I searched and searched for an alcohol-free. liquid vanilla in a larger amount and really wanted to LOVE this product!  I bought this product specifically because I live abroad and needed a larger bottle and they offer this in 16 and 32 ounces.<br /><br />This product is very thick and tastes very strongly of chemicals.  I could barely get any vanilla flavor from it - and it makes my icings and frostings taste horrid.  The propylene glycol (not safe) just makes the product taste terrible.  It's listed as the second to last ingredient - but really - it just takes over any vanilla in the bottle.  And it comes out like glue into the measuring spoon and sticks!  Really a disappointment.
47858,B004SRH2B6,A32PE2127NFGBQ,AJ Villanueva,1/1,1222732800,Love it!,I first tried it here in our bikram studio.  They are pricey in that place.  But Sprouts sell it for much cheaper.  I love it.  It does rehydrate the body quickly after a sweaty session of yoga.
47864,B004SRH2B6,A2AKNT3D4QLC7L,Judy M. Stern,5/7,1277856000,Tastes like sweaty. vomit water!,Don't get me wrong. I REALLY wanted to love this as I had read so many great things about coconut water.  I was so excited when my order came.  I had some already in the fridge so it was cold.  After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water.  I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was.  I tried it again. I tried it over ice. I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck!
47877,B004SRH2B6,A3AUHV3Z3AZZD3,Melissa Ann Foligno,2/3,1287792000,Taste before you buy!,This is the most disgusting drink I have ever tried!  Don't buy unless you know what it is!
47918,B004SRH2B6,A3SIZC600PA0AW,miss-honesty Tiffany,0/0,1341532800,Only good if it's offered for a fair price!,Zico is a very mild green coconut water that lacks the sweetness of the Vita Coco brand. I mostly drink coconut water for the benefits so the specific taste range is broad for me. I don't like the floating prices on this site because when I purchased it. it was a good deal (especially coupled with free shipping). I've since seen the prices rise to almost double at times PLUS shipping sometimes which is severely unfair. I can find this at the supermarket so if it's not cheap enough here I'm not buying it. Bottom line!
47955,B004SRH2B6,A3F6B7BW36YUFG,Diana White,0/0,1334448000,The Best!,Love Zico coconut water!  I order 2 cases a month and have been extremely please with both the quality of this product and the service.  No complaints here!
47959,B004SRH2B6,A2RF0YBZ43IWEF,B. Hester,0/0,1332979200,1 Liter for about the calories of a can of coke,First. let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water.  I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand. which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious. though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim. it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label. other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins. whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too. I might add.

There's no shipping. it only takes a couple days to get there AND if you have some foresight. you can preorder a handful of cases at a lower rate and have them sent periodically. The only downside - having to stop yourself from downing a whole case of ZICO.

I wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting. Delivery was not what I expected either. It came in a box with many other items. it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds. I think the UPS guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out. I guess the good news is it came quickly. along with the disappointment.
47978,B004SRH2B6,AWH3T7QHREHVO,Kara,0/0,1327968000,So amazingly delicious,Wow.  This drink is awesome. So awesome that I picked up the phone and called the friend who recommended it to me immediately after my first sip of it to thank him.  Everyone else who I've introduced it to is equally hooked.  The best ways to describe the taste are 1) the leftover milk in a bowl of cocoa puffs cereal or 2) upgraded yoohoo.  Also worth noting is that several people who do not like the taste of plain coconut water are in love with this chocolate version.

48024,B004SRH2B6,A1TNL89FT6P4QW,Justin Miller,0/0,1317686400,Deliciously Addictive,I seriously love this drink.  When I was a kid. I remember when my father would buy a coconut; we'd open it and drink the water inside.  There was never very much but it was delicious.  We bought a coconut maybe once a year.  Now it's readily available all over New York City.  I have tried all of the flavors and in my opinion the Mango is by far my favorite.  It is a wonderful balance between staying true to a real coconut water flavor and taste with a compliment of Mango flavor.  I am a huge fan.  I feel a burst of energy every time I drink it and it tastes so great.  When I have it in stock at home. I drink more of it than tap water.
48027,B004SRH2B6,A3C5Z05IKSSFB9,M. Magpoc maliasuperstar,0/0,1317254400,Satisfies my sweet tooth!,I LOVE Coconut Water so when they came out with Chocolate Flavored Coconut Water. I was excited!<br />This tastes to me a lot like nonfat chocolate milk but you get the added benefits of Coconut Water.<br />I've been trying to lose a couple of extra pounds and whenever I get the urge for a late night snack or my sweet tooth sneaks up on me. I drink my Chocolate Coconut Water and it ALWAYS satisfies my craving for sweets!<br />What a lifesaver!

Osborn,0/0,1316304000,Great refreshment after exercise,I got a sample of this at a local running competition a couple years back and they've had me hooked ever since.  Totally refreshing after a run. definitely prefer the flavored to the plain (the plain takes a bit milky to me).
48037,B004SRH2B6,AD53Z7NOGYIMO,Alyssa M. Sanchez,0/0,1316044800,Surprisingly Good,While I love chocolate. I normally do not like chocolate flavored things. You know. things that aren't chocolate but are meant to taste like chocolate. such as chocolate Bonne Bell Lip Smackers. chocolate flavored Skittles. and cheap chocolate easter candy. I thought this would taste like super-watery chocolate milk and kept the first bottle I bought in the fridge for a month because I was too scared to try it. but I was completely wrong. It's delicious!!! If I had to describe the taste. it would be like melted dark chocolate gelato with a hint of coconut. I work at a small. outrageously overpriced local grocery store and we are selling it there for 2 dollars over the price of the per unit adjustment of a case here on Amazon (though I bought my bottle at one of those trendy chain health food stores for 1 dollar more over Amazon's price). So buy one bottle to see if you like it. and order the rest on Amazon. These prices can't be beat.
48050,B004SRH2B6,AEPLIU5PTB47W,Julie Ostoich JAOP,11/12,1189641600,Zico Coconut Water,Zico's taste is the best of all the pre-packaged young coconut water I've tried.  Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut. but this comes close to the flavor.  Don't waste your time on canned coconunt water - it's awful IMO.  Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I've sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving).  It is isotonic. high in potassium and rich in electrolytes.  You can practically live on it!  If you have an upset stomach. it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.  It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea.  A friend of my  9 yrs. old son's had a tummy ache while we were at the state fair.  I happened to have a Zico in my purse and gave it to him.  He loved it.  His stomach ache ceased and we were able to enjoy our time at the fair.
48051,B004SRH2B6,A1PW5K0ECIPQAC,Sarah C. Whittenberg,14/16,1306022400,Yummy -- but not what I was expecting,This is a delicious drink. but it is not the refreshing beverage you would expect. The chocolate formulation has added sugar and coconut cream. so it tastes like a dairy-free version of chocolate milk. (It is slightly reminiscent of a Mounds bar.) I was hoping that this would be more like a coconut-water-with-essence-of-cocoa. but alas this is not the case. Tasty. but not anything like the other Zico products. so be aware.
48055,B004SRH2B6,A3GGDMT5GB2BCT,K. Mcbain Bikram_Yoga_Chick,12/14,1276992000,Ick. Don't buy ths!!,Was so excited when I saw Zico had 14 oz containers of coconut water. This is not the original formulation. It is disgusting. It is like it has been boiled down into a concentrate and then water added. It tastes terrible & odd and has WAY too much packaging than the original style. Not thirst quenching at all.... makes me nauseous. Buy the brand One.<br /><br />Stay away from this product. Total waste of money.
48095,B004SRH2B6,A3VI6Z2AQX04DU,saltyeyes,0/0,1293148800,Good. but not the best flavor,I went online to find the Zico Passion Fruit coconut water and found that amazon had it for the cheapest price. afte trying the regular. passion fruit and mango I would have to say the regular is my favorite. mango second and the passion fruit last. the passion fruit just didnt taste very good to me and had a defining artificial taste.
48108,B004SRH2B6,A1KZJ2Q8PKRIU6,Cobra23,0/0,1281312000,What did they do???,This product was great in the TetraPak.  Now it is absolutely horrible.  The worst tasting coconut water compared One. Naked. and VitaCoco.  It tastes like plastic and nothing like coconut water.  This product in the plastic container is from concentrate.
48109,B004SRH2B6,A2JB7WRX86Y1YD,Naveen Ramaiah,0/0,1280534400,Its really nice... BUT!!!!,Man!!! I loved the previously available tetra pack ones. For some reason. I am not able to really appreciate the goodness of bottled ZICO which has ADDED FLAVOR now. The tetra packs were really refreshing and tasting real. Being from a south-asia country where freshly chopped coconut water are available. I was really impressed with the tetra packs that was available from ZICO previously. With the added flavor in these. I can feel the artificial flavor when I drink from the bottle now. ZICO has to go back and NOT add the flavor to make it REALLY natural and original. But overall I guess I could give a B+ rating on the product.
48116,B004SRH2B6,A2TPR6CK4KGRP6,B. Teixeira,0/0,1254787200,great taste . better when chilled,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.

48143,B004SRH2B6,A2TN93CGHJ046O,doctord,1/2,1308268800,horrible synthetic taste,I absolutely love the plain Zico Coconut water - I drink at least 1 or 2 of the large tetrapaks a week.  I have also enjoyed some of the other brands Mango flavored coconut water (O.N.E. and Vita).  So the logical progression was to try the Zico Mango.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. You can't taste the Coconut. but instead are overpowered with this terrible synthetic tasting Mango flavor that leaves a disgusting aftertaste that almost stings the back of my tongue. Like I said before. I am almost addicted to coconut water. and I hate to let things go to waste - but I couldn't even finish this bottle.<br /><br />After looking at the ingredients - Coconut water from concentrate and Natural Flavors.  I don't know what type of natural flavors they are using. or what constitutes a natural flavor.  Whatever it is. it's disgusting.<br /><br />I recommend trying one of the other brands coconut-mango mixes that actually adds small amount of Mango Puree.
48182,B004SRH2B6,A23H9F74EMOXEF,Ricardo Lopez,0/1,1264550400,Good Product !,I enjoyed the product. good taste. good quality. I purchased it on sale and without paying S&H. it will be overpriced if I have to pay everything. will purchase again next time is on sale :-)
48193,B004SRH2B6,A37WNO14U908ZX,Lion,1/3,1303257600,Great Hot Weather Drink,Coconut water is my favorite hot weather drink.  Refreshing and low calories.  But... it has to be cold. I think.  I like Zico's mild flavor.
48196,B004SRH2B6,A7UK8IV6EQ4CH,Baahston Bookie,1/3,1275177600,Tasty-licious!,all I can say is... I'm LOVIN' it!  so much easier and more convenient than the other packaging. and frankly. I think it's more tasty!  I used to be a passion fruit devote but now the natural is smooth and easy to drink.  I can't get enough!!!<br />Signing up for auto-ship.  It's too bad that you can't get more than one shipment a month --- I'm signing up for all three flavors!
48207,B004SRH2B6,A12B4XUKZCEJH7,T. Chan,11/21,1221264000,People consider this refreshing?,I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink. There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable.<br /><br />Amazon was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it.
48215,B004SRH2B6,A28HLJ4RW9IPOK,Lesley Richard,3/8,1275004800,ZICO,I love. I mean LOVE the new Zico bottle. The new bottle allows me to take it everywhere. The old packaging I had to use a straw cause I didn't really like having my mouth on it and had to finish it before I really did anything. but now that the bottles are out...possibilities are endless. Thank you Zico! My favorite flavor is the natural; it also tastes delicious with a little rum in it.
48225,B004SRH2B6,AE1ZRTZLNRY7L,Larry,1/6,1292889600,I love Zico!!!!,After trying Zico in a Walgreens in downtown Chicago. I've been hooked!  I love the taste of it. it is unbeatable and really quenches thirst. The other reviews I read say that it tastes plasticy. but I have never thought so.  I doesn't taste like plastic at all and it's much more convenient then the Terapack. I tried Vita Coco when I had a coconut water craving (because I couldn't find Zico) and almost puked! Vita Coco smelled like fermented lactose mixed with the scent of Original Chapstick and if someone handed it to me in a blank glass. I would have NEVER identified it as coconut water. I threw it out as soon as I got off the subway.<br /><br />Vita Coco is horrible! Zico Coconut water is AMAZING and is far better than Vito Coco!
48232,B004SRH2B6,AY12DBB0U420B,Gary Peterson,3/3,1334620800,Good Drink. But Too High In Sugar And Calories.,I noticed the Zico Coconut Water at my nearby grocery store and I tried a couple varieties of it. The drink was good. but nothing to write home about. However. they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next. I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh. this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium. which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So. it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
48235,B004SRH2B6,A3L8R6LUTRALE8,Suki,3/3,1311724800,Its Made From CONCENTRATE! Boo!,I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water. having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it. trying it at different temperatures - super chilled. room temp. mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN. I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious. it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico. I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had. this is the worst.
48246,B004SRH2B6,A1OMDWSAD35F1N,DialM punkyloserjess,5/6,1297728000,Saved Me!,I realize that people may think it's kind of expensive for coconut water. but it's at least twice the price where I live! If I had a coconut tree in my building than I wouldn't bother. but I don't! It is the best thing after a long workout or if you have forgotten to drink enough water during the day. It really saved me when I got really dehydrated. I recommend coconut water to everyone! And the light pineapple and citrus flavor is very nice. The original flavor is good too.
48255,B004SRH2B6,A378CW2YIPTCPF,WashThis,2/2,1313020800,My favorite coconut water,I've tried many cocunt waters (Vita Coco. O.N.E.. Goya. etc). and I find this to be the cleanest. most refreshing taste (especially when chilled).  Apparently ZICO uses different combinations of coconuts depending on the size of the packaging.  I can't speak for the other sizes. but the 33.8 oz is delicious!
48283,B004SRH2B6,A1VRQ81WJ1UF0H,MHoppy Margaret,1/1,1334448000,Yum-O,So good. so filling. and hydrating. I'm not a fan of plain coconut water. so this is a good substitute. I signed up for subscribe and save and just love it. It's a great addition to any household. dairy free. and all the benefits of coconut water. I can't wait to try it in a smoothie!
48295,B003Z8PR9I,AU1F92PDF7XTK,Inolvidable,1/1,1330128000,Delicious!,Exactly what I expected from Tim Horton's French vanilla Capuccino.  Thank you Amazon! Glad to know I don't have to travel all the way to Canada to get me some Timmis!!<br />This is a very taste and delicious drink. and very inexpensive. Love it!
48302,B003Z8PR9I,A12D19YNNPSWVX,Jules,0/1,1327104000,Good. but got bored after a while.,First time you taste this (especially with milk). you LOVE this.<br />But it's not something you want everyday. Rather. maybe once in a couple of weeks or so.<br />I use my espresso machine for everyday coffee. This is for that rare occasions<br />when I feel like something sweet. This can be also achieved by stopping by Starbucks<br />every week or so.
48316,B000KOWF0Y,ACWTZYV8JZXFO,A. Grimme,0/0,1323648000,Fit for Man or Beast,Both I and my dog find these very tasty.  Not-to-mention they are very healthful for both of us since herring is one of the better oily fish to eat.  An additional benefit is the added Sodium Hexametaphosphate....it helps prevent tartar build-up on teeth for both people and dogs.
48328,B000EVLS2E,A2LZS4UL9NAERU,badknee,2/2,1328918400,Great snack,I like this cereal as a substitute for popcorn.  I hate getting the little kernel things from popcorn stuck in my gums so this is a wonderful alternative.
48329,B000EVLS2E,A3H3UXROKIRVA4,Carol S. Hunter,2/2,1260921600,Great product,What a great tasty morning or anytime treat.  I don't have sugar in my cereals and this one is just perfect.  Filling. Fabulous and Fiber!!!
48341,B0000TNS50,A3MHYLTKLITXEV,P. Leblanc,0/1,1268697600,Great gift idea!!!,I purchased this for my fiance while he was away for military training over Valentine's day. He is a BIG chocolate and coffee lover and critic! He absolutely loved this basket! He shared it with his friend's on base and told me they all enjoyed it too. His favorite was mixing the chocolate stirs sticks and regular coffee. He compared the result to a delicious pricey coffee shop drink. I would highly recommend this! You get so much stuff for the price too!! It was such a hit I would even get it again for him in the future.
48351,B006H34CUS,A2BL5IVDAQZHJ1,Southern Angel,0/0,1344556800,Healthy and a snack I have to hide,I received the Quaker Banana Nut Bread Flavor from Influenster. I should have asked for several. Before I could say a word my kids had pilfered it and it was GONE!! Then they came back asking if I had anymore. If my kids eat it I will buy it. Plus it is a product I can trust to be safe and healthy for my kids. Definitely on my grocery list.
48400,B006H34CUS,AY4SNVEIIRNPG,paigem,0/0,1344038400,Delicious!,I received a trail size of this snack bar through Influenster (check them out. Influenster.com !) and it is SOO tasty. It absolutely reminds me of my mom's banana bread. only a little crunchier. I like the slight crunch of this product. it's a nice little surprise. I popped mine in the microwave for a few seconds. and I think there's no other way to go than eating this warm. Reminds me of the fall. and this seems like the perfect little snack and a cool. fall day! I'll definitely be on the hunt for these. I can't forget. they are rather healthy too! Fiber and protein and 20% daily value of 5 B Vitamins! YUMMY. DELICIOUS SNACK!
48409,B006H34CUS,A3KQILHOJF4HA5,Dani,0/0,1343952000,Yum!!!!!,I received this product (in banana nut) from Influenster in a vox box and I loved it!! It is especially good when warmed up in the microwave!! I highly recommend!!
48433,B006H34CUS,AC1BBWLL9DSPH,Shazaam Influenster,0/0,1343779200,Workday delight!,I received this in my Inluenster Summer Vox Box to try. I was running from meeting to meeting this morning. and had a very early breakfast with plans on a late lunch. I saw this in my bag and decided to try it. The Banana Nut Bread was delicious. I'm very conscious about limitng my carbs. so it was a concern but with the good amount of fiber. low sat. fat. and low sodium content I figured it was okay for a day. I wouldn't have one every day. but I would love to have an emergency stash at my desk for long mornings and late nights at the office. The flavor was right on point too!
48473,B006H34CUS,A2WOPZ6X3N8RKZ,prettyBRILLIANT,0/0,1343606400,pretty GOOD!,This is a delicious product. I had not heard or seen anything Quaker-based other than the oatmeal. which I have as a household staple. so I figured that since it's a Quaker product. it must be good!  Guess what?  I was right!  It was moist. chewy and not overly sweetened.  It had just the right amount of everything.  I had it as an afternoon snack along with a cup of coffee and it was awesome.  I'm looking forward to finding them at my local supermarket and having this as a treat every so often.
48486,B006H34CUS,A3UE2F3TIIBFXZ,Textbook Mommy,0/0,1343606400,Tasty Treat!,These Quaker Banana Bread bars are so tasty and I just love that they are low calorie. giving me a guilt free snack!
48487,B006H34CUS,AOELZJYT0M77Q,Yuri Kang,0/0,1343606400,Not bad for a quick snack or craving,This taste almost exactly like a banana muffin. The only thing I didn't like about it is that there is an after taste that I hated. The texture of this is great. Chewy but crunchy as well. Very moist! I would definitely purchase these again.
48516,B006H34CUS,AWJH4ZA0XW9XU,Sydney Holmberg,0/0,1343347200,love banana nut,This is pretty good for a bar. I love oats and oatmeal. so I knew I would like this. It's filling and kind of dense. but it doesn't taste like artificial flavors and sweeteners. I think it would be better warmed up. but I didn't think of that before I ate it.
48522,B006H34CUS,AXTQQ17LZ4OE1,Abbeybean,0/0,1343347200,Just OK,I thought this was just OK. not my favorite Quaker product and I don't know that I would actually buy it.  It does taste like banana bread a bit and it is soft. but it's also crunchy in some places.  Almost like it was overcooked.  I think I'll take nice warm homemade banana bread and if I need something quick I'll stick with quaker granola bars!
48537,B006H34CUS,A1T4ZLIRF3S117,Lawberryvery,0/0,1343260800,Quaker makes amazing snacks!,I was so happy to get to try out this bar free through the Influenster Voxbox I got! I am definitely one of those people that goes to any type of snack bar when feeling a little empty in the stomach. My favorite brand of bars to purchase have always been Quaker so I was pleased to get to try out something new!<br /><br />My number one type of bars to have are always ones that are along the lines of granola. oats. nuts and such. However. I was so excited to see something that's like a compacted baked good! The flavor I got was of course Banana Nut Bread and I have never tried actual Banana bread but I liked this bar! I love how it included almonds on the top because like I said. I enjoy that! This bar was very soft and chewy which is definitely something I look for but it also had some crunchiness which I also like - it was all just very balanced! I'm not a huge fan of bananas necessarily but I think this tasted great! You definitely get an after taste hint of banana but it all just works really well. This is definitely like having Grandma's goodies on the go!<br /><br />Overall. I think these would be amazing as a quick breakfast or snack any day! This bar was great (Quaker never fails to please) and I will definitely be trying out some other baked bars they have!
48540,B006H34CUS,AV5QQAA84CK0K,influenster1001,0/0,1343260800,pleasantly suprised,I received this in my influenster beauty vox box and didnt expect it to be very good. i was very pleasantly surprised. woul definitely buy for myself!
48546,B006H34CUS,A2IQVBKWV779WG,rz,0/0,1343260800,Tasty and Healthy,I found this snack to be tasty. healthy and satisfying! When I microwaved it. it was delicious.  Also very convenient for snacking on go.
48556,B006H34CUS,A2GC1YUW2C454H,R. Dixon,0/0,1343174400,Great Breakfast Treat!,I love this quaker oatmeal bar because you can heat it up or eat it right out of the package. It was so delicious that I even picked up a box at the store the next week at the grocery store and my husband has been taking them for breakfast every day and eating them on the way to work. thank you!
48569,B006H34CUS,A1FIYNWHF43VU2,briesgoodies,0/0,1343174400,OK. i guess,I didn't love this as much as i had wanted to. The box said that they use actual banana but it tasted very fake and overpowering to me...i don't know. maybe the bananas used to make the bar that I ate were a little over ripe. I liked the idea. and i bet some of their other flavors would be better.
48583,B006H34CUS,A3DK7YLAZW8FTI,Syntheticelegance,0/0,1343174400,Delicious!,I received a sample through my summer beauty voxbox I got from influenster. Well. let me say that it was so delicious that we went and bought two boxes and it and we've already ate all of them in less than a week!
48591,B006H34CUS,A3NU6SMAA7KVBT,bleuorchid21,0/0,1343174400,Delicious Snack,I recently received one of these bars in my VoxBox for review purposes and really quite enjoyed it. I am not a banana person at all but like almonds so figured I would test it out and am glad I did. I wouldn't have picked a box of these up in the grocery store but since having tried one. I have purchased three boxes. I prefer to microwave for 10 seconds since the bar tastes better heated up. It is also a bit crunchy and isn't overpowering in flavour. The size is perfect to carry around in a purse and you can keep some in your car or to travel with.<br /><br />The bar also contains traces of coconut and pecans but I don't like either and you can't even taste these ingredients.
48596,B006H34CUS,A1D59E6HERBSG,EMarie82,0/0,1343174400,Way better than my kid's granola bars!,I received these through Influenster and love them.  I have a two year old. so we always have a stock of chocolate chip granola bars. but even though they were convenient for a mom in grad school. I wanted something more mature.  These are wonderful.  I can throw them in my bag for a snack between class and picking up my daughter. I can also warm one in the microwave on the way to the gym. so it feel like I'm actually having breakfast.  I'm a fan of Quaker Oat products and this is one more in a long list of healthy treats I feel good about feeding my family!  Since receiving the one in my VoxBox. I've purchase 5 additional boxes.
48614,B006H34CUS,A1AILHZQ1GKBMH,ash101,0/0,1345593600,Good Snack!,I received one to try in my VoxBox from Influenster... Really good. except i don't like nuts so i ate around them. but you microwave it for like 10seconds and they're nice and chewy and warm. Yum! (:
48621,B006H34CUS,A1YPLD5L245954,mndymccllgh,0/0,1345507200,Yummy!,These are delicious and perfect for on-the-go! I'm not a big breakfast person. but definitely still need something on my stomach in the morning. These bars are just enough to get me started for the day and easy enough to carry out the door as I'm running off to work. They also work great as an afternoon snack when I'm wanting to reach for something junky.<br /><br />The consistency is a bit dry.. but that's pretty standard across all cereal bars. It's not legit banana bread. but it's good enough to get an A- from me!
48637,B006H34CUS,A1D75O7KEZJPP2,Shiva,0/0,1345161600,Delicious snack for when you're on the go....,This is a great snack item. It's delicious and even better when warmed. Perfect with that morning cup of coffee. It's just like a pastry.
48692,B005QKH1V0,AKQQYSZM8KLYJ,Lee B. Zoloto,1/1,1340150400,Very fragrant,Can't wait to open all three flavors and brew some really good coffee for iced coffee.  They smell just fantastic.
48697,B0001CXRLQ,A1S6PW1IZ6JDLW,juliette s.,2/2,1209945600,yerba mate for life,Everything about this tea it's sooooo true!!!! After just the 1st day. I feel well. energize. clarity of mind and I start having good night of sleep. If it wasn't so expensive. I could use it for the rest of my life...
48729,B001EQ4ADC,A1TMAVN4CEM8U8,Gunner,1/1,1316908800,I really enjoy these as a low carbohydrate snack or as a Hors d'oeuvre.,Old Wisconsin Beef Sausage<br /><br />I really enjoy these as a low carbohydrate snack or as a Hors d'oeuvre.  As an  Hors d'oeuvre you might want to cut each stick into 4 or 5 pieces.  I'll bet they would be good with a cheese dip.
48733,B001EQ4ADC,A3VNWON6OV0BQD,Daniel,2/3,1316995200,Spoiled,I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well. it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again!
48753,B001EQ4ADC,APC8R3ZSWMNRL,Hokie Mom,0/0,1295395200,These are Fantastic!,I am thrilled that I can get these through Amazon AND with prime shipping!  Much less expensive than paying $4+ in the grocery store per pack.  I personally like the turkey even better than the beef!  Great Low Carb Snack!
48773,B005Y1A8FW,A3NHZERVB4YV0O,bygwit,4/4,1291334400,Great product. but carries a bad odor,I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.  I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird. unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part. I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help. but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays. I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.<br /><br />Now that I've been using them for a while. I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad.
48787,B005Y1A8FW,A1143BSP9JCXXG,L. Koss A mom,1/1,1296086400,Good product,I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.
48813,B005Y1A8FW,A10M7SSDWPRF5M,Brittany Adam britta,0/0,1329782400,great product from a great company,great purchase and a great value from a wonderful company who stands behind their product.<br />Had four of the trays for about five months. and they were in CONSTANT use. We definitely got our money's worth!!<br /><br />After five months. we had a little issue with a funny smell (it did not smell like any of the food we froze) so I tossed the trays.  Scandinavian Child replaced them immediately.  they even tried to match the colors we had!<br />they REALLY stand behind their product. Their customer service was amazing; their genuine helpfulness and accountability for their product is so refreshing!!<br /><br />I look forward to having they trays again. and I would definitely recommend them.
48819,B005Y1A8FW,A8EQ1QXW2148I,Customer x,0/0,1309824000,love it,its more expensive than the rest but let me tell you....great quality. easy to clean. to use and works great cuz i have the meals ready to go....WELL PRESERVED
48824,B005Y1A8FW,AKE11AZTM3T6O,Emily Wong,0/0,1300665600,Excellent Tray for Freezing Homemade Food,This freezer tray is excellent - I am actually purchasing another - now that the little one is eating more food.<br />I'd like to prepare more at once. Frozen items scoop out easily with a spoon. Easy to clean!
48828,B005Y1A8FW,A2YCVGAH8NJGPZ,Matt Ondrejko 80's fan,0/0,1283126400,Baby Food Freezer tray,We have a friend that recommended this to us.  She makes her own baby food and freezes it in this tray for use later.  We will give it a whirl when our baby arrives.  It seems like a well made product.  It looks like it is good for BIG Jello-shots too!
48833,B005Y1A8FW,AXQFMPCPLAESY,Lili,2/4,1286496000,Not worth the money,I bought one of these thinking I would try it out and go back for more if it worked out.  They are cute. but I won't be buying more.  The Stay-Fresh Baby Food containers are MUCH better and cheaper.  The Stay-Fresh containers each hold 2 ounces and can go straight in the microwave.  Once the food is frozen I find it difficult sometimes to get the portion of food out of the Beaba container.  Not the best design and totally overpriced.
48872,B000EHP62G,AMQBHJWUQ3788,A. Huffman Health nut,1/2,1234396800,Yummy!,The bars are great!  They taste great and are healthy!  They're very filling.
48900,B000EHP62G,AWH9YY12Z10S5,G. Smith,0/1,1167782400,crunchy. chewy favorite,My daughter requested i purchase these for her. and it turns out i enjoy them also.
48921,B003VXE46Y,AP1O0056SOSNK,Cerilyn V. Wall,6/6,1319673600,Chia Seeds an Amazing Food,Chia Seed is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acid. I use it almost every day. I sprinkle these over my oatmeal. salads and yogurt for a nice texture. I also love the nutty taste. I can't find these in my local grocery stores so I'm very happy that Amazon sells so much healthy foods. I am very happy with Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds and will definitely continue buying this product.
48922,B003VXE46Y,A2ONYP5T36ML0T,Bobbi Key,4/4,1345593600,No rocks at all!,I read the most negative & positive reviews before ordering this product. I have found not one single tiny pebble (in two bags) as mentioned in the negative reviews. What I have found is tiny. very resistant to hydrate/soften CHIA SEEDS. That's it. nothing less and certainly nothing more. I've only used mine for smoothies for a creamier consistancy; no puddings or hot cereals. But. in my smoothies. they are wonderful! Chia seeds add a little more thickness. lots more fiber & other proteins. vitamins & minerals that add that little extra boost of good for you. The seeds when fully hydrated. remind me a little of tiny tapioca pearls (think bubble tea) with a slight crunch or bite. mouth feel to them. Unusual at first. but easy to get used to & actually quite nice once you're accustomed.

I have severe osteoporosis and my muscles have become painful with little activity. I added CHIA Seed to my diet and it made all the difference in the world. My back muscles relax quickly and I feel no pain in my back. A tablespoon of CHIA seed in a cup of water 3 to 4 times a day gets me through my day. I have been using CHIA seed for 6 months now and I am looking forward to many more happy days.
48936,B003VXE46Y,A2H7XYU3LZWITO,salmonberry,3/4,1331596800,Good alternative to eggs,These are a good alternative to chicken eggs. I soak 2 tbs. in 1/2 to 3/4 c. water for about 15 min. or till they're really gelatinous like an egg. then add them to baked goods recipes. They help moisten and bind gluten free baked goodies. 4 stars is because they're a bit bitter tasting (not too noticeable if mixed with molasses or honey though).
48942,B003VXE46Y,A3SIZC600PA0AW,miss-honesty Tiffany,0/0,1348444800,got chia?,I'm a 27 year old girl who has been looking into alternative ways to live cleaner. I've incorporated cleaning with vinegar and cooking with coconut oil. Chia seeds were something I stumbled on to by accident and haven't looked back since! The easiest way I get some into my diet is by putting a scoop into a regular water bottle. letting it sit for ten minutes. a quick shake and you're good to go! I've incorporated Nature's Guru instant coconut water packets into my routine and the result is I can chug the whole thing and enjoy it. The benefits I've noticed is extreme regularity. You won't be irregular after two days of adding chia. It's a good thing for you to be ridding your intestines of all wastes. My lower stomach is flatter by virtue of everything fast tracking through. Chia seeds have many benefits which I won't get into here. They are like sesame seeds in shape and poppy seeds in color and texture. They will form a gel around them after being exposed to water and this is what will clean you out. I caution you from sprinkling them onto dry foods because they need moisture and will seek it from your insides if you're not sufficiently hydrated. Bear in mind to be sufficiently hydrated you should take your body weight and cut it in half and drink that in ounces. for example: 160 lbs is 80 ounces. For novice chia users try mixing it into juice or your favorite flavored drink. Shaking will distribute the gelled seeds the best. Stirring might produce uneven clumps that may turn you off. I hope this convinces someone to try chia. Taking care of your body is definitely the way to go.

48959,B001E5E0T2,A25CUWEGSAC66U,Deegan Peter Deegan,7/10,1273536000,Clearly the best choice,My local grocer doesn't carry the Melitta brand unbleached coffee filters.  When I have asked him if he could. he says the demand isn't great enough to give them shelf space.  Yes. the Melitta unbleached coffee filters do cost a little more. but then if the end result is a much better cup of coffee why wouldn't someone pay the extra 1/2 cent or less for a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have used the unbleached coffee filters from Albertsons Or Krogers and they do not make as good a cup of coffee.  The competition's filters are thinner allowing the water to run through more quickly resulting in a weaker cup of coffee.  I think Melitta has this figured out and has gone the extra mile to produce the best cup of coffee available.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it.  Using the cone system and the unbleached coffee filters allows an individual to make the best cup of coffee allowable with the coffee beans of your choice.  I am not going to waste  my time explaining why the other systems for producing a cup of coffee are less desirable.  I bought two orders containing a total of 1200 coffee filters to get the free shipping.  Since I only drink one or two cups a day. that should last me almost three years.  The big saving for me is that I will not have to chase all over town trying to find filters every time I run out.  If the locals don't want to carry the Melitta brand. they are going to lose out to anyone and everyone who is internet savy and knows that Amazon carrys the Melitta brand.  This is just another example of our changing times and should be a lesson to the local merchants.  Get your act together or your going to be out of business.  Every sale you lose to the internet is dollars taken out of the community that will never be spent in your store.

48973,B001E5E0T2,AXSV2IRQX2C20,JAScribbles Kindle is charged and ready!,0/3,1332806400,Good for One Use,I like to brew myself a single cup of coffee every once in a while. I have the Melitta filters and a plastic cone holder. I place both on top of a coffee cup and pour in the hot water. This method works well once. If you plan to have a second cup of coffee. add a touch more coffee grounds. and run through another round of water. it will not work well. The flow is blocked and slow. Even if you move around the grounds with a spoon. the drip is too slow to warrant a second use.<br /><br />So these are good once. If you want to save on waste and cut down on your garbage creation. pick another method.<br /><br />I visited their website and couldn't find any information on their annual donations to forest conservation. I did eventually find them listed as a corporate partner (AKA donor) on the American Forests . org website. It's nice to see companies giving back to the environment.

49088,B000QVE9EG,A2713JZ4JBV42E,Dan Crookston DTC,0/0,1298592000,SO DELICIOUS,These are delicious. end of story.  The worst thing I can say is that they're too good - I have a hard time eating them at a rational or reasonable pace.  I've had a lot of dried mango brands. and this one takes the cake every time.<br /><br />There's not much else to say - these are mango slices in a bag.  They really pack 'em in there. you're getting your money's worth on volume.  They are dried but this doesn't mean tough or leathery by any means; they're always soft and tender.  Occasionally you'll get one that's got a bit of that fibrous stuff in it that all mangoes have. but it's rare - maybe one or two per bag. if that.<br /><br />These mango slices DO have a light dusting of added sugar. so if you're looking for something without added sugar. these may not be for you.  But honestly if sugar is a big concern for you. probably dried fruit isn't what you want anyway.

My favorites are the purple and the white/clear ones. but all of them are really good. Anyone with whom I've shared these wine gums immediately love them. too.

They are just baked cheese- nothing else. The flavor is intensely cheesy. and a bit on the salty side- but something I'll buy again.  Outstanding for those with carbohydrate restrictions (hey. diabetics- I'm one of you. and finding these to be just right for that salty snack urge). I also like the portion control.  :)  BUY THEM !!!

The package is quite small and there is not a lot of product inside but it is just the right amount to satisfy a craving for a real cheese snack.

I use it in my tea. in baking. in cooking. and for every single sweetening need I have. No maltitol fillers that add carbs (as powdered or granulated sweeteners need to do). and just one drop gives the sweetness of 2 tsp of sugar. GREAT stuff. never am without it!
49460,B003LECIDE,ABD6AG3VGOUUJ,William R. Berry To work in the service of l...,0/0,1346544000,Simple and Convenient,A one thousand (sometimes 1200) packets of Splenda is $20.88 at Sam's Club as of this review.  I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic four months ago and opted to treat cause not symptom and no longer require oral or injection insulin and my diabetes status was upgraded to managed with diet (Low Carb - Paleo).  You really can substitute neutral-tasting vegetables for tortillas. rice. grits. oat meal (not oat fiber). flour and pasta!  It is cheaper to make your own Liquid Splenda but it will take a bit of work figuring out the strength of the solution relative to a 0.5 oz bottle of Ez-Sweetz which in my research short of making it yourself is the strongest solution out there at a factor of 300 times sweeter than sugar where most other products come in at the standard 192 times sugar.  As many reviewers have stated. it is important to read the label of EZ-Sweetz other sizes; they are not the same strength though often they are cheaper.  I plan to make my own but not before I have enough of the bottles which for the moment are incredibly simple and convenient and I can confirm what other reviewers have said about one for work. the coffee maker. the book bag. the car and a couple bottles for backup should you lose one.

I have used Sweetzfree for years but I was ready to try something else just because shipping used to take so long.<br />The price for this is compatible. the taste and concentration is similar and I think I prefer this smaller dropper to the 1 oz Sweetzfree dropper.  Extra portable and I think the drop size is easier to control with the small Ez-Sweet. so I never get too much sweetness by accident.  Like it!

The bottles are a good size to throw in your purse or pocket. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's quite as sweet as another sweetener I tried (sorry. I can't remember what it was). I actually have to put two drops in my coffee to make it taste like two teaspoons of sugar - but this is normal. I think. It's just that the other one I used only took one drop.  I'd buy this again. though.

I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The Organic Premium is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs. with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder. on the other hand. is much lighter and more delicate. Same price. same distributer. both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

It's light. vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas. and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint. jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself. plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer. I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder. and recommend this tea instead.

49622,B0000TWLJO,A1T1LLS0I1FFPR,Pearls' Wisdom,1/1,1215302400,Perfect cup of tea,I first had this company's tea in Seattle.  It is a little shop at the famous open air market. Pike's Place.  I highly reccommend the Red Bush and Orange Spice tea.  It is wonderful beyond description.  The flavor is so distinct. one would know they are having tea from this store.
49650,B0018CID1M,A17YPMCHJ10PEZ,Kerrie_T,0/0,1340496000,My dogs love it,I am fanatical about what I feed my two labrador retrievers.  So many friends have dogs with cancer and other crazy diseases.  My belief is that it is due to the crappy junk they feed their animals.  My dogs are both 9 years old and have no significant health issues.  They have bright eyes. shiny coats. and firm stools.<br /><br />I rotate flavors every couple of months and no matter the flavor. they happily eat up all of their food.  (Then again. they occasionally eat wild animal poop so I guess they aren't too discerning).<br /><br />My personal experience with this food has always been very positive and I've got two healthy dogs to prove it.

We discovered Think Thin Bars and can't get enough of them!! Not only are they Gluten Free. bu they are high in protien and sugar free. These bars are a very good in-between meal and after workout snack!!
49683,B000CRHQN0,A1HGKQMDQQECOO,Darrell,1/2,1316736000,Taste good,They taste good. they are healthy and low in carbs.This isn't a reflection on ThinkThin.Otherwise. I am really into these and even take them with me on vacation.
49691,B000CRHQN0,A2P8SPA4XZVY73,Kalani,0/1,1317513600,Adore Think Thin Protein Bars,Think Thin Brownie Crunch protein bars are my all time favorite. I have one for breakfast every day. Fabulous with coffee! Delicious. Sugar Free. Gluten free. to boot!
49695,B000CRHQN0,A1Z3F716OX8GLM,Brie,0/1,1303862400,Great balanced bar,These are an ideal bar for on the go! Though I would not order them again during the hot season here in Southern California. They arrived melted.. This was NOT Amazon's fault. Load up when the delivery trucks aren't so hot and you will be set! They last me 2 hours (before I need more food) and I highly recommend them! Chunky Peanut is the BEST!
49707,B000CRHQN0,A1WODYFQ8NZ3U8,Berg,0/2,1246233600,These are great!,I really like the think thin protein bars. They taste great and have a good amount of protien in them.

The ThinkThin Chunky Peanut Butter bars have the best taste. excellent texture and fill me up when I need it.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.  I buy them by the box and if I could find a place where I could buy them by the case with a bigger discount. I would.<br /><br />-Julian
49714,B000CRHQN0,A292RIQH3B7Q77,Jasmine,36/42,1280188800,Love thinkThin Bars but these were so stale!,I love thinkThin bars (especially the chunky peanut butter) and buy them all the time at Trader Joe's.  When Amazon had a Deal of the Day for them at a discounted price. I immediately ordered two boxes (and signed up for a subscription because their price seemed a little better than Trader Joe's.)  Unfortunately. the two boxes of Thinkthin bars I received were so stale they were inedible - the bar was covered with a white powder and fell apart into dusty crumbs when I broke off a piece to check the inside condition.  Like an idiot. I actually decided to taste the bar just to make sure the appearance was not deceiving - I really do love these bars and my mouth was watering for one!  YUCK - the taste was horrible and I couldn't seem to wash it away!  Amazon doesn't allow food returns. so I've contacted customer service and asked for my money back.  I want a full refund - and I've cancelled my subscription.  So. buyer beware - thinkThin bars are great. but you apparently have to be careful where you buy them.  And sometimes a seemingly great deal of the day is not that great.
49725,B000CRHQN0,A156UWX9C94RX9,Carrie Gillespie,2/2,1311120000,Horrible Protein Bars (ThinkThin Protein Bar),Horrible!  When my friend gave me these Chunky Peanut Butter bars to try that she purchased at Whole Foods in California. I thought they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - delicious.  The two boxes I received from Amazon.com were horrible.  Each bar was encrusted in white - looked like mold.  It didn't taste like mold but it was tasteless and gross looking.  Some other reviewers complained about the same thing but I hoped the bars would be more like my initial experience - high protein and delicious.  It is going to be a long time before I enjoy a chocolate covered anything - maybe that is the best thing to come out of having to throw out almost $30 worth of bars.
49730,B000CRHQN0,A1CJ1G8DXTTNYV,Mark Riccardi riccardim,4/5,1281916800,Really. Really. Bad,These are really. really. bad.  I got them as a lightening deal and wouldn't encourage anyone to buy these.  As a previous reviewer stated. they have a terrible chemical taste to them.  I'm really disappointed in these.  Save your money and buy EAS. Balance. or any other power bar but this brand.  I mean. they are just awful.
49734,B000CRHQN0,A3SC2WN4Y8KF3J,Jill,1/1,1343779200,Questionable quality,I usually buy these from Trader JOes but thought it would be easy to buy a box of them.  The two bars I have opened looked like the chocolate was crumbling off and smearing all over the inside of the package.  They also taste a bit odd.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing.
49749,B000CRHQN0,A1FVVUN9QRKK2X,Jen,4/6,1174953600,Best tasting protein bar I've had so far,I've tried several brands of protein bars and this one is great.  I especially like the fact that it contains more protein than the Luna/Cliff bars. uses protein Isolate instead of Concentrate. and has no added sugar (who needs more calories?!).  I prefer bars that have only Whey protein Isolate or Soy Isolate since I'm lactose intolerant (whey concentrate doesn't agree with most people who are lactose intolerant).  I really like the taste and texture of the bar and it doesn't have a foul smell like some others I have tried.  I would like to see them make a mostly organic version like Cliff/Luna has done and possibly lower the fat content a little.  This bar really helps stave off hunger for several hours thanks to the high protein content.
49759,B000CRHQN0,A4FJHPDSQQ9XK,asdlkjaspodifuwe,0/0,1347494400,Mediocre,These bars are huge. with good texture and very filling. The taste is mediocre (a bit fake). Overall. they'd be fine if it weren't for all the sugar alcohols.... all ELEVEN grams of them. That much maltitol tends to mess with digestion. I'd go with a different bar. if it's going to be a regular in your diet.
49764,B000CRHQN0,A1MT9MXM2YDI0D,lindasp1544,0/0,1339977600,taste great,I bought this product as it was sugar free. not like all the other bars out there. It taste great and I keep one in my purse at all times. I will be buying more.
49769,B000CRHQN0,A22K50YHYICJGP,m,0/0,1331596800,Taste is Sub-par,I decided to give these a try after being practically addicted to the peanut butter clif builder bars - I wanted to see if I like something else more ... and it turns out I was extremely disappointed with the taste of these bars.  Actually. not only was the taste sub-par. but I did NOT like the consistency either when compared to the more firm clif builder bars.  Won't be buying these again.
49790,B000CRHQN0,A38X687G05D112,dryad,0/0,1301443200,Meh.  Not overly excited by this product,When I first saw the reviews for this product. I got very excited and purchased two boxes.  When I got them. I was disappointed to realize that at least part of the protein was from soy -- in general I tend to stay away from unfermented soy products -- and I found the taste rather meh.  They weren't awful but overall. I don't think I'll buy them again.
49823,B000EUIZ8K,A3SJUCPMB971EJ,C. Pizzolato,0/0,1253059200,One of my favorite green teas,As a tea lover. I must say that this is one of my favorite teas of all time. Tazo does a wonderful job balancing out the hints of mint and lemon within this green tea blend. This tea is perfect as is. No sweetener needed!
49849,B005PURN7S,A3Q2EYEVFM4UBW,alicia homeshopper01,0/0,1328572800,WONDERFUL TASTE & AROMA,I'm a big drinker of organic coffee ... it contains more of the antioxidants and less toxins than processed coffee. and this is one of the best.  This is a medium-strong blend with a mild vanilla favor that's not overpowering.  I add stevia (natural sweetener) and sprinkle a little organic cinnamon and have a super-healthy dessert type drink.  Great price. too.
49858,B004X8W2GK,A2I9MVUZOD7G2A,Tracy H,2/2,1311897600,Not full weight,Received this today I guess when they say net weight they mean bag too? Only received 48 pounds of spelt not 50lbs. I triple checked the packages that I made with a very accurate. highly sensitive scale. had my spouse check the weights. and yep only 48 pounds of product.
49870,B000TIOQBM,ATSAWVR11NPPS,Amber Fox Amber,4/4,1237680000,Big Daddy is Right!,My sister found out about smoked paprika thanks to Big Daddy's House on the Food Network.  I use it constantly and find it as great a staple as garlic in cooking.  Smoked paprika indeed adds a beautiful smoked flavor to foods without the barbeque grill.<br /><br />Purchasing the small jars from the supermarket was getting too costly.  By purchasing the 1 lb. size. I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price. but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika. please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do. please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed.
49890,B00113SKZC,A5UJFO0JDLB4J,alobreto,3/3,1297728000,Not Your Average Bouillon Cubes!,If you buy these bouillon cubes thinking they will be like the salt-filled cubes you buy at any grocery store. think again. The texture is different. Solubility is different. Taste is different.<br /><br />First let's discuss texture. The texture of these cubes is a lot like firm butter that was just taken out of the fridge. You can cut it like butter. so dividing is not a problem the way it is with salty. powdery cubes. It does tend to stick to the foil wrapper. but comes off easily using a knife. fork. or even spoon.<br /><br />We will go on to solubility. When you put these into hot water or put them in cold water then heat in the microwave. they do not break down as quickly as you might be accustomed to. The pieces that come apart in the water need to be stirred momentarily and pressed against the side of the container with a spoon. This does not take more than a minute.<br /><br />The taste is different. too. It has an inviting aroma and tastes like actual vegetable broth.  There is no overpowering salty taste. and these can be used to make a stronger tasting liquid than high-sodium cubes.<br /><br />This bouillon makes a great gravy when you use the whole cube in 1-1/2 cups boiling water. Stir 3 tbsp of corn starch into 1/4 cup cold water. Stir cold cornstarch water into boiling liquid till thickened. Add a little pepper and serve.<br /><br />I've also used it to flavor soy based textured vegetable protein (TVP) for use in meatless meatloaf and other dishes.  I just use it in place of the boiling water.  I like to use a bit stronger broth for that purpose.<br /><br />I give this product very high marks. Buy with confidence. Whether you are vegetarian or not. whether you are salt-restricted or not. this bouillon does not disappoint.
49891,B00113SKZC,A327UU4BJPFVA3,MDt MDt,3/3,1278374400,Great broth,I use these things for everything from soups to rice to broth substitutes. The flavor is soft (not sharp or bitter or pungently salty) and you really taste the seasoning flavors rather than a nice glob of MSG nastiness. Highly recommended... and. yes. I purchase a whole case of these bad boys. I have given some packages away as gifts to friends and they equally enjoyed them. I won't use salty canned broth ever again.
49906,B00430B73W,A27CJI118OSX0X,Jason Daniels Jason,2/7,1166745600,DISGUSTING!!,Wow!  I did not know that someone could make a business selling food that tastes so bad!  No wonder these are called Raw Revolution... they taste revolting!!<br /><br />It seriously blows my mind that someone could make a food with chocolate and coconut that tastes so awful.  The first taste is poor. at best.  The mouth feel is grainy.  And the aftertaste... wow thats nasty.<br /><br />I ordered these b\c they were on sale and I wanted to try organic raw food.  Good thing that was a cheap lesson.  Learn from my mistake.  DONT BUY THIS!
49911,B00430B73W,A1IM4D3R61A2K0,DR. B,1/11,1222560000,Another organic bar. but its HALF fat.,This bar has 265 calories and 135 from fat.  I know. I know. its organic!!  Sorry just because its organic and natural doesn't mean that it can be 50% fat and be good for you.  If you like the taste fine. but be honest you're eating it for the taste. about the same calories and fat content as a Dove candy bar.
49929,B00430B73W,A35WNH41QM5DRC,Elizabeth Mcnutt,3/3,1248220800,Surprisingly Great,I first tried these when the organic co-op I belong to had them displayed for sale during pick-ups. I love the flavor. I've only tried 2 or 3 but this is my favorite. I keep them in the car and at work as a healthy alternative when I'm hungry but can't get to a meal. One day I was driving home from work and was starving and had half a bar and was totally satisfied! Also these don't dry out. I often eat half a bar then eat the other half later and somehow they stay super moist. Maybe it's oil or something bad. I'm not sure. but it works great for me. Reading some of the 1 star reviews it seems some people just don't like the flavor. I was lucky and got to try out 3 bars before deciding on a favorite flavor. I wouldn't suggesting buying a 12-pack for a sampling. however I haven't found these sold in stores (just started looking) so not sure where you would taste... I think this is a good price too. or at least it's cheaper than my co-op sells them for! And love the subscribe and save option too...
49938,B00430B73W,A35YE556PM70SJ,Bill,2/2,1236902400,Good addition to my healthy diet.,The Raw Revolution Hazelnut and Chocolate Bars really taste good -- especially considering this is raw health food.  Buying via the subscription method on Amazon.com makes for a convenient. low priced way of obtaining them.  I recommend this flavor.
49939,B00430B73W,A1YJ8LZ6RD6GNL,Mr. Scott Grover advice guru,2/2,1225065600,If you like energy. chocolate. fiber. protein. and great taste...!,What could you possibly want more than a healthy product such as this?<br /><br />The one suggestion I would make (from past experience):  refrigerate. especially as they get closer to sell by or use by dates.<br /><br />Otherwise. just enjoy (at a great price) a great healthy boost any time of day! I have yet to find a product from Raw Revolution that was not more than worth the money.
49957,B00430B73W,A1QJYAJNKNURB,Des,1/1,1280016000,Raw bars,This bar is delicious!!!  It tastes like a brownie!  I can't find them in my local area and was very happy to find them on Amazon!  YUMMY!
49966,B00430B73W,A33AGV9WXQQT0J,Samantha Morgan,1/1,1244592000,Good,I like these. but I like the chocolate better(my favorite).  I purchase them all the time at whole foods. I like getting a full box. but would love a variety pack.
49982,B00430B73W,A2MXJTEA7MU1DL,Ransomed Heart,0/0,1315353600,These bars are amazing!!,I bought these for the 1st time when I was going on a temporary raw fast but fell in love with them.  They are my 'on the go' breakfast choice now and its so great knowing they are healthy!
49984,B00430B73W,AOP5TUC7TTEY0,J,0/0,1310774400,great bar,One of the best tasting bars I've found.  Tastes like a fresh brownie with no bar aftertaste.  Only problem is very high calorie count. but I guess you can't have everything.  They are very filling.
49985,B00430B73W,A38NPDPN3GDVXG,Kissy29,0/0,1301702400,Love this stuff,This is a great snack when you are on the go and want something tasty. Its hard to find coconut flavors. which is my favorite.

Enough chemicals in it for a nuclear explosion.<br /><br />It's also fish tank gravel texture.<br /><br />I would not recommend this candy to my worst enemy.
50025,B000ER5DFQ,A7INGAHQIWQ1,Samylee00,1/1,1306972800,No Issues,I don't know how everyone else got these broken. but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap. not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all.
50041,B000ER5DFQ,AKSSGVF9DMJDU,Gretchen Rowley Gretchen Rowley,0/0,1299542400,Had to toss 9 out of 12 jars,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.

50121,B000EZ7J9G,A1VXZJVVLQNX9G,originalwit,0/0,1349136000,Basil Lover's Dream,I adore Basil. let's just get that out there.  But I'm pretty frugal. let's get that out there too. so I've generally bought fairly low-end Basil. nothing all that fancy.  But given how much Basil I use. the Tone's (at $7.20 or $1.30/oz) worked out to be a good deal. so I thought I'd take a chance.  Oh. I'm glad I did!  This is good. sweet Basil. with none of the bitterness that sometimes affects dried herbs like Basil and Oregano. for example.  I'm prone to use a pretty heavy hand with Basil. sometimes removing the shaker top and just dumping. so I'm delighted I won't be running out any time soon. I couldn't find any expiration date on the bottle but it certainly seems fresh.<br /><br />My favorite recipe using Basil is my own version of one in <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679767959>Heartburn</a>.  If you google Linguine Alla Cecca Nora Ephron you should be able to find the recipe from her novel.  For my own quick & easy version. I combine drained canned diced tomatoes (I like Furmano's) with olive oil. a halved peeled garlic clove. and plenty of dried Basil in a bowl. If you like it spicier. you can add red pepper flakes.  Cook linguine. drain.  Remove the garlic cloves from the tomato mix and discard - you're just going for subtle flavoring. not full-on garlic breath.  Pour tomatoes over pasta and mix.  Heaven!  For variations. I add things like chopped clams. chopped black olives. or capers. depending on what I've got on-hand.
50126,B004UBC50S,AZC5EBJFOKPXQ,Sharon,0/0,1314662400,Good. and with a little nutritional value too,The taste and texture of this bread is really pretty good. and yes a little better than Udi's Sandwich White. which is not bad itself.  A big selling point for me is that this bread at least has a couple of grams of protein and fiber. as opposed to any other gluten-free breads I've seen. which are all just basically empty carb calories...like eating junk food.
50132,B0017SWAAW,ADNEQ31H3LWGA,Debbie L,11/11,1247356800,Takes a little getting used to,Since soy and anything made with casein is not an option for us. I was happy to find this mix.  This does not taste or smell like cheese (otherwise I would give it 5 stars). and we didn't like it when we first tried it.  However. since it is still pretty tasty in its own right. I tried it a few more times. with a few weeks between each time and eventually I found the right thickness for us (I also added a little more salt).  This is the case for pretty much all other replacement food items we've tried. because we are on a very restrictive diet which leaves us very few options in the ready-made/semi ready-made category.  By now (5 months later) my 5 year old probably can't remember how the real cheese tastes like. so as long as the food is tasty. he is happy.  As for me. I am happy to find one more item that can save me some time in food preparation.
50133,B0017SWAAW,A2YCEKVUN1W5F1,"K. Salinger MBA, MSN, FNP, RN",10/10,1258329600,Great alternative for gluten dairy & casein free,This is a great product for those who need gluten. dairy & casein free foods. We use both these individual packets and the boxes with the GF noodles - both are handy and great.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think you can get fake cheese or non-cheese to taste like the real thing?!? If you're looking for something to replicate real cheese or annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However. if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix and the other roads end products. It has a unique flavorful taste. We tend to alternate this stuff <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W>Namaste Foods. Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish. 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese than the Namaste but again. those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However. for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots. peas. corn. etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBSO>A. Vogel Trocomare. 3.2 Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten. dairy. casein free) - buy this. it's great!!!
50134,B0017SWAAW,A1YTA3TBWBPCPG,blondie,4/4,1303171200,So - so,I liked the taste and it was not hard to make but the Chreese had a terrible consistency.  It was thick and gloppy - not at all like a smooth sauce.  I made it three times with the same result.  It's possible I'm doing something wrong. but I believe I am following the directions to a T.<br />That being said. it does taste really good and definitely satisfies a cheese craving.  I will continue to use it. but probably won't serve it to guests until I can figure out the consistency issues.

I buy these cookies by the carton.<br />They last for one month between my husband and I.  He likes cookies<br />with his morning coffee.  We are both satisfied with these cookies.<br />Would buy them again and again.<br /><br />Mary

The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely. slightly more crumbly and grainy texture. It has been a wonderful discovery. Bon appetit.

50309,B008FE437E,A1NWD7EIDJC4BW,Rocky6670 Rocky,0/0,1351036800,Perfect for Dry Mouth,I recently started a new medication and unfortunately one of the side effects was dry mouth. My doctor recommended I try sugar free lemon drops to help alleviate the discomfort of dry mouth. After doing some research I decided to give Brach's Sugar Free Lemon Drops a try. I was a bit hesitant ordering a whole box of these lemon drops without knowing how they would taste. what the after-taste would be like and even if it would work. After having used them for couple of weeks. I wholeheartedly recommend this product. I keep a bag in mine and my wife's car. one at work. in my night stand drawer and in a candy dish in the kitchen. My wife usually hates the taste of most sugar-free products because of the after-taste. but I was surprised when she said she really liked these! Give these a try if you too suffer from dry mouth and see if they work as well for you as they have for me.
50310,B001DWEF8W,A3QC097VQ0GQ1S,Carolyn D.,5/5,1229990400,totally fooled my friends with this awesome cake,This cake tasted as good as a home-made (or better!) cake but took 1/2 the time.<br />Seriously. And I'm a total baking (as well as natural foods) snot!<br />Not convinced of my credentials?<br />You should see the rye. sourdough and challah breads out of my oven today.<br />Not to mention the batches of cookies.<br />The amount of flour and butter I go through on a weekly basis for cookies. cakes and breads would let you know: i'm the one person in 100 whom you'd classify as a good home baker. I'm definitely not a mix baker. And while baking my own birthday cake just seemed un-festive.  asking someone else to bake my cake seemed like it'd spell disaster.  But Someone else offered. And that Someone Else. not as comfortable with my cake pans as I. used Naturally Nora. And both of these baker elves agree: it was delicious and easy to make. And from my guests' opinions.<br />no one could tell the difference between this mix and home-made. Soooooo tasty. And the icing mixed up as a breeze.<br />Next year. when I'm considering mixing up my own birthday cake or using a Naturally Nora Mix. the decision is easy. Nora. All the way.<br />!<br />You won't believe how easy and tasty it is.<br />I'd show you a picture. but there's none left.

I like to use it as a base and add more oats. nuts and cranberries but it is great by itself too.Not too sweet. no overpowering spices like too much cinnamon and plenty of fiber. Great with fresh berries. I wish Amazon still carried more varieties of this product as it is so hard to find without paying huge shipping costs.

What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish. and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk. along with cardamom. to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted. orange blossom water is and acquired taste. and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions. mixed with fruits. nuts. coffees. teas. and pastries.  A superb product!

The new flavor does not use oil of spearmint. having substituted artificial flavors instead. Bring back the oil of spearmint! Otherwise I will not be buying your mints again. I only liked the spearmint. and you have ruined it. Doubtless this is a money-inspired move. Shame on you.

They used to be my favorite type of Altoids until this New Great Taste came and ruined them. This new flavor is not sweet at all and just tastes all-around disgusting. It's bitter and tastes like those foul cough drops that. no matter how bad a cough I had. I would never make myself take. You took a wonderful thing and changed it for the worse - much worse. Please revert back to the old recipe!

I just bought a dozen pack to stock up and they were New Great Taste! but curiously bad.  Oh My Oh My. these are bad.  Don't like them at all. AND they are Naturally and Artificially Flavored.  Why did you ruin a good product?  Could I trade you these New Great Taste! Same Punch!  For some old really great taste and delicious. I can't even give them away. no one wants them once they taste them.<br /><br />To your new great taste ... I say NO THANKS.  I'm done with Altoids if this is your way of changing a good product.  You show the old box on your web site but that is NOT what is now in the store!<br /><br />They are way stronger than the US dollar at the moment.  If uncle keeps borrowing money. mints can remain curiously supreme.<br /><br />By the way. my favorite is Ginger but of the mints. it WAS Spearmint.

I just got a new tin of the New Great Taste!--which is horrible!  It tasted like menthol!  Such a drag.  I see now that there are more artificial ingredients in it.  WHY???  I hope the company sees  the feedback and reverts back to the original recipe.  Or they'll lose a lot of customers.  They've lost me for now.

Undoubtedly the Americans though they could save a little money with the crummy new ingrediants found in theirnew  phony  Spearmint mints.

I love fruit strips as a low-calorie snack for my sweet tooth cravings. I buy Stretch Island for my usual snack because I like the flavor & price. but these definitely are more tasty and they have a lot more Vitamin C. However. they are a LOT more expensive - 10 per box - so they are an occasional treat.

I HATE raspberry. even the actual fruit so. I'm very happy I tried this flavor - my usual shipment of Sparkling Orange was unavailable/out of stock or I probably never would have. I have the orange on Subscribe and Save and I've REMOVED it after tasting this flavor! Now. I just hope Amazon.com will put THIS flavor on the S & S program so I can buy it that way. [...]

I can highly recommend the Dagoba Chai chocolate bars. The delicate snap. warm melting milk chai-flavored chocolate and crunchy crystallized ginger makes this a highly memorable experience. The spicy chai flavor is completely unique and makes this chocolate a little more exotic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Even though the photo shows the fun size. these really are long single tubes and are 70 calories per tube. if that matters to you.  A little bit of false advertising with the picture. but still the same sixlets!  Very good.

50570,B0000DGG22,AGKUW5GIDYSG2,Matt,1/1,1338940800,Healthy tree and packaged well,I received my Dawn Redwood Bonsai yesterday. and I was impressed on how big it was. From the base of the plant to the top it stands at about 24. The plant arrived unharmed from the packaging and was very healthy looking. From the packaging to the saran wrap over the soil to hold in the moisture. you can tell someone took great care in packaging this plant before sending it and I couldn't be happier. Now we will see if I can keep it alive :)
50587,B0000DGG22,A12QW86BSC53R2,Morbid,0/0,1304812800,Dried. Green. then Dried again.,Quick review:<br />When I received this bonsai. it was well-packaged but very brittle and dry. I unwrapped the packaging and watered it. I did notice some spider mites in the soil but I don't know how to get rid of those.<br /><br />Also. I had to remove some brittle branches and within 3 weeks it finally green some new ones and very nice green leaves. But about a month later it quickly dried up and it seems to be dry again. I did water regularly and gave it plenty of sunlight (without ever burning the leaves). I will try to revive the tree again and will update this review in a month.
50593,B0000DGG22,A2RID6LR7JGN2S,D. Blake Huffman,0/0,1238976000,Perfect,I got this tree in the Winter time and it was in great condition.  All of the needles fell off almost immediately but they've all grown back now that it's spring.  The pot is real ceramic and it was fully covered with moss over the soil.  I've seen the pot alone for $30 so this was a pretty good value.

50658,B0033HTCEW,A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,Angela Evans,0/0,1313280000,perfect with pastas or as a snack!,These are the best sun dried tomatoes that I have found for several reasons.  These reasons include:<br /><br />1) Not packed in oil:  The first reason I love this product is that the tomatoes are not sun-dried and then packed in oil.  Many sun dried tomatoes come in large jars and have some type of liquid substance preserving them/adding flavor.  These do not.  They are dried and packed tightly into these little plastic containers.  The absence of oil makes these healthier and cleaner to work with.  Even though these lack a liquid component. there is still a softness to them.  They are not rock hard like some of the bags of sun-dried tomatoes out there.<br /><br />2) Little waste: The second reason I love this product is the size of the containers.  At 3.5 ounces. you have a manageable amount to use.  You don't need to worry about waste.  When you have a massive jar. once opened. the tomatoes are only going to stay usable for so long.  It is easy to use a 3.5 ounce container with one or two recipes.<br /><br />3) The taste:  I love the taste of these tomatoes.  A nice salty flavor accompanies them. but the salt doesn't overtake the phenomenal tomato taste.<br /><br />4) Perfect with pastas:  I love to make pastas. especially pierogies.  Perogies happen to taste wonderful with wilted spinach and sun-dried tomatoes that have been sauteed in brown butter with salt. pepper and some broth.  You don't need to stop with pastas though.  Try these tomatoes on salads and with sandwiches.  Each container has a recipe printed on the back of the lid.<br /><br />5) Perfect alone: The user doesn't have to feel a need to be creative with these tomatoes because they are perfect on their own.  Counting calories?  Mix up your daily eating routine and include a pack of these sun-dried tomatoes.  They have 225 calories per container. have a good deal of fiber (16.8 grams per container) and potassium and vitamin C.  Disclosure:  These have a good deal of sodium (300 mg per serving and there are 7 servings per container).<br /><br />6) Portable: Take these on a car trip.  Because the containers are made out of plastic. they won't break.  You don't have to worry about your children breaking a glass container and injuring themselves.  Again. because these are not packed with oil. you don't have to worry about liquid substances being splashed all over your car either.<br /><br />7) Packaging recyclable:  These tomatoes are packed in 1 PET plastic. which is readily recyclable in most areas.<br /><br />8) They last:  Because these have a lot of salt and are well-packed. they remain fresh for a very. very long time.  I've purchased large sums of these tomatoes and have had them sit for months unused.  When I experience a sun-dried tomato craving. I don't worry about the freshness because they have such a long shelf life.<br /><br />In sum. I love these tomatoes.  I use probably two packs a week for recipes and casual snacking.  I love that they are packed without any type of liquid and the containers are sized just right for recipes and/or casual snacking.<br /><br />I purchase these 3.5 ounce containers for about two dollars from my local grocery.<br /><br />These tomatoes are a product of Turkey and should be refrigerated after opening.

BPA-free and the price is right. but very very bland,These are not beans you want to eat right out of the can. but they are delicious in red beans and rice recipes or in pasta fagioli or in soups. where they have a chance to soak up a little flavor.  And they're just about the healthiest things in the world.  They are must-have staples around my house. where getting my ten year old to eat anything that isn't made out of meat or potatoes (or cake) is a challenge.  He likes these beans.

50670,B000GZU7SY,A3HMASG2SPTV35,S. Maughan,7/9,1263427200,A disappointment,While finding a line of salt free beans at a reasonable price was great. I have had a hard time using up these kidney beans. they are mushy; unpleasantly so.  You'd think they would make a good bean in bean soup or refried beans. but I didn't think so.  A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough  - but what isn't.  Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.<br />I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy.  I've learned to either cook my own and add just a touch of salt or use a 'low salt' product.  Color and size are good.
50673,B000GZU7SY,AQIXCVBW3RFMH,liu1966,1/1,1327363200,7 dented cans,Just received a shipment and there were 7 dented cans. Two were so badly dented that I discarded them.<br />More than half of the beans were stuck together and came out broken and mushy. The previous orders were<br />great. This one was not good at all. The current $20 price rise is a SHOCK. Subscription canceled.

It has large coconut *shavings* in it (not stringy shredded cocount. or miniscule flakes).<br /><br />The coconut flavor is robust and significant.  So if you're looking for something with just a hint of coconut. this probably isn't for you.  But if you're looking to gorge on big coconut flavor. this is the hot ticket.  I LOVE coconut. so I love this cereal.<br /><br />If you live in Southern California. I found this at my local Mother's Market for less than $4.  On sale. it was only $2.79.  Significantly cheaper than Amazon.

In addition. I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand. at all times. which contains eight cans each of grilled beef. turkey. and chicken. each in their own savory sauce.

I've only been using the product for about two week now and I'm seeing big difference in my hair.  I use it as a part of deep conditioning regimen and let me say when I complete the overall process of conditioning. shampooing. and combing or brushing through my hair I have very little breakage.  If I don't use it as a part of my DC regimen than. I'll use some to a cheap conditioner as a prepoo to soften my hair for about 35 mins.  True the smell isn't the best but for the work it has done on my hair it gets my respect.  I will warn you the first ingredient used in this oil is mineral oil. so for my natural ladies who are scared of that. you may want to try the powder form.

Royal Canin for Persians has been perfect for our two cats.  Its easy for them to pick up. They enjoy the taste. but don't over eat. They've had no digestive problems. urinary infections which can be a problem with an all dry food diet. Their skin and coats are healthy and fur balls are minimal. They have it packaged with a resealable strip which helps keep it fresh.  I'm very happy.  And its a Great Price!

Prepare each as directed on box and then combine.  YUM!!  And of course. my Amazon Prime membership guaranteed me quick delivery.  Thanks for always having what I need Amazon.com!  :)
50879,B0041FTQWI,A3L0Q0D434JPZG,Digital Junkie,0/0,1322870400,Jiffy Cake mix Review,I ordered 2 packs of this stuff for my mother because it is hard to find in local grocery stores where i live. She uses it to make something (a dessert) called chessbars. They are absolutely delicious. I will definitely be reordering again from Amazon when she starts to run low or run out. I love Amazon. They sell everything. LOL
50880,B0041FTQWI,A28MVRT54BMZ91,K Martin K Martin,0/0,1316304000,Jiffy Cake Mix,I received this order very quickly.  I have not actually used any of it yet. but unless the mix ends up having bugs in it. I'm assuming it will be fine.<br />I cannot find this product in the grocery stores anymore & like it to use combined with the Jiffy cornbread mix for some great tasting cornbread.  (If you want to try it - just use 2 boxes of the cornbread mix & 1 box of the cake mix - follow directions as far as what you add to them. bake & enjoy.)
50896,B00139C3P2,A1TWZ4MJQM6W2V,The Amateur Librarian,0/1,1332633600,Didn't hold their attention for long,I chose this for the quality ingredients.  At first my cats liked it but about halfway into the case they stopped eating it.  I left it out. thinking they'd get hungry enough and eat it eventually. but they never did.<br /><br />After a while. I pulled out a can. hoping they'd want it again. but nope. they're done.
50956,B00139C3P2,A2H1PZXDIEN6OM,dmh,1/1,1278979200,Kitty approved,I have a senior cat (18 years old) and her teeth are not in great shape.  I switched her to an all wet food diet about 2 years ago. and Newman's is the best wet food that I've found on the market.  She is also fairly finicky. and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods. some more costly than Newman's. and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free. the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.
50969,B00139C3P2,A2OUNVRPRWH0,Master's Kittie Bliss,2/3,1299888000,good product. too pricey here,even the less expensive flavors. at the discounted subscription price. are more expensive than I get them at the local grocery store<br />people will say you save on gas for the trip. but I go to the store anyway. so no savings there. really
50972,B00139C3P2,AC2FS4YS2GRN1,VT Strong,0/0,1349654400,All our cats love it!,I've tried a number of all natural/organic wet food brands for my fur babies. and they seem to like Newman's the best. They wont' even touch some brands. and when I'm spending over $1 per can. I can't afford to buy food they won't eat. Newman's seems to have really good ingredients that I can feel good about giving them. they all love it. and it's priced reasonable on Amazon. compared to the $2/can for organic stuff at my local stores.
50975,B00139C3P2,A3MXNMXKGS5QHK,D. Carter,0/0,1349308800,Inconsistent in product quality,This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it. When we opened this new one from Amazon. it didn't smell the same as the last batch. this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.
50976,B00139C3P2,AA157EV59BJGM,domenico luvera,0/0,1348617600,Formula Changed,The Newman's Own Organics 2nd Generation Turkey & Vegetable has changed the ingredients from Turkey Liver to Pultry Liver.<br />This is not good if your cat is allergic to Chicken as ours is.<br />The Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable original is no longer available.
50992,B00139C3P2,A38YA49SPMUSAH,Anon.,0/0,1276300800,Good product. great deal!,Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff. although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date. I've only opened one can that was watery-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received. including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months. I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box. packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous. but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact. but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment. if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall. I would buy this product from Amazon. again.
51005,B004AHCD8G,A2LLBTUK4S6QDG,westsign,1/1,1342137600,great product,The product was such a great price. and it made my food taste so good.  I had a hard time finding this product elsewhere.
51010,B0001G6VNS,A37E23HY7RLGXF,AK-AK,3/3,1262908800,Best Pancake mix,I have tried many mixes and this is the best tasting. and probably best for me. mix I have tried.  I would give Red Mill a star less.<br /><br />This product also mixes well with other ingredients- like corn meal and corn. blueberries and nuts. and so on.  The mix plays well with other ingredients. is filling. and tastes great.  I have not had a better pancake (and I have tried a lot of mixes and made from scratch)in 20 years.
51013,B0001G6VNS,A2FWZ58M6IQMD7,Doc Stew,2/2,1244592000,Best tasting. healthiest pancakes I've ever had,These are. without a doubt. the BEST tasting pancakes I've ever eaten in my life.  Oh yeah. and by the way. they're SUPER healthy!  I make a batch that lasts about 3 days. and eat a couple every morning.<br /><br />The only problem is trying to find this mix in a store - I haven't had much success. You can order via Amazon directly from the manufacturer if you don't mind the high shipping cost. I'd recommend looking in a Whole Foods or some other natural grocery store. Definitely worth trying to find!!
51018,B003J8LUPE,A1LXKUC9LHBECP,the mentor,1/1,1339718400,Awesome,This is the best tea I have ever tried and I ONLY drink tea. It gas a unique flavor and is very mils.

51083,B000FIXT2I,A1ULMWQW1GRDVA,Susan Scott,2/20,1261958400,gross,I bought this rice because of the reviews that said how good it was.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This junk is nasty!!!!!!!
51095,B000FIXT2I,A2MAHQDH67WL4H,Rachel,9/10,1173571200,Great Product,I am hooked on this product.  It tastes good. is good for you. easy to prepare.  I add some cooked beans (lima beans. corn. etc.) and a little butter.  It makes a great lunch.
51098,B000FIXT2I,A30LNW85ZH0YHY,Angelique Adams Diva Las Vegas,5/5,1170115200,Great Tasting.Fast Cooking.Very Convenient For Those On The Go.,I started a High Fiber diet in order to lose weight/feel better at the beginning of the year. I am not a vegan or vegetarian.just a woman on a busy schedule who is trying to overhaul my eating habits.<br /><br />This is a very good product.easy to take to work.school.etc.It is a lot more convenient than cooking brown rice for close to an hour.especially on nights when you are busy and/or cooking for one.I throw some stir-fry seasoned veggies on top.and just eat it from the bowl.Also.with a little brown sugar.pecans and raisins it makes a great alternative to oatmeal in the mornings.Before this.I had tried Uncle Bens quick brown rice pouches that you microwave.which were nasty--salty .oily and too much fat. All I can say is just try it.you will be pleasantly surprised.
51101,B000FIXT2I,A3PD8JD9L4WEII,Bron Bron,3/3,1330732800,Wow!  You all were right - this is great stuff!,First. my sincere thanks to all of the others here who took the time to post a review.  I never would have tried this rice bowl except for the overwhelmingly positive reviews here.  Even so. I really felt like it was a gamble.  So I'm happy to say this stuff is great!  I'm not a big health food nut or anything. but I am trying to eat healthier.  I do like rice. so I was looking for a simple. quick. instant rice type product when I came across this.<br /><br />Yowzer!  This is great stuff.  In my 1000 watt microwave. 60 seconds was all it took and I had a hot. steaming bowl of slightly sticky brown rice that was close to perfect.  For the purposes of this review. I started out eating just the rice as is right out of the microwave.  The texture was great and the taste excellent.  Now rice alone does not have a great deal of flavor. but the subtle flavor was very good and exactly how I would want my brown rice to taste.  So all good and I'm already thinking 5 stars for this rice for being so handy. convenient. easy to fix. and tasty.<br /><br />Next I was thinking about having some salsa and chips. and I thought. hmmm...salsa and rice?  So I spooned some medium salsa into my rice bowl and stirred a bit and voila!  A very tasty meal!  I don't think it gets any easier than this.  This stuff will make the perfect base for a variety of tasty meals and fairly healthy ones at that.<br /><br />A big thumbs up and 5 stars for this one!
51110,B000FIXT2I,ANFSR1JTBQDJO,coolmommy,2/2,1269388800,Quick Convenient Lunch for Work,I love these for stashing in my desk drawer for a quick lunch at work and keeping in the pantry for when I don't have nearly an hour to cook brown rice at home. The flavor's not bad by itself. but remember this is plain brown rice. Add a bit of leftover chicken. veggies or a dash of sauce to round things out.
51117,B000FIXT2I,A353IAF5Y1XE53,J. RIGOR shop mama,1/1,1339977600,YUMMY!,I am asian and I am used to white jasmine rice.  Brown rice is a healthier alternative so I tried this product.  It tastes different from jasmine rice but it fills you up quick.  Another thing I like about this product is it is ready in 90 minutes. It is good tasting too unlike some brown rice that tastes like uncooked oatmeal.
51132,B000FIXT2I,AA3WMVS7B6M5X,Scott Goodale,3/4,1275868800,5 stars for the rice....,...but I ding the overall score for the excess packaging. The bowls are in a cardboard box which is fine. but the cardboard box is placed in another cardboard box and the excess space is filled up with platic wrap. I understand why this is done. the manufancturer sends the rice boxed and Amazon boxes it again. All that aside. this is a good value and the rice is very good. Also convenient if you don't feel like using a rice cooker or stove top. These are a convenient. quick and nutrious way to get some quality carbs!
51145,B000FIXT2I,A1QT29JCR0G70T,Theresa,0/0,1338422400,Great Bowl of Brown Rice,How convenient and a great price.  easy to use.  I take them to work with me and heat them up.  I usually have curry or soup with the rice.  it's perfect since I'm trying to eat healthier.
51149,B000FIXT2I,AKFGOAMHWKDV9,Noelle,0/0,1332374400,Yum,This brown rice is very similar to the quality of rice you would recieve at PF Changs. a popular asian bistro chain.  These are great for lunches. as they do not require refrigeration.  I tend to make a quick stir fry from leftover meats and veggies and pour it over the rice for a super fast meal.
51157,B000FIXT2I,A2PC1SNL5GFDDV,larry,0/0,1318809600,yummo,This is good stuff.....who the heck has time to make rice in a pot? I guess some people do.....but I sure appreciate the convenience and good taste!

I've never had instantly steamed organic rice before so I was a little take back cause the rice has a very sticky quality. but I add some organic spices and a teaspoon of organic butter and it's awesome!
51186,B000O2EBGI,A3MGIJS37PQ4M7,CrimsonCrow,2/2,1196035200,Life saving,I had a 4 pound starving. adult feral cat arrive in my house a year ago. Her fur was falling out. her bones showed and she was diagnosed with FLUTD. After feeding her this food for the last year she is free of FLUTD. has the softest fur I have ever felt on an animal. save a chinchilla. and has maintained her weight at a healthy 9 pounds in spite of being an indoor cat.<br /><br />This food is well balanced. made from excellent ingredients and puts to use the latest in nutritional information about cats.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />Regarding frugalone PJ's review: No one knows for sure why some cats get FLUTD and others don't. Many potential causes have been hypothesized. including viruses. abnormal urinary retention. obesity. bladder defects. and-the most popular theory to date is improper diet. In reality. one or all of these factors might play a role in the occurrence of FLUTD.<br />--maxshouse.com<br /><br />(I have no affiliation with maxshouse.com)

51214,B001DLFAAK,A1K5KHJRKINCP,Paul Cassel,0/0,1345507200,Great Color But Little Taste,Some of us can curl our tongue while others can't. Some can cross their eyes while others can't. The list of some can while others can't goes on and on. Why am I bringing this up? Simple: I get almost no taste from this tea. I note the glowing five star reviews from so many others (which led me to buy this tea) which I interpret to mean that they can taste some element here which I can't.<br /><br />I will give this product kudos for being the best looking tea I can ever remember seeing. It's a gorgeous dark red color so is aesthetically pleasing at least to the eyes. However. to my taste. the tea has a weaker flavor than even the mildest green teas. It isn't a patch. flavor-wise. on this company's excellent Yorkshire Tea or Twining's Irish Breakfast -for two examples.<br /><br />My recommendation is for anybody unfamiliar with this tea is to order the smallest amount possible. You may be in the group which finds this tea to be wonderful (the majority here) or you may be like me and find it almost tasteless. In case you are like me. being stuck with 20 or so servings is bad enough. Being stuck with something like 100 or more would be vexing to say the least.
51217,B000JFGHHQ,AOWEZTD98JK08,cliftonia,10/12,1277856000,Delicious favorite,Nice selection of flavors.<br /><br />blue - tastes like blue!<br />green with yellow center - sour apple<br />orange with white center - orange cream<br />white with black stripes - anise/licorice and it tastes good too!<br />white with red stripes - peppermint<br />red with red stripes - cinnamon<br />brown. white - chocolate vanilla<br />yellow. pink - strawberry banana<br />peach - peach (wow)<br />brown. white. pink - Neapolitan<br /><br />Six packs will last a long time.
51230,B000E0K7NQ,ADRBR0OSINW6T,DDRPam Pam,1/1,1335916800,I want to love this but...,I decided to switch from a salon brand to the damage therapy shampoo and conditioner from dove. (Previous shampoo was making my hair poof. ugh).<br /><br />The first time I used it. I thought I found a keeper. My hair felt silky smooth and looked shiny. I guess it also made my hair a little limp. But for someone with thick. wavy hair that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />My problem started a month and a half after using this. I couldn't go a full day without my hair feeling grimy and super greasy looking. Yuck! And I can't wash my hair everyday because it dries out my hair and scalp too much...On day 2. I'm afraid to be seen in public lol.<br /><br />(My hairstylist said it's from the wax they use in the conditioner to make your hair look shiny and not add volume. Although. I don't see it listed as an ingredient.)<br /> Back to the drawing board :[.

Was nice to be able to buy a small size since I wasn't sure how they would taste since I think they are new.  The recipient loved them.  Said they were really good.  Maybe try a small bag if you think it is something you would like.  Most of the Jelly Belly candy has been delicious!  I know the unbearably hot cinnamon bears were a big hit!
51264,B0050JLFVO,ADJPQDEEFKETK,Marion,1/1,1340928000,Okay. but...,The Royal Canine PD dog food is great; however. the food I ordered was supposed to be 'Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Canine Hypoallergenic Potatoe & Duck Dry Dog Food.' but the food I received was just the regular Royal Canin Potatoe & Duck. 7.7lbs Dog food + Shipping came to almost the same price as I would pay to get the 16lb bag of Royal Canin from the local PetsMart. I haven't been able to find the 'diet' food anywhere and I was excited to find it on Amazon. but... little disappointed.
51269,B000F4F96Q,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,R. Kyle,4/4,1210896000,Refreshing and just the right sweetness,For some reason. this is a hard tea to find locally.  It's a delicious mild black tea with a slightly sweet bite of blackcurrant flavoring. According to the label. you get your antioxidants with your caffeine.  It's soothing and delicious both hot and iced.  This is my personal favorite of the berry teas so far.

51291,B001M1Z0T2,A214DG8Y09M3W9,Michelle Devon ~~Professional Dreamer,0/0,1344297600,Watch Out for Hidden Sugar In This Blend!,I love. love. love this blend... I think it's amazing for cooking. putting on a baked potato. and my favorite. seasoning popcorn! It has a spicy kick with just a hint of sweetness. and lots of chile smoked flavor. The problem is that hint of sweetness. I use the Mrs. Dash blends because I'm on a low-sodium diet due to congestive heart failure. but I'm also by choice doing an all-natural diet. and many of the Mrs. Dash blends are a great way to season without guessing on measurements and such for spice blends. but there are some hidden culprits--for example. one of their blends has potassium chloride in it instead of salt. Well. this southwest chipotle blend is amazing in flavor. but it has SUGAR in it as one of the ingredients. Unfortunately. as much as I love it. the little bit of a sweet kick that I loved about this blend actually IS sugar and that means it's out for me. I don't eat sugar.<br /><br />But for diabetics. or those who are pre-diabetic an are watching their sugar. this product--that one wouldn't think would have sugar in it--clearly does list it in the ingredients. So be sure to check your labels on the Mrs. Dash products. because. while they are a great alternative to salt and can teach you to acclimate to more flavorful and healthier herb blends for seasoning your foods. sugar is processed and not great for you. so this flavor is one you'd have to skip.<br /><br />Otherwise. if sugar isn't an issue for you or your diet. I do highly recommend this seasoning. Seriously. try it on popcorn... amazing. I'm sad I can't have it any more!

Gebhardt,3/3,1239494400,Love this tea!,Began drinking this tea while living in France. gorgeous smell with a bit of a sweet taste. very relaxing (and I don't usually drink tea)! It really is exceptional. I haven't been able to find it in the US. so excited it is sold on amazon.com.
51295,B000F4F96G,AVYV7GG3JUKT3,Scope,1/1,1199664000,Nice medium flavor,Could use a slightly stronger vanilla flavor. It is a medium strength at this time. No funny aftertaste.  Very good with milk.
51296,B000F4F96G,A38C5G3RT0T7QA,A Living Jewel,1/1,1170633600,The Best,I saw this tea on sale and bought it.  I haven't stopped drinking it since.  It is absolutely great.  I don't even need to sweeten it.  I just add a liitle soy creamer and my sweet tooth is gone.  Absolutely Lovely.  I am so glad Amazon.com has this.

51311,B004EI4DVG,A1MWAC9MSHY8D9,Adam,0/0,1350604800,So good!!!,Wow this stuff is good. I have been dipping chips in it and eating it straight from the jar. It's that good.
51317,B0000CERXB,A31TUNLVC933PA,R. Wilson,0/0,1223769600,Pina Colada Tea,Very tasty tea. Almost like a snack you can eat out of the bag but DON'T. Smooth and doesn't need too much sweetener.
51338,B0014UAHQM,A3KQ9HS0D646J2,Marta Bachynsky,9/9,1256688000,Bad batch of Stevia,Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually. I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak. so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh. well. better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.
51347,B0014UAHQM,A332IXNLDMV2XR,Ladyfingers,3/3,1212192000,Great stuff. fast service,The Stevia Extract arrived quickly and was much cheaper than what we get at the local health food store...even with the shipping.  Good buy.
51366,B0014UAHQM,A2NP8P5F0ZORNJ,iknowcauseitriedit,1/1,1339891200,Stevia is great,We use a lot of stevia and I find the Now brand to be less bitter and dissolves more evenly than some of the other brands I have used.<br /><br />If you like stevia. check out this book;<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VXFDQA>Easy Stevia Recipes</a>
51379,B0014UAHQM,A2BBFA2LS61V9I,R. Blowe,1/1,1236211200,NOW stevia extract,As a healthier alternative to other sweeteners I have tried. stevia extract fulfilled the billing it had received.  I had been led to this brand (NOW) because it reportedly had less bitter aftertaste than other brands and I found that to be true although there is still a slight undesirable aftertaste.  Stevia provides sweetness but a different tasting sweetness that takes some time to get used to.
51398,B0014UAHQM,A38VYNWVBHIIKK,Mark Johnson,0/0,1299283200,Best Stevia powder,Best stevia extract powder. The price is a quarter of the price in Trader Joe's stores per ounce. I love this product. Use it in deserts. tea. coffee. smoothies. etc.

51430,B0009G2GRK,APP9BONH1GQSI,K. BATES-ERIKSON,1/5,1279065600,EXPIRED IN 2007?,The reviews for this product on other sites are quite good...I must say I cancelled my order here when I read the product description and saw that the expiry date was 2007..holy smokers. it's July 2010!
51459,B004HOLD92,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,jjceo,0/0,1339027200,Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!,These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just. WOW. bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein. 5 grams of carbohydrates. 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium. vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body. heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!
51465,B004HOLD92,A2N2X7L7LB3S6X,Chris,0/0,1337558400,Great Flavor....,I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors. Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me. these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.
51516,B004HOLD92,A3U5Z6UTIJ8FZ9,1.5 Trick Pony SuperDuper,0/0,1263513600,Perfect snack. perfect size!,I love salt and vinegar chips. but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross. but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips. and are amazingly good. and the fat is the good kind. and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store). but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1.200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach. but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal. but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!
51520,B004HOLD92,A7QHS47420UIQ,Deborah Cartwright D. Cartwright,0/0,1249430400,Blue Diamond Jalapeno Almonds,I love these nuts and it seems that most stores carry all flavors but the Jalapeno. I won't hesitate to order these again if I cannot find them next time. gotta have 'em!!!
51537,B004HOLD92,A4JSQFCKVKX2A,J. Kort,0/1,1271548800,The 2nd Best Nut of Man,My fav bold BD almond by far. Completely addicting. TY Lord that they are pretty expensive. Not the best nut though. That distinction. of course. goes to Mauna Loa garlic and onion fav Mac.
51547,B004HOLD92,A2LUMWYGAOS4ZR,Vance Oglesbee,0/9,1323907200,Nasty,I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce. buy this product.  The nuts are of a high quality.
51623,B004HOLD92,A48Y67R94V2KH,Teresa,0/0,1344729600,Amazing Taste!,I absolutely love the new bold Salt & Vinegar almonds by Blue Diamond! It just doesn't get any better than this!
51630,B004HOLD92,A3PX9L8ICHU0GA,lindaokc lindaokc,0/0,1340323200,addictive taste,The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy. but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.  It's been hard to stay out of them and I eat too many in a day.  The price from this seller is stellar and about the same price (per lb) that I find at walmart for a small can.<br />We will re-order soon as the almonds are almost gone  :-)
51646,B0002PHEU2,A3SKAFBSU9OK1K,J. Hanson,2/2,1275955200,Great cinnamon oil,This stuff is great.  It might be more expensive than the cinnamon flavor or cinnamon extract you get in the grocery store. but it is so much more concentrated that it works out to be cheaper in the long run.  I made cinnamon hard candy.  To 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup I used 1 teaspoon (see update below) cinnamon oil.  That made a strong cinnamon flavor without being really hot.  Yum.<br /><br />Update:  The first time I made this I added the cinnamon oil when the candy was still 290F.  I got a cloud of cinnamon steam in my face and perfectly flavored candy.  I just tried it again but I let the candy cool slightly before adding the cinnamon.  I got less steam (but still a lot) and candy that was WAY too spicy.  I assume that the first time a bunch of the cinnamon oil evaporated. so the amount you need depends on the temperature of the candy when you add it.  Next time I am going to add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon to the slightly cooled candy.
51675,B0002PHEU2,A3GJZ3OUNKW7L9,rainabba,0/0,1346371200,Not quite LorAnn quality. but for the price it's good quality.,Say you want to demolish a small house. An nuclear weapon will get the job as well as anything so why not use it? Just because it works doesn't mean it's the best solution or the most cost effective. A nice chunk of C4 might work just fine. This stuff is C4. I've been a consumer of LorAnn Cinnamon oil for over 20 years and I've never found anything as potent or as expensive.<br /><br />For 8oz. $25 was too cheap NOT to try. I entirely expected to be disappointed but for the chance I wasn't. $25 was worth the risk. I'm accustomed to paying ~$2.50 for 1/8oz (1dram) of LorAnn oil which is ~$20/oz. That makes this product 8 times cheaper. In my opinion the flavor is about 90% and potency is about 85% that of LorAnn's version. Since LorAnn oil is powerful enough to actually cause dangerous reactions (like extremely hot chili peppers). that can actually be a good thing. I'm conditioned to both well enough to consume things most people wouldn't dare try and this oil is still strong enough that I handle it carefully. The flavor is a bit more like that of RedHot hard candies rather than overly-intense cinnamon (which is the best way I can describe LorAnn cinnamon oil).<br /><br />If you're into cinnamon toothpicks or candy flavoring. I can't imagine this being anything less than sufficient and for 1/8th the cost. you have to at leave give it a shot. They have smaller quantities if you don't want to risk $25.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll ever spend the premium for LorAnn again now that I've had this. but then again. I have the equivalent of 64 drams now and I don't think I've used that much cinnamon oil so far in my life so it'll be a while before I have to purchase again :) The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it's not a 100% substitute for LorAnn cinnamon oil. but I wish I could give a 4.5 or 4.75 stars instead of just 4 out of 5.
51717,B0002NYO20,AM0P7V14MB9NU,M. A.,0/0,1323302400,Really enjoying this lavender,There's nothing like the scent of real lavender! Just a whiff smells so good. Besides enjoying the fragrance. I've only used a small amount a few times to make some tea but it is wonderful! Can't wait to try it in ice cubes. add a pinch on top of a dessert. throw a little into homemade laundry soap. or whatever else comes to mind. Would definitely buy more!
51725,B0038YE6AK,AM2JDWS3UK93,Rizos,2/2,1290038400,Amazing,I've had insomnia off and on for the past year +. I've been prescribed just about everything...including the main stuff like ambien. Ambien. unlike what the commercials promote. left me with horrible hangovers. terrible mood swings...and often times I would sleep walk/do things that I didn't even remember. I've also tried in store stuff like tylenol PM or sleep aids you can find in your local drugstore...really. nothing worked. Finally I discovered Dream Water from a random amazon search and found some at Duane Reade. It works (no pun intended) like a dream. I sleep well with little to no hangover at all...no mood swings...and it doesn't knock you out. It slowly relaxes you into a sleep. as it promotes. After all this time...a more natural remedy. and one that's not cheap necessarily. but definitely cheaper. 5 stars. no doubt about it.

51802,B003D4ODH6,A1WMM1GEYKY4UH,Todd F. Gordon,1/1,1291248000,good. but expensive for quantity,we don't let our children drink caffenated beverages - or soda that has plain sucrose (sugar) in it. in large quantitie -<br />so Knudsen's spritzers are perfect - fruit juice and sparkling water - what could be simpler.  And the flavor variety is great -<br />different than standard juices - they like almost all of them.<br />However. on a unit basis. this is expensive juice.  where cans of soda can be purchase in bulk below 20c per 12 ounce can - Knudsen is getting about<br />$1 per 10.4 ounce can.  So on the value side. a bit tough to swallow (pun intended).  Knudsen used to sell 12 ounce cans. and they were actually less expensive.<br />but they discontinued them....  I guess they wanted to make more money.
51809,B000ZM34MO,AHH1RXH7LCBN0,Brian Cox,0/0,1349827200,Good Deal,Product was delivered as advertised and quite quickly at that. I feel quite safe with a 500g (1.1lb) jar of Manuka on hand. so none of these fancy designer plagues scare me at all (H1N1. SWINE. MRSA. Ecoli. etc..). I've combined my medicine cabinet with this and some .9999 (four nines fine) silver rods to do some colloidal silver.<br /><br />Since this is the MGO 400 grade (Bare minimum grade of Methyglyoxol in honey). this is meant for more serious illnesses and burns. If you're looking for something for occasional health prevention. 250 grade is more advisable (manukahealth also advises this on their parent website). Ordered from Amazon because you have to register with manukahealth's site to order... I've ordered from this company before (got the 250g MGO 400 grade before). great service and exceptional product.<br /><br />If you're seeking a tasty jar of quality honey. find a beekeeper near you or shop at a farmers market or local coop. Manuka Honey is MEDICINE. not something you spread on your toast. I however actually enjoy the medicinal manuka taste. no qualms here!

I am not sure about it serving four - more like three. but then it could be we loved it so much a little bit more was appreciated!<br />The ingredients are simple and pure - just the way we like it.

The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item. and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded. I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website. it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund. the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived. I would have likely been happy with it.

This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough zing.

52079,B001IW0ASG,A1ICCUV4TQWLSX,E. Lerner conspicuous consumer,1/1,1231200000,Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray,I received the bottles of Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda in great condition. and they are as good as when you get them in NY.
52081,B001IW0ASG,A2LS7LATD5V36V,bumblebee,2/4,1257206400,Lacking fizz,I ordered this as a gift for my husband. who loves Cel-Ray but can't find it locally. Unfortunately the bottles appeared to have frozen during shipping -- some still had ice chunks inside when I opened the box. Even worse. some had leaked. making the box bottom sticky and soggy. Most of the bottles were fine. but a few were flat when opened. probably from being frozen. I'd look for cans instead of bottles if I ordered them again; I suppose they could lose their fizz too. but at least it would avoid the soggy mess.<br />As for the flavor (which was new to me). it was better than I expected - definitely a recognizable celery component. but in a pleasant way.
52086,B001SAYOK8,A36MSKUYC93B05,David Godbe David G.,0/0,1294099200,Indispensable,This is a great multi purpose sauce.  It not only adds spicy zest to your food. but also adds flavor.  Use it in all your cooking as well as a table sauce for breads. veggies. meats. or anything you can think of.  A table without Saigon Sizzle is not fully set!!!

They aren't that great for cooking at all.  They have an odd residue coating them that you can get rid of with water. but then the seeds are useless!<br /><br />Stay away if you want quality seeds to COOK with. I'M VERY HIGHly informed on quality seeds.
52106,B001EPPXFM,A34YIM97DS1VW9,tewpo,7/7,1333065600,No longer colorado spice seeds,These are no longer Colorado Spice Seeds. Colorado spice seeds were the best. Unwashed with a crisp. peppery taste. These are no longer those seeds. Otto's are just soggy. heavily washed seeds. Nothing good. just run of the mill stuff. Overpriced at this quality. I won't buy again. This ad is deceptive.

However. the product could be a little cheaper. I know the containers and printing cost money. but still.  In anycase this company is excellent.

52163,B002OK2FCA,AS13FS6YS5ZAQ,Dove,4/4,1308441600,~*~ Yummy Sunny Seed Butter ~*~,I gotta admit when I first tasted Sunbutter. I wasn't thrilled.  I guess my tongue was just rejecting this slightly new taste--this isn't nut butter. barks my taste buds. lol ;)  But it just took a time or two after that for me to become quite pleased with this new spread.  In fact. it's now become one of my staple goodies.  Besides now loving the flavor. I also love that it's organic and it has not a dab of sugar.  Note. this is just the ORGANIC; I think their others have sugar--just remember green lid is on the organic.  I love it on whole grain crackers drizzled with local raw honey.  And to keep my carbs/fats/protein balanced. I also usually add some chocolate rice protein.  As well as some healthy sea salt and a teaspoon or so of ground flax.  I blend it all into the butter. then spread.  I really doctor it up. but that's not to mask the taste--which is great on its own--I'm just big on the healthy stuff :-)  Another great thing about sunflower butter (and oil) is that it's a good source of vitamin E and also has magnesium. a mineral many of us need more of. And if all of that isn't enough. I also re-purpose the green lid.  It fits (pretty well) a cute glass salsa jar that I also re-purpose (keep nuts in them in the frig).  Oh. also I keep all my seed and nut butters in the frig on the door. and I think the sunbutter's consistency is improved (thicker) by doing so.  The company also suggests doing so to maintain freshness.  So there ya' have it. enjoy! :-)
52171,B002OK2FCA,A29OHNAOF3WUFT,Joyce,0/0,1333584000,Delicious,This SunButter spread is absolutely delicious. I enjoy it for breakfast. lunch or anytime snack. Great value for the excellent quality.

It is delicious dark chocolate. fairly sweet. and then the bread gives it a hint of salty goodness.  Plus it's Theo's so it is guilt-free as far as being a conscientious consumer goes.

I have got to say this prime rib roast was the best ever! You have got to try it! Our roast was almost 10Lbs and we fed 12 adults and 5 kids. the left-overs tasted as good the next day! We had Philly cheese steaks with au-jus. You will not be disappointed!

52266,B000P49A0W,A28X7NZ02016FO,eCognition,44/50,1247788800,The price of erythritol and oligofructose have nothing to do with it.,Both of those sugars can be purchased cheap at any low carb online store (netrition has it for $7.50 for 1 lb!). and if I can purchase it that cheap. then you KNOW they're getting it dirt cheap.  The price is high because low-carbers are desperate for sweets that won't add much to their daily carb intake; and Low carb specialties (the makers of these bars) know it. I've purchased these bars twice before and loved them; but I took the price personally.  Yes. it's true. no one forced me to purchase them. but that's besides the point.  You end up feeling like prey every time you see the price of your favorite items through the roof when you're desperate for something sweet.  EVERY producer of low carb sweets pull that stunt; however. you'll find all your non-sweet products. such as condiments. etc.. moderately priced.  It's no coincidence.  If you have the time. purchase ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate from Amazon. add a sucralose sweetener (Please see JJ's recommendation below)-preferably in liquid form. so there's no carbs-. add some cream. melt and you're done.  You just saved 2/3 what you would've payed for these chocolates. Any other sweets you find online can be duplicated with minimal effort as well.  Just google it and fatten that purse.

52300,B000I04D5K,A3QHJ0HHLTZT92,chemdaxs,0/0,1329436800,Citrus flavor is nice....,These arrived quickly and were quite fresh. The individually wrapped fortune cookies were well sealed - each baggie around the cookie was full of air. protecting the cookie and its uniformity. Maybe i'm going into a little too much detail here. but the jiist is - there weren't any broken cookies. The citrus flavor is faint. but pleasant. While I do think the standard vanilla cookie tastes better. it's a welcomed flair. Be forewarned. these cookies just show up in one big box (see picture) with the cookies loosely packed. so make sure you've got a storage space for the bulk. and a tray/dish for a dozen or so you'll want to keep in the pantry.
52316,B000I04D5K,A270KAGORS4O9I,Marlena Little,0/1,1308182400,Loved them,I absoultly love these fortune cookies.  I didn't have any that were broken in my box.  Will buy again

This is a deal that can't be beat!
52320,B001HKZZ6Q,ABAHKMFEHT8K1,Gerald Balmes Jerry B,5/5,1271462400,Big Bold Taste Yet Mild,I like to drink my coffee with Half & Half and a sugar substitute; with that. I find this particular coffee rich. bold and full bodied yet smooth. without an offensive after taste that bites back. This is similar to Van Houtte Costa Rica Tarrazu light roast; but slightly stronger. Both I could drink all day long. I don't like a coffees who's after taste last with you for long periods of time; but yet. is very favorable. If you like V.H Costa Rica Tarrazu. give this one a try.<br /><br />This winner gets a spot in my top five favorites list. Which is not an easy achievement.

No explanation. no place to enter discount code. Thought it might be on the next page. pressed the buy button and owned the product with no chance for using the code or cancelling my order. If you have to trick people to get them to buy from your site. you can't expect me to be a future customer. Also. for as much money as Amazon makes. you should be able to afford better programmers.
52336,B001HKZZ6Q,A35X9GNTREXACG,James M. Hommel,0/5,1274054400,Dutch Amazon Coffee Drinker's Club,When the Dutch went to the Amazon. they found this amazing bean that was accidentally crushed. boiled and sipped for medicine.  Soon others started drinking it in the morning and their day was filled with joy and energy.  Being enterprising people. they found that by not killing the insects nor putting additives in the soil. that the bean magically turned organic.  From the dirt to the cup if you will.  When merchants from Vermont finally arrived. they named this amazing drink Van Houtte Cafe Amazonia.  America soon became the coffee drinking nation of the world.  One of the insiders nicknamed Starbucks moved to Seattle. and the rest is history.

52376,B001ATFGEU,A3BAV1734AM7AH,Rick Maczko,2/2,1249430400,Want your dog dead?  If so. buy this product!,I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food. it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these gourmet chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time. they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag not for human consumption. wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product-made in China would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat. which caused bloat because nothing could pass. salmonella and e-coli poisoning. and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery. 7 sets of xrays. 2 ultrasounds. multiple blood tests.an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery. tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past. never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart. which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you. Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering.

52436,B005UFUXRA,A33AQPJYH7UUXR,Desert Gypsy A Brooklyn Girl Out West,1/1,1331596800,marvelous marzipan,Neideregger makes the best marzipan treats that I've ever tried; these little loaves are very dense and have a wonderful almond taste to them. This brand has the truest almond flavor in my opinion and is less sweet in a good way than lower quality brands. They are enrobed in a thin coating of dark chocolate that is just enough of a contrast in flavor to heighten the almond flavor. Although this is shaped like a traditional candy bar. they are so rich I tend to eat them as shown in the picture. a small slice at a time. If you like the flavor of almonds this is definitely an excellent confection to give a try.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

New Hampshire [...].  I imagine the storage and longevity needs of mass-produced boxes of candy require some amount of wax to be added to their formulation.  But once you taste the alternative. you'll never want to go back.
52460,B003YFCZCO,A27EO7IYR55BP3,Beth Nordberg,0/0,1321488000,Very Yummy,I love these crackers and first bought them at Costco. They are great plain. they are great with cheeses. Costco recently (this month 11/11) stopped carrying them. I dont remember how much Costco was charging but I would guess it is less than the options here on Amazon. But. if you're looking at these and willing to pay the asking price provided they're tasty crackers - well. they are!<br /><br />The salt / herb / crunch balance is perfect. Not bland. Not too salty. I think they are great.

I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life. but it was discontinued.  While on the dental diet she never needed to have her teeth cleaned.  I decided to try the Science Diet brand.  She seems to really enjoy the taste of it.  I mix it with some smaller dry food and she picks out the large Science Diet food first.  It's too soon to see if it will work as well as the Friskies on her teeth. but hopefully it will.

Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now. I DO feed my cats wet food. so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic. let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks. no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that stuff is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she. who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee). also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.
52552,B003ANFMY8,A966L65JSN8XN,N. Schleif night owl,0/0,1323820800,Only food my cats can agree on,This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats. two Maine Coons who get hairballs. and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to improve the recipe or change it in any way. or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it. Science Diet! It's a winner as is.
52566,B003ANFMY8,ANZFXLN68V2XK,TK,1/3,1289347200,Excellent cat food,My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a healthy pet. you should do a combination of dry and wet food.<br /><br />The critics have unrealistic nutritional expectations if they are only feeding their animal dry food.
52575,B003ANFMY8,A3O6KWUXYFECY0,Maria,13/33,1289001600,BAD. do NOT buy!,Chicken by-product. corn gluten meal. and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah. I'm NOT feeding my cat that. sorry. Googling corn gluten meal shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent  5.030.268. If you Google U.S. Patent 5.030.268 you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken. turkey that humans won't eat: feet. neck. spleen. intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts. correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods. I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn. wheat or soy at HALF the price.

52602,B004X8MZHQ,A38AKD7TL2WWCR,megan welsh,0/2,1338508800,Did Nothing,I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

52628,B000HDL1OY,A3MYVX2D2UP5U,grasshopper David in Tampa,0/1,1229040000,Great soup but tooooo much salt,Why do soup makers kill us with salt?  why cant they let us put some in if we want it.  i ended up doubling the water and adding split peas to try to get the salt content per bowl down.

52675,B0093A5XC8,AJFSW7DOMQ3KQ,Donna A,0/0,1349395200,A Fabulous Frothy Dessert-Pumpkin Pie Matcha,I had some excitement at my mailbox yesterday when I found my package from Red Leaf tea and I knew my  Pumpkin Pie matcha had arrived. There was a bit of fall in the air and I love pumpkin pie. so I had high expectations.  I opened the packet and immediately knew I was going to like it. since the scent was delicious. I decided to make a chilled latte. so I mixed a teaspoon of the matcha with 2 oz hot water and whisked it until it had some froth. I then put it in a shaker with 15 oz unsweetened almond milk. a splash of cream. and some sweetener. Added a few ice cubes. and Wow. fantastic!! Pumpkin pie without so many calories. I am amazed at how well it captures the real thing. A fabulous frothy dessert.
52689,B0017T2MWW,A2YHXAZLCLDT8D,Mark Smith Food lover,4/4,1271808000,Great tea !!!,Number one in Japan .. and number one in my book<br /><br />It is so great now I can save 15 % now and get it shipped automatically every month.<br /><br />No more lugging it in from the car !!
52699,B0017T2MWW,A1VDMV8AYV5LDR,madeline macgregor green poet/farmer,2/2,1281052800,Refreshing and healthy,I love this product. It's so subtle. that at first I didn't recognize any flavor. I think the American palette is so used to sweetener in everything. that it is harder to discern what foods or beverages taste like in their natural state. However. once I sipped slowly. Ito En's delicate and light quality was bliss for my taste-buds.<br /><br />It just feels good to know you aren't ingesting sugar. in any of its unhealthy forms. either through high fructose corn syrup. GMO sugar beets. or even fruit juice sweetened drinks that are high on the glycemic index.<br /><br />This tea is what it says on the label: tea! Yum.<br /><br />I even went ahead and placed a case on a monthly auto-order to save on shipping and price. My only regret is that I can only buy enough to have a bottle every-other day. I may go through withdrawal symptoms on those days when I can't drink my Ito En!!!!
52704,B0017T2MWW,A3EI1OFE51Z98U,Herman G. H.,1/1,1337212800,Great Tea!,If you like pure. unsweetened green tea this is the best out there. Absolutely love this stuff and recommend it to anyone. It gives me great suttle energy and I believe it even enhances my cognitive thinking.
52710,B0017T2MWW,A1UWX4NRDWCRIM,Kathy Thiel sock woman,1/1,1282521600,Teas tea rocks,We love Teas tea and they are expensive around here. when they are available.  Wonderful to have them shipped to our doorstep.  So far they are the only tea I have found available that is not sweetened and tastes just like tea. no weird after-taste or funny flavoring.  DELICIOUS.  Thank you for offering this tasty tea!!!
52711,B0017T2MWW,A245G0NZ7ZGR8O,L. A. Lasman,1/1,1277510400,Great Japanese Product,The just right quantity of Japanese Green tea to be able to either drink at one sitting or save for later.<br />It tastes great because it is not sweet.
52724,B0017T2MWW,A2Q6HI7RV0PYQG,Chamorrodan,0/0,1311724800,Best Genmaicha ever,I used to live in Japan for 2 years during my Marine Corps enlistment.<br />Oi Ocha was always in every public vending machine.<br /><br />For those who like a good unsweetened Green tea. this is for you.<br /><br />Roasted rice enriches the flavor of the whole green tea leaves and water.<br /><br />I also noticed for the first time that one bottle has 120% vitamin C per serving (2 servings).<br />So aside from all the healthy stuff you get from Green tea. it's just an added benefit.<br /><br />I'll definitely keep ordering this.
52747,B0046QPBPS,AMY5ZW8JYJGBN,Sofia,5/5,1306281600,I haven't ordered these beans yet but...,...if you buy lupinis in salty brine you're supposed to rinse them in fresh water before you start munching. That's probably what the italian restaurant had done too. (The huge amount of salt is there to keep the beans fresh.)<br /><br />Hope you didn't throw the lupinis away!
52768,B002N3EIZ0,A8YWQ6B36SEAM,TMB,1/1,1322438400,GREAT SNACK! So happy I finally found it online!,Finally found these awesome chestnuts! I've tried both the regular and unshelled type. must say they're both great! I use them on the go. when I want a healthy snack and just don't have the time to pack something. Give it to my kids all the time and they love it too.
52770,B002N3EIZ0,A1FC6F84SFBUC,Jingyi Song,0/0,1345420800,not good,IT TASTES VERY BAD. a little sour. Besides. the chestnut has peel.<br />AND there is only a little in a package!<br />not suggested.
52794,B000E1DS90,A1FP5ZLSKR07SU,G. Burnick,3/3,1195171200,Super-licious!,Wow. good tasting and creamy just like 'real' pudding. The banana cream  is my favorite of these 'diet' treats along with the cheesecake flavor. Both are also perfect pie fillings. Very easy to prepare -- and ready to eat in minutes.<br /><br />The butterscotch and pistachio are surprisingly satisfying. too. while being sugar-free/fat-free. The chocolate flavors are quite good as well. but don't dissolve/set as well as this does.
52802,B0005ZXPY8,A239BIP124VPYJ,Gone2lunch,4/4,1306540800,Please. Sir. I want some more!,If baking soda is ever found to be toxic. I am totally boned.  I use it for cleaning my body. hair. teeth. hard household surfaces. laundry (as an add-in). and dishes. and also for de-stanking the cats' litter boxes.  The only downside to this product is that it isn't bigger.  I've used store-brand baking soda occasionally and I understand that it's the same thing. but the consistency is never the same as A&H.  To me. this is exactly the right consistency:  fine enough to blend into a recipe or solution but sufficiently abrasive to clean. when used that way.  It's even replaced my $xx Philosophy exfoliator and does a better job.  Yes. the big box can be a hassle. but I've purchased or re-purposed lots of smaller containers. china saucers and bowls. even silver salt cellars (which it keeps brilliantly un-tarnished) and when repackaged. it looks very exclusive and special.  Who needs to know it's pennies an ounce and good for everything from the epidermis to the loo?
52803,B0005ZXPY8,A1L6Q8E1PNMN2G,Mary Ingram,2/2,1315353600,A Product we cannot Do Without,We all know that baking soda is good for probably thousands of things<br />beside cooking. Recently I have had sinus problems and my gums one side<br />of my mouth was literally killing me; i.d been chugging down lots of<br />aspirin. Then surfed the net finding that a baking soda paste might<br />help and I thought. well. here goes nothing but it worked. I had had sharp<br />pains so thought I would put this in here just in case some other poor<br />soul was suffering like I was.
52809,B0005ZXPY8,A75BRNG1IV1EX,J. Niblett lady jane,0/0,1299196800,laundry,I make my own laundry soap and this item is a must.<br />Sometimes hard to find in a large size.<br />Great quality item for a lot of uses!
52831,B0000DIXKU,A2VJ7TPQUTP2PQ,ChamisaLady,4/5,1294963200,YUM!,My English husband asked me. while consuming half-a-pound at one sitting. Do you have any idea how much this meal would cost at the Savoy? He felt fantastically indulged. so we are both happy.

52850,B0009YWM5S,AAYCBHMJOWPBD,C. Bailey,2/4,1156982400,Represented incorrectly,I had to return this item. because it was represented on the website incorrectly.  I was looking for the original beef recipe. not the new one. and was delighted when I found it on Amazon (both versions were shown as available).  My cat has a health problem that requires this specific food.  I compared the ingredients. the label. and all the details for a match before I placed the order.  I was very careful.  When I received the cat food. it was the new recipe (not what I wanted).  Apparently. the old recipe is not available at all anymore. so the item should be removed from the website.
52867,B002GWH972,A1WR1HZCBA0NCG,J. Wayne Nosa Fishing,1/1,1311206400,Excellent Coffee,I am a big coffee drinker. and wanted to give this a try given the price.  It is very good. regardless of the price.  I found the description to be accurate. and the seller delivered as advertised.  My opinion of the coffee is that it has a good strong flavor while still being smooth.  I just ordered my second bag.
52884,B000HDJZOM,A3M8R4JD1SIS76,'MaryLou Cheatham The Collard Patch,4/4,1214352000,Beware the Salt,Bear Creek Country Kitchens Chipotle Soup Mix is a delicious explosion of flavor.  It's great by itself. or you can add things such as corn. jalapenos. sour cream. grated cheddar. chicken. pork. and avocaodo slices.<br /><br />When I eat this soup. I want to have about two cups of it.  There are only 110 calories per cup. but there is a problem.  One cup of this soup has 850 mg of sodium.  That is 36% of the daily value recommneded.<br /><br />Although I love the Southwestern flavor and my family serves chipotle soup to me as a special treat when I am a guest in their home. I find it necessary to warn you about the sodium.  The directions say salt and pepper to taste. but it already tastes a little too salty.  The ingredients include MSG. a serious souce of sodium.<br /><br />As our doctors tell us. elevated sodium in our diets is one of the causes of high blood pressure.
52885,B000HDJZOM,A2142R31D1PRSY,FittobeBooted,0/0,1290297600,Love this soup!,We love this soup in my home. I tend to add personalized ingredients to prepared meals. and this soup is no exception.  I always make a double batch and add chicken. diced tomatoes. rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro. and a can of corn. My family and friends love it. Some of them have also begun to use it as a base for experimenting with their own personalized additions. as well. It has the warmth and soothing tone of comfort food. It's even good for breakfast.
52897,B000RI1W4I,A1ZK0OUUCEL0L3,Kenneth R. Mitschke,0/1,1232323200,Great Size,Great size and great taste. One bag (100 calories) is all I need as a snack to get me to the next meal. Recommended!
52911,B001B02JF2,A29F97JJM9IZ1F,J. Baisden Sandwalker,0/0,1315180800,My picky cat LOVES this food!,Finally!! A food my picky eater will gobble up!  She absolutely loves this food.  And it is good for her too.  Made only with high quality ingredients. I feel good about feeding it to her.  She is now the perfect weight and she looks great!  I will continue to feed her the indoor formula.<br /><br />PS: She turned her noes up on five different (canned and dry) foods before attacking this one!  She is THAT picky!
52921,B0048IAE5G,A39BCFAZ05RYPY,Cirroc,1/1,1330128000,Wonderful Snack,Gluten-free. vegan. and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain. lightly salted. triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors. colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks. after you eat a handful of them. you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving. I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.
52932,B008UF5JQC,A1LS24QED1KGKH,C. Snyder milli3,0/0,1350432000,double bagged,Chia seeds are great. I am glad they double bagged them. the zip bag the came in had a small hole on the side. there would have been chia seeds everywhere.
52936,B000ZSWR80,A3PUPHJ6PYZJV0,K. Caldwell poor old me,2/2,1267315200,Sugar-Free Licious!,Sugar-free taffy I think is better than regular. but be careful of eating too many at one time.  I find the smaller portion size easier to eat.  The assortment gave me a chance to try flavors I've not tried before. which I liked as I fell in love with the cinnamon and the licorice flavors.
52950,B0057FSX7U,A241MJV79A4J5O,RCS,2/2,1347408000,Love this product!,I have been buying and using both the Comstock no sugar added cherry and apple pie filling for years and we all love it.  My whole family is eating healthier nowadays and it makes a perfect light dessert. It has just the right amount of sweetness and just 30 or 35 calories for a decent size serving.  I use it in my home-made pies because I can't make the pie filling from scratch any lower calorie than Comstock does!  And I love the consistency of the product.  I also use it alone. warmed up in the microwave with warm vanilla sauce that I make.  A great quick dessert.  Unfortunately. both supermarkets in my area have stopped carrying it!!!  I was so pleased to find that Amazon did have it!  It's a little more expensive than it was in the stores. but I can deal with that as long as I won't disappoint my family by not making pies anymore.  :)
52960,B004754DO8,A289RVKKYSSVLC,reva Horton,3/4,1327017600,My dogs love these things,Our dogs will eat these until there are no more left in the bag if I did not dole them out to them as special treats.<br />This item is the real stuff and is made in America.  Watch the label as I accidently got a product that was so similar at Wal-mart I did not notice until I got home that it was made in CHina.  Beware of dog foods made in CHina..They have been warnings concerning their safety lately.

53004,B001652NBM,AYFD7LW553YIU,Diana A Choy,0/0,1314316800,Good but some packages were missing,ordered the 4-12 packs. 2 of the 4 boxes only had 11 packs. Kinda odd to have this problem in one order.
53012,B001652NBM,A101HSNF12PR4Y,Maggie,1/9,1313366400,Wrong quantity,I only got pack of 12 but not as it was said pack of 48.because my husband placed this order.  When i got the package i just felt strange they used a so big box for this small stuff.. and I  did not realize the quantity was wrong until today I checked my account. But  now I already finished most  cookies .and I think everything is late .
53013,B001652NBM,APP8XWYYV4PAA,Debra Chong ECommerceMaven,2/13,1248480000,Little filling. disappointed in quality of product,Oreos have gone downhill in quality. Little creme filling and mostly chocolate cookie. Recommend Newman's equivalent. much more filling and great tasting.
53018,B001G4R0LQ,A3VE28JZM94SI7,Ana M. Medina Ana,2/4,1292976000,The Best Chocolate Treat EVER!!,My boss gave me a box of truffes in this specific brand and package for Christmas today.  I tried it during my break and it was simply the best chocolate treat ever!!! I wish I could make this creamy. chocolatey. mouth-melting flavor. and stamp it on anything with chocolate. because it is perfect. The packaging is great because it comes in four bags which believe me. it's more than enough for a party. If you really like chocolate. but have been discouraged by brands that are too sweet. bitter or oily (Lindt).  buy this and you or your gift recipient will truly enjoy this gift!!! This is so good it's indulgence itself!!!
53033,B000G1EO0A,A14MF2Z7RUVKVV,Danesh Amuz,0/0,1289952000,Very disappointing soup,This soup lacked flavor. color. and seasonings. but the worst part was that the lentils were so mushy I didn't need to chew. It was incredibly disappointing. and so bad I nearly wrote the company to complain (I decided it wasn't worth it - it wasn't entirely inedible. after all). I'm shocked at how many reviews are raving about this unappetizing soup. Definitely try it from the grocery store first before you get stuck with a ton of cans.
53041,B000G1EO0A,A7SL39O14RRF5,Mary K. Ross,2/4,1274313600,Dented Cans,Over half of the cans were dented and you can't return. Won't be ordering from Amazon again!<br /><br />This is great soup but you should buy it at your grocery store.
53056,B001HY9RD4,AEZO4A6I7PMBE,frank,1/1,1335225600,Natures Best by Science Diet,My cats have been eating this food since it came on the market. It was by far their favorite. Retailers no longer carry the product because they claim it was too pricey. I purchased 4 bags on line through Amazon and was disappointed. The bags were ripped and the food looked different than usual.  None of my cats wouldn't eat it. Will never use this service again.

53079,B006YVWW2S,A35FBTN1J2CYRR,C. Barnes Realtor,0/0,1348099200,DOG DID NOT LIKE THESE TREATS!,Some dogs may like these chicken meatballs.....but my pickie Morkie said NO WAY!  I could not get her to even eat one of them!  Maybe I can try to disguise them by putting them in some chicken broth or something...but that's allot of trouble for me and still no guarantee she will eat them. Giving them to someone else who has a dog who will appreciate them is probably the way to go! Sorry...for some they may be good...for others they may not.
53085,B0000DCWWI,A169DNROT1Y5V5,Thomas ITpro,2/2,1283990400,Pretty Hot. Only For The Experienced.,I've been a fan of Dave's Insanity sauce for several years and decided to try the salsa.<br /><br />It does have a consistency more of a taco sauce than salsa.<br /><br />If you've had Dave's Insanity Sauce or Ghost Pepper Sauce. you know the heat level you're in for. Insane +++. If you aren't familiar with Dave's Gourmet products than I would advise working your way up so you can at least eat habanero peppers without issue. as this is several steps up from those.... or at least get the sauce and try a half-teaspoon at a time/per dish until your mind is acclimated.<br /><br />Very good. Great flavor. Tastes like they put 3/4 salsa in it and 1/4 DIS.<br /><br />Highly recommended. although your first try at it I'd recommend on a day where you have the next day off (IE intestinal turbulence + horrid gas).<br /><br />I love it but anticipate it'll take a few months to go through a jar.

This summer my neighborhood Walgreen's was selling this gum along with Clove and Beemans (two other nostalgic flavors). I kept buying pack after pack of Black Jack. which was getting expensive. Then. I wondered if I could find more than one pack at a price that was economical. I searched the web and Amazon has the best price so far. So now I am buying the 20 pack. Black Jack is the only gum I chew. Now if only someone started manufacturing Chum Gum again. I would be in gum heaven.

53154,B001BCUBFK,A3DLQ022J4KZR5,E. Yang,6/6,1251158400,The dog seems to love it,I have a dog who is a very picky eater. I'd been giving her homecooked meals for about three weeks. but the vet said that I should get her something more nutritionally balanced and more geared towards canines. I got this one because it looked like it had good ingredients (i.e. the first ingredient isn't corn meal) and it was a reasonable price. Normally. my dog won't eat dry food for nearly two days (no joke) after she's had homecooked and/or wet food. To my pleasant surprise. she started eating the food within 24 hours. She's been on it for a couple of weeks now and she doesn't seem tired of it.
53166,B001BCUBFK,A1NDYNE3BYCBAF,Pat L.,0/0,1349654400,Castor & Poillux,We have been using this food for both our dogs for 2 years.  They are happy. healthy & have great coats. They never have digestive problems. which is of great importance to us! I means they are using all the food. w/o fillers.  We would recommend this food to everyone! The home delivery is acceptional and always on time.
53167,B001BCUBFK,A2I0MB3AJ70373,T. M.,0/0,1347580800,Picky puppy...,My dog loves the Lamb Ultramix but hates this formula! :( I will never purchase it again. I may even switch brands because the only food he kinda likes is the lamb. My other pup loves the Grain Free Ultramix formula so she will stay on that. I just may have to take this at a loss and get rid of the food.
53172,B001BCUBFK,A3O92VFSXB8S5Y,Ashleigh,1/2,1329004800,Wish we could love this food.,I have three dogs a ten year old Mini Dachshund. a 1.5 year old boxer. and a one year old hound mix.  I wanted to LOVE this food because of all the great reviews and how healthy it seemed.  I loved that it had bits and pieces of peas. carrots. bananas.  My dogs seemed to really enjoy the food and ate a lot of it. BUT... my boxer developed TERRIBLE smelling gas.  I mean. enough to clear the room.  Some nights I had to sleep in my daughter's room because it was so bad it would wake me up from a dead sleep.  My dachshund started to develop really bad breath. which can be common in small dogs as they get older. but her breath had no smell before being on this food.  My hound mix's hair started to thin and fall out around the base of her tail.  It just seemed too coincidental to start having problems with all three of my dogs after starting this food.<br /><br />So we switched back to Eukanuba Adult dog food after trying out the C&P Ultramix for about three or for months and ALL of the problems have disappeared.  Well. the dachshund's breath is still a little funny but NO WHERE near as bad as it was.  The boxer still has gas. but it is back to the point to where I only hear it... I don't smell it.  And my hound mix's hair looks good again.<br /><br />Do I think this food is terrible?  No. it seems to work for a lot of people and their dogs.  It just didn't work for us.  I wish it did.  The auto delivery option was so convenient. great service.  It just wasn't for my dogs. I guess.
53212,B0078TRYIW,AIPLK6NWBFV92,nena,1/1,1330300800,mmmmmmfor chocolate lovers you gotta try this one,I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate. but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift. I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.
53219,B0078TRYIW,AUQV6SXM17MLA,Robert Mills Abby Mills,0/0,1332460800,Sweet Deal!,Bought some of these in New Mexico at a co-op store and couldn't find them locally in Florida. Bought on line thru Amazon at a lower price and free shipping. The candy is wonderful and it's truly a sweet deal.
53235,B007KT7VLU,A2U3RPYX0Z36EQ,Mia Silcott,0/0,1342915200,disenchanted,I was looking forward to getting this product. I loved the classic brulee. however the chocolate tasted like chocolate pudding with sugar on top. It had no special taste and it was expensive. I gave this a three star only because the classic is still very good for a boxed dessert. If you are looking for a bargain do not order from this store there is better pricing out there.
53255,B000246RSI,A1FII9WLY0Q5BI,H. Gregg Huey HGHuey,0/0,1322179200,Awesome chocolate!,Smooth and creamy!  Bars are double - two packs.  Not cheap. but well worth the money.  Melts easily so I store in the refrigerator.
53267,B00370ESNU,A2RYZDVU6B7ZX0,The Aster,1/1,1339804800,Awesome!!!,This stuff has managed to become a suitable sub for coke and is probably responsible for about 10 lbs of the 40 I lost. Tastes like a cross between a diet DP and a cherry coke. Since it's more expensive than regular soda. I limit myself to one a day. but it definitely satisfies that craving! Highly recommend!
53284,B00370ESNU,ASC2DYLMA6N0C,Blues Rev,0/0,1322784000,Great Soda,No. it's not Dr. Pepper. but it's pretty darn close. I love these Zevia sodas. I'm purchasing more of this flavor.
53307,B00370ESNU,AZFUYWPD9P8L7,Adam P Donohue,3/6,1279843200,Ugh. Shame on Zevia,I've tasted a large number of Dr Pepper imitators. and Dr. Zevia is by far the worst.<br />I like Stevia sweeteners. you see. and I assumed Dr. Zevia would be delicious.<br />Don't buy it. don't drink it. It tastes like chalky cherry cough syrup. I've only been able to drink it when mixed with Coca Cola or Dr Pepper. and that defeats the purpose of diet soda entirely. doesn't it?<br /><br />I'm not even willing to try the other Zevia flavors. I still have 17 cans of Dr Zevia I can't handle. Blech.
53336,B001E5E0AG,A3Q6Q2MC2ZC07I,Michael D. Moore Mac Insomniac,1/2,1326931200,The very best cold cereal you can buy,This has to be the best researched and best constructed cereal ever produced for the mass market. As other reviewers have said. all aspects of human health were addressed. it is very tasty with great textures. Ever since I bought my first box. the only time since then I ever buy other cereals is when U is not available. Even the box and the ink are cutting edge as far as environmental concerns. I feel good for hours after eating it. and heartily recommend it with Tempt original hemp milk for that much extra omega 3 and 6 (it tastes great with moo milk as well). The retail price when not on sale is about $4.99/box- expensive. but worth it. the bulk price is much better. and if you buy enough to get free shipping. it's a great deal.  Since U is such a wonderful product. you may not want to eat any other cereals. in which case a 4 pack will only last a couple of weeks...
53339,B001E5E0AG,A18OKW70N0HL0P,G. McCammon,0/1,1300147200,Geat Taste & Healthy Too,We really enjoy this cereal. Not only does it taste great. but the ingredients are good for you too. particularly the black currants and walnuts.  The black currents are real black currants and not raisins as some manufacturers attempt to pawn off.  I highly recommend this cereal for the flavor and the healthy ingredients.
53340,B001E5E0AG,A2XHGGM9RX14DO,zephyrus,1/5,1331942400,Super fake,This is one of those cereals where the fruit is a mix of 99% grain and chemicals. and 1% extracted fruit juice. If you want a really natural cereal. or one where the fruits don't taste disgusting. look elsewhere.
53343,B005RGOSNM,A2B6RRW1XS7X6R,Denise McMahon gerkeeper,0/0,1330992000,Very Nice and Pretty too!,While the large chunks gave my mill a little bit of hard time. the extra effort was worth it.  The flavor is superior and the slight bluish color is lovely.

My family loves these and they are so fast and easy to make their a perfect addition to any meal. I bought two boxes of 22 packets which per unit came out cheaper than when the market had them on sale. They're a great buy!
53350,B000EMM9YY,A2A6SB596ROUZA,R. Williams,1/1,1267056000,My Kids Love Them,Our local grocery store quit carrying these a couple of years ago.  My daughters were crushed.  I found them on Amazon in December and bought them a case for Christmas.  They were absolutely speechless.  I was a hero.  I hope Betty Crocker never quits making these.  I don't understand why the stores won't carry them.  We should all call distributors and make a stink.  Now. I wanted to order them from Amazon again and they're not available.  My daughter wants more of them for her birthday.  Please Amazon. get more of them.  Make my little girl happy.
53351,B000EMM9YY,A195DVGYHOKWOM,Bonny Harvel,1/1,1189382400,Amazing product...Amazing price,This product is definatley true to the name complete...They turn out so melt in your mouth good that they don't even require butter!!!! They are simple to make and fool proof....Plus with the free shipping and no retail markups much cheaper than buying them at the grocery store. The case I got had a good experation date and I have no doubt that we will devoure them long before they expire.
53360,B0029JLS7E,A8GP8M3F69GCS,bama from Huntsville Bama,2/2,1275091200,Great Value for a LOT of M&Ms,What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks. desserts. etc. where you don't want to sit and eat 300 of them...
53395,B004521SK0,AHNSJQQW7FJSJ,D. Venables,0/0,1335657600,great beer. not 12 oz cans,The beer is the best of three brands i have sampled.  The cans are 330 ml which is not 12 oz as the product description says.
53403,B004BRYVJY,A2V7S51520P1CL,Roadtripper,0/0,1345680000,My favorite chip ever!!!,So so so good.  Seriously addicting.  Have to disagree with the reviewers who said they were spicy.  I think they taste kind of sweet.  Super light and not filling.  Love them.<br /><br />I have never reviewed (what basically is) a potato chip before in my life.  I guess there is a first for everything.
53408,B005HYRA9I,A2IZ0XXB94I6OW,K. Holcomb-densmo,0/0,1326067200,Great,I was surprised that the bottles are large enough to hold a substantial amount of sauce. and everything you could possibly want is included! thanks

(edited because NO longer available in prime),Perfect...just a little something sweet to keep you going...no aftertaste of any kind.  (Because of the reviews. just ordered the berry and orange...can't wait to try those. too.)  Great tasting sugar free candy is not always easy to find...this one hits a home run.  And as a bonus. the box is adorable..easy to pop in your purse. :)<br /><br />***************************<br /><br />No longer available in prime so that takes care of that item.

53456,B001BOOKW8,AJ7HPLHB2A5M0,Theresa,0/0,1319155200,Love these!,I love these little licorice candies. and have a hard time finding them anywhere.  They are small. and not too strong like some licorice lozenges.  I was glad to find them on Amazon. and for a reasonable price.
53458,B001BOOKW8,A3J5IKBQOHNJ8G,S. Griffith truth reader,0/0,1317859200,LOVE them!!!!,These are yummy!  But don't eat more than 1 box a day as they can cause diarhea from the sorbitol in them.
53474,B001E5E0A6,A1Y3XPZK9ZADFW,albinocrow,2/4,1307577600,too dry,I found these in a local grocery story and wanted to try them before buying a larger quantity here. They were extremely dry so I checked the 'best by' date which was 5 months out so I don't think they were stale. But I needed liquid just to wash this bar down.
53476,B001E5E0A6,AD3L1SJHJDZTJ,T. Ayres,0/1,1329004800,Great reasonably healthy option for breakfast,These have excellent flavor.  The blackberry bars are actually better than the strawberry ones.  The strawberry are good too. they are just a bit drier.  We used to really like the Fiber 1 pastries for the kids in the morning.  They had some fiber and tasted much better than regular pop tarts.  Well the Fiber 1 pastries aren't made any more so we've been searching for something else.  We tried some organic/fiber pastries but they were way too dry.  These are finally a good replacement.  I use these to give the kids something eat while I'm getting ready for work.  It does the trick until mom gets up and makes them breakfast.<br /><br />And life doesn't get much easier than Amazon's subscribe & save!
53479,B001E5E0A6,A18RQSU4VRFDHY,LISA PARSONS walking cain,0/1,1318723200,kasha fruit cereal bars,Excellent price for a nice product.  Kashi is a trusted brand for us and I haven't seen a retail store offer a price this good.  We get a shipment each month and its a relief when they arrive.
53480,B001E5E0A6,A7P8JO7MC314R,BoogieMom,0/1,1317600000,Perfect for toddlers on the go,My 3-yr-old hates to sit at the table and eat breakfast. she always wants to take a snack in a cup and run around.  Most days. she would rather go without breakfast than sit down and eat.  I finally compromised and got her some Kashi cereal bars that she could eat on the go.  I was so pleased to find something with whole grains. real fruit and no high fructose corn syrup that I could give her.  She loves them. I love that she eats them and they are better for her than other bars on the market.  I wish they had more flavors than the three I'm always buying. I would purchase more to give her more variety!

53497,B006W5WGFE,A2FC1XLFJUK5D3,R.B. (mom of two girls),0/0,1294531200,Excellent,These bars are very good. I eat one for breakfast every morning. I have tried all the slim fast bars and most of the special k bars and this is the only one that doesn't have a yucky aftertaste.
53510,B0040WHQ42,A3DMF3X6YTG996,Kim,1/1,1329004800,Nice Chai Tea!,Really like chai teas and this one is pretty much the same as the now gone Special Teas. Marsala Tea. This tea is hard to overbrew and has a mild spicy flavor.
53513,B003P9XFSM,A966L65JSN8XN,N. Schleif night owl,0/0,1350950400,My dog hated it,I heard this is a good food for dogs. but my picky Pom would not touch it. I also found a web site about dogs that died from eating this food. so I am confused about the brand now more than ever! It's so hard to pick a good dog food these days.
53525,B000UPALKO,A3IX1QVVNYF1BU,T. S. Femino,2/2,1205625600,Best Drink Mix. Seriously,K2O is by far one of the greatest drinks out there - easy to mix. dissolves amazingly well. very healthily... and it tastes great! Each packet contains a nice 5g of both Fiber & Protein. both of which us most people don't get enough of these days.  Strawberry Kiki is the best flavor available thus-far. unanimously between myself and 3 of my friends.
53538,B000UPALKO,AWOVG1BISZZOP,F. Rodriguez,0/0,1217289600,Awesome drink!!!,Helps with hunger. I drink it instead of snacking and it works. It is hard to find. Amazon has a great price. In NYC a box of 7 is $6.

AvoDerm is the one all three will actually eat and not drop out in the yard!  The caveat is they fancy only the original flavor Kookie. not the other two flavors AvoDerm offers. I have not noticed any adverse affects like gas or loose stools so I will continue to purchase these treats for them so long as I can find them. So far. the big box store quit carrying them. so I get them here off Amazon Prime (albeit a bit more pricey than what I was getting them at Pet*****) I was able to find them on the drugstore site. but they were in a different packaging and they arrived broken to bits. My order from Amazon arrived with all 6 bags snugly packed inside a box within a box so there were zero broken Kookies! Score one for Team Amazon!<br /><br />The ingredients are: Ground Whole Brown Rice. Lamb Meal. Ground Whole White Rice. Oatmeal. Rice Flour. Natural Flavor. Flax Seed. Avocado Meal. Herring Meal.

Each morning each one gets 2 of them and they start the process of enjoying them.  Then after a few minutes they finish with a nice little mess.  I do not understand but near the end of the process they either just get tired of eating them or do not like them or they are suggesting that they want to share the leftovers with us.  Regardless. we always have a few pieces on the floor that have to be vacuumed.  No big deal. however.  There are three treats these critters love:  these biscuits. pig snouts and freeze dried livers.  I would love to have a return of all the money we have spent on other treats that did not make it to the eating condition.  Yorkies are blatantly picky (or at least these ones) and it's one sniff and eaten or gone to the neighbor's dogs.  Maybe that's where the expression gone to the dogs originates.  If you buy food and do not like it then give it to the dogs.  Bottom line:  great for us. love the little plastic container and they love the treats.  We'll be back for more.

Carolina chickadees and more. Thrashers (and other birds) pick-up the fallen pieces from the ground too.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This item really is ~H~O~T~. Make sure to wash your hands after you touch it. . . or even better. . . use gloves.<br /><br />FYI. I recently purchased a Squirrel Buster Peanut Plus feeder. which holds what I call the suet peanut balls from C&S and it works really well. Though they make hot pepper peanut balls. that's really not necessary with the Squirrel Buster. I have one of the large Squirrel Buster seed feeders. which is really great.

I have several suet holders and the birds prefer the No Melt. I have tried other brands as well and in general my birds get more excited over the brand CS. I live in San Antonio. Texas and it's hot right now. I think the birds like the No Melt because it's not messy to the touch.. I have lots of visiting birds; cardinals. blue Jays. woodpeckers wrens. little gold colored finches. House finches. warblers and now a HAWK. The hawk hasn't caught any doves. starlings. or fat pigeons yet but it's sure scoping out all the bird action.<br /><br />I bought this Hot Pepper suet since I just started feeding birds and I didn't want a squirrle problem but so far my dogs keep squirrles out of the yard better than any product so far.
53596,B004LKWH7Y,A3VAF83VTO9EPR,Nicki ~nicki,0/0,1309910400,So convenient,Couldn't find these in any grocery store. but wanted them for a very long plane trip so that I didn't have to worry about mixing bottles on a cramped airplane. It was a life saver. It did seem much thicker & darker in color than the powder formula. but my baby didn't seem to mind :) I was able to get it when we were in the states. but now that we are in Japan and planning a trip back to the states. I find that this item cannot be shipped to me & I am very disappointed.
53600,B0016687F2,A1OG3QEAW69749,Hari Seldon,34/35,1324166400,Great product. but beware.,I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewer say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However. I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably. sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics. the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless. the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are.

Ive been doing 2 scoops with ice. water. and a banana for breakfast and lunch. Snack on nuts and have a healthy dinner and am already down 7pds. I definetly recommend this product. just ordered vanilla ice cream flavor and cant wait to try it. Also I shopped around and this price was the cheapest ive found by almost $10.

I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.

I'm definitely seeing results. however I find it to sickeningly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)! It's like over sweetened cake batter and I can't even stand the smell. However. my husband likes the flavor and is drinking it because he was encouraged by my results! I'm going to try ordering something other than the Vanilla Ice Cream .
53624,B0016687F2,A2IPAQZ8GTU7RC,Steffie583,0/0,1348012800,Alright,I have just started using this supplement after workouts and it has taken me a bit to figure out a taste combo that I can live with. The milk-shake flavor may be a little bit overboard. I would probably like just a normal chocolate flavor. The recommendation is two scoops but I use one and I still feel the taste is quite strong. I mix one scope of this with 2 cups of almond breeze almond milk and sometimes some frozen strawberries - blend it in my blender and it is a great drink. It also provides enough chocolately flavor to cure any possible sweet tooth I might have.

53775,B006SLWY5Y,AVWDMCKI3S96J,Nicolle,1/1,1336262400,Yummy. packaging could be better,Love this stuff!  It makes a French Dip type sandwich what it should be. and it's good for dipping prime rib in too. Like the other reviewer noted you can control the saltiness to some degree by how much you dilute it.  Following package directions I find it very flavorful and not too salty at all.  I was a little disappointed with the packaging and took away 1 star for that.  All the containers were really sticky. and when I went to put them away I realized it's because one lid had cracked and leaked everywhere.  The shipping box and even display cardboard were pretty sturdy so I think the plastic containers the actual sauce is in may not ship well (or. it wasn't handled well in shipping... hard to know). Still a good deal especially compared to grocery store prices.

I also sometimes will add some bits of left over ham too. The package has suggestions of what else you could add to the soup. Also is just great by itself. Great price on Amazon too. Bear Creek is a name you can count on for excellence. Love all their soups. Just so nice when you don't have the time to make you own.

53874,B001S38AK0,A1L4RDILGM7D9E,Paula,1/1,1319673600,Delcious!,This is heavenly chocolate. The flavor is amazing. I have tried many brands of dark chocolate (over 70% cacao). and this one has the most delicious flavor. I like to alternate between this and the 86% cacao. This one is sweeter than the 86% cacao. This chocolate will satisfy you but you may want two squares of it because it's so yummy. With the 86% cacao you will be able to eat one square and be satisfied because it's so intense. The world is a better place because of chocolate!

53888,B00348J5EW,A1P5TI3RAOE207,Cristian Ioan Tiu Real name,1/1,1273017600,Outstanding taste but lots of work!,These anchovies are packed whole in salt. meaning that in order to bring them to the looks of filleted anchovies you are used to. you will have to clean them yourself. Depending on skill. this process takes between 20 minutes to ... maybe 1.5 hours. so be prepared to work hard for your fish. The idea is to place them under running water (from your faucet). The skin will peel and when the water hits the fish around its fin area it will make the fillets part and you could easily extract the bones. This process requires a bit of skill which can be easily gained with repetition.<br /><br />On the other hand. the taste is definitely at par with that of Ortiz anchovies. making the Agostino Recca anchovies the best in the world as well. The fish is fleshy and not overly dry. and the flavor is interesting without being overpowering. The fishy taste also survives the salting in these anchovies.<br /><br />For those of you praising anchovies in salt. I would like to recall the fact that you have a choice of the olive oil to put them in - if you like extra virgin oil with the fishes you can have it!  (most anchovies sold in oil would use a lighter. less pungent oil)<br /><br />Given these considerations. I recommend these anchovies wholeheartedly. but you need to know that you have to work to get them!

It is a medium roast just as described.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee that you can honestly taste.  The only coffee that I like better is the Copper Moon Costa Rican Tarrazu that I have been unable to find.  Enjoy!  This is also a nice coffee for an afternoon break with a taste treat.

Maxwell House.,Maxwell House International Coffee took over the General Foods International coffee line. and the chocolate coffee line shrank to almost nothing. Finally they come out with an attempt to give us back our Mocha. but what a price!!<br />I am being miserly with my order of Suisse Mocha Latte singles because it is the closest I can get to the old Viennese Chocolate mix. but I won't order it online.

The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one. unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter. more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate). slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick. creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside. it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp. when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy. allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.

We have also tried seperating the beef from the beef and cheese and she will not eat that either.  The Beef and Chicken are more than her snacks (it is her primary food) when she is being finicky or when the Grandchildren are around.<br /><br />We received exactly what we needed and are very pleased with dealing with the seller....excellent experience!!<br />Thank you!!

Flours were limited. and choices of prepackaged goods were also limited.  These crackers are of that era.  They do literally taste like eating paper or cardboard.

I currently have three or so bags stored in my pantry.  I keep them on hand. as I cannot have gluten. dairy or soy. and these are an allergen free kitchen basic.  I just open the bag over a large container and slide the noodles into it. then run very hot tap water to cover them and let set for about ten minutes.  Then I take my kitchen shears and cut them into smaller lengths.  When ready to add or use them. I drain off as much of the water as I can without losing the noodles. then lift them by hand into the soup or into a serving bowl.  When I get near the end. I drain off the rest of the water and then pour them into the soup or lift them into the bowl.  If I have leftovers. I store them. covered. in the refrig.  (Use within three or so days.)<br /><br />GREAT!
54095,B000YSQA7U,A2OBV0QBUIVXYC,Shijie Zhang,10/11,1282867200,This honey is exceptionally thin,I have consumed many kinds of honey.  This honey is the thinnest one.  It is so thin that I am suspicious whether it is 100% honey (water added?).

They were fresh. no broken ones. but the cost.  Can you bring the cost down please?
54155,B0017OX0HS,AGMM9FGCAT210,Thren 272 Thren272,1/1,1328918400,Perfect food,Gobstoppers are truly the perfect candy.  And so versatile!  You can roll them around in your mouth for a long time. patiently sucking to get at the sweet goodness within.  Or you can just chomp into them and get a mouthful of almost overpowering sugary tastiness.  Another bonus is that they change colors. so there's that added entertainment factor of trying to guess which color will come next.<br /><br />The rattle of the box has a very appealing sound.  Maybe your cat will enjoy it as much as mine does.
54161,B001UUNDOE,ABNVD3LCNP3NL,J. Riggin I luv the Funky Beats,2/2,1299456000,Healthy & Easy to Cook Wheat Lasagna Shells,I highly recommend these whole wheat lasagna shells. (At the risk of selling out). They are super easy to use. No need to pre cook them. They are ready to go straight out of the box. Wholesome and healthy. these taste great as well. I bought the Rozoni Wheat Lasagna pasta. but they are much smaller in width. They took months for Amazon to send them to me as well. I have not tasted those yet. so we will see how they compare in flavor. But these ones are absolutely great. I will be buying more shortly. The Ronzini ones also have to be precooked before hand. Only for five minutes. but still Lasagna takes an hour or so to make as is. Who needs the extra headache? Try these! Great for families. You can cook a bunch and have a meal for a week.

Redford bookmimi,10/10,1305504000,Delicious. but inadequate packing by Amzaon!,The first time I purchased these tart shells I was very happy with the shells themselves - they were delicious and made such beautiful individualized desserts. but (as previous reviewers had warned) almost 20% arrived to broken too be used.  However. I wanted to try them again and was very disappointed when ONCE AGAIN at least 20% of the shells arrived too broken to use.<br /><br />The Hafner box is well designed. but it was put in a larger Amazon box with one small strip of bubble wrap.  I think that the box of tart shells was tossed about so much inside the Amazon box (not to mention on the UPS truck. etc) that broken shells were inevitable.  But if the original box had been tightly encased in bubble wrap probably most. if not all of the shells would have arrived in tact.  I will not purchase these through Amazon again and do NOT recommend that others buy them here either.

I subscribe and save to these because honestly i eat 12 boxes in about a week and a half.  However. quaker changed the number of bars in a pack from 10 to now only 8!  Same price yet 2 fewer bars per pack. Now with this order I'm basically getting 2 less boxes each time for the same price.  Amazon should have at least warned me that my 10-count 12 pack order was now an 8-count 12 pack order and that i would be paying the same price.<br /><br />I guess its back to buying the variety pack at costco with 60 bars. the downside being the dreadful oatmeal raisin bars I am inevitably forced to eat.  Actually the oatmeal raisin are pretty good. just not at all compared to the chocolate chip peanut butter.

It wasn't as strong as I had hoped. but if you play around with the amount of water used. you can make it stronger.<br /><br />I gave it four starts because having froth in your cappuccino is a critical component. a key ingredient.

I tried Nescafe cappuccino pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods.  Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL.  Bitter. synthetic--like something from a vending machine.  The cappuccino maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately. the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return.  I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is. should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first!

Until. that is. I discovered these at my local grocery store.  I am so happy to report that they taste exactly like a regular pretzel (they are a little bigger then standard stick pretzels but that makes them more hearty)  These are fantastic and a staple in my house.  I frequently catch my other family members snacking on these even though I keep probably 4-5 bags of standard pretzels in the house at all times.  These are just fantastic!

Ours will--including shoes. cardboard boxes. electrical cords. and our clothing (not that we put these things in front of him; he tracks them down).

My fiancee constantly rubs my skin because he says it's so soft.  It does make your skin amazingly soft.  It also keeps it moisturized. . no more dry skin. I'm a lotion and potion queen and I've used every kind of skin lotion/cream/body butters out there and when I lotion down in the morning I'd come home only to take off my clothes and see dry legs.<br /><br />After I use this in the morning and when I get home my legs look like I'm about to do a Venus commercial. (move over JLo). . soft. shiny and silky.  This makes a great hair conditioner as well. I ordered the 29oz of Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil and when I got low I immediately ordered the 54 oz. .it's a must have for my skin.  Don't get me wrong I still use other lotions. but guess what. .the coconut oil gets mixed in with it. I also do chemical facial peels at home once a week and this is a great moisturizer after a peel.  I SO recommend this.

I must admit that mine is better. but having a few packages of this stuff around does save time and does. in the long run. save money.  This is the sort of dish that I have yet to find any individual that actually dislikes it.  I first bought two packages of the near the Tarharah.

I am constantly on the lookout for different varieties of cat food that they will eat. Forget about any of the veterinarian supplied cat foods. My cats' response to those cat foods is consistently. you must be kidding!. The weruva chicken cat food was very well received and gobbled down. But please remember. in the world of cats. variety is the answer! I rotate the foods I feed my cats each day. Just like people. cats do not like eating the same thing day in and day out. and don't hesitate to let you know their dissatisfaction.

Their ingredients are far superior to other off the shelf brands.  Kudos to Amazon for making these available directly from their warehouses.
54522,B001TLY7A8,A2JP6PEBS5Y2WK,T. Ater Timecow,0/1,1321574400,Great Food - Cats Should NOT Eat Dry Food,I don't know why this is not known to everyone. everywhere. but cats should eat a grain free. wet food diet. They cannot digest or get any nutrition from grains. so there is no reason for grains to be in cat food. yet to save money. they put it in. Also. cats naturally have a very low thirst drive. and with the correct diet. they will hardly ever drink water. If they are on a dry kibble diet. they will have to drink to get their water. and with the low thirst drive that is natural. a lot of cats don't get anywhere NEAR the amount of water they need. Cats on a dry food diet are likely to have kidney problems or urinary tract problems that could be prevented just by changing to a wet food diet. This is so important. and I urge everyone who loves their cat to get them off the dry food. and over a couple weeks. switch them to a grain free. wet food diet. Sorry to be preachy. but the word needs to be spread!<br /><br />This Weruva food is a big hit with my kitty. and it is a proper grain free wet food that makes sure he is getting the water he is supposed to get. Yes. it is canned in Thailand. but it is in an all human grade food facility. I would be much happier if it was all done in the US. but it has been reviewed by reputable sources and scored well. The other bonus. at least with the chicken flavors. is that they smell good! No stinky cat food smell. but in fact smells like something you might want a bite of. The cashier at the pet store I used to get this food from said he had eaten it. and it was good! Of course. it is also important to give them a variety. so I give him some of the fishy ones too. but the chicken smells great. I would recommend this food. but whether you feed this one or another one. please feed a grain free wet food diet to your cats!
54533,B001TLY7A8,APJPG5SRY4RDN,K. Dollar,10/10,1273795200,The best cat food out there,I got my cats on this food after I found one of them urinating blood and refusing to use the litterbox.  The vet told me he didn't have crystals. and after two visits they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.  They wanted me to put him on the Hill's Science Diet for urinary health. but I read the ingredients. which include by-products and rice. and decided to do my own research to find a better quality cat food.  I can't sing the praises of this food loud enough.  My cat is no longer straining to urinate. or going outside the box.  I have yet to find a variety either of my kitties don't like.  Just be cautious. if you are looking for a grain free food (which all felines should eat). Weruva does have a couple varieties that contain rice.
54547,B001TLY7A8,A2J8ID5U61YGT9,Billig,2/11,1291075200,Horrible packaging,When I opened the Weruva carton. 5 of the 24 cans were so dented and deformed that I had to throw them away. even though the box itself was unmarred. Buyer beware.

54588,B001TLY7A8,A2PE3EW7F3UFED,E. Cramsey Lizzy,1/1,1339632000,cat goes crazy for this,my cat is almost 10 years old now and I started thinking more about what I feed her.  Admittedly I should have paid more attention to this years ago but believe it or not. until recently. I just thought pet food was pet food.  Gizmo had a bladder infection a year or so ago and after learning that kidney disease is a common and deadly disease for cats. I wanted to see if switching foods would help her ward that off so she can live another happy 10 years or more.  I did research and read all about how dry food and grains is unhealthy for cats and mainly filled with undigestible ingredients.  Grains in the food cause crystals to form in the urine as the cats body tries to process them.  Higher protein foods. grain free and with a higher moisture content are what is best.  I read all the reviews here and decided to try this paw licking chicken flavor.  For starters it doesn't have that gross smell most canned cat foods do.  It seems close to human grade to me.  From the first try of this Gizmo was hooked.  Now she cries for it. rubs around me. sometimes even gets wild if I am ignoring her and jumps up onto the counter to get my attention that she wants to be fed.  After buying 2 cases on here. I decided to try some regular store bought canned food.  I just thought this may be a bit pricey to maintain and she was going through it like crazy.  I tried several different brands from Petco and several from the supermarket.  I tried to get as close to this flavor as possible with shredded chicken flavors and none of that pate stuff.  Nothing!  She will not eat a single other brand now.  She cries and cries and if I set down something different she will sniff it and walk away.  I tried being stubborn and said. well if you are hungry enough you will eat eventually.  Well she won because she actually started to lose weight.  It was incredible.  This 6lb cat won by starving herself.  So I ordered more and she is eating and happy again.  If it makes her happy and it's healthier than all the dried grain filled junk I fed her for years then I will continue to buy it
54592,B001TLY7A8,A3HWYWS120K1S4,My Pen Name,1/1,1328572800,This food turns my cat into a wet vac,My cat inhales this food. he absolutely loves it.  In addition. because he licks the bowl clean there is never any bits of food left that has to be scraped off the plate.  Also. since it smells like canned chicken it does not give him funky cat food breath and mi gato is a face licker so this is a plus.  Only downfall is cost. at his weight he would need four cans a day which is quite expensive so I feed him a mix of no grain dried food and the Weruva canned.

So. in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online. and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand.

If you put them in a bowl. add milk or rice milk to soften a bit. then add your cereal. nuts. whatever. you make a really great breakfast with a fruit flavor. no matter what the season. This particular brand is the only organic one where the berries are grown & processed in the U.S. I get them on Amazon's auto-ship plan. which brings the price down quite a bit. making it far lower than getting an equivalent in a market - which frankly. you can't. because even organic stores don't usually list where their freeze-dried berries are grown.

54715,B001UOJGNM,A1SXUCZYHQVMY,MWhit,1/1,1281052800,Pretty good,My bottle arrived early and I was very excited to have found a good moisturizer. My bottle says organic coconut oil. buy it's advertised as 'virgin' coconut oil. I tried doing a little research. and couldn't tell if there is a difference between virgin coconut oil and organic coconut oil. The oil does keep my skin hydrated. but it is greasy and I use it in small amounts. I mix a small amount with my regular lotion so it will absorb in my skin better. If I don't mix it. it takes a long time for my skin to absorb the oil. I'm guessing this will be perfect for the winter. so I'm looking forward to using it then. I read that coconut oil is supposed to help with eczema. but it doesn't do a lot for mine. It does help with the itching (I can go 5-8 hours without itching). but the rash hasn't gone away. I had better results from a natural oil mixture that I buy at the drug store. I don't like that I have to mix the oil with my regular lotion (I was hoping to replace my lotion altogether). but it keeps my skin hydrated better than my lotion alone or other products I've used alone. I'd recommend this product. I look forward to using it in the winter.

It is absolutely divine on steaks or sprinkled over edamame.  But I have to confess. sometimes I just take off the top every now and then to get a whiff.  Heaven!
54728,B001P247YC,A2GCVCOQXGL8YA,Savvy Skeptic,1/1,1302307200,More Salt than Smoke,Came in 3 nice-sized shakers. sealed.  Has a very strong scent of woodsmoke when opened. which gives a great smoky aroma to foods. however I don't find it to impart much smoke flavor.  But aroma can deceive the palate. so the heavy scent may be all some people need or want for that hint of smoke in their dishes.  It does not give off any of that chemical-fake aftertaste or oddness that comes from imitation/liquid smoke flavorings. which is also nice.  It is easy to over-salt with this. and after a few mishaps. I found that I need to use 2-3 shakes less what looks/feels right.  Overall. it makes a nice alternative to plain sea salt for added aroma.
54729,B001P247YC,A3GF88HH0TND83,vbautry,1/1,1282262400,Awesome!,This smoked salt is amazing.  It gives food such a great taste.  Highly recommend.

I have used it to cook with. to help a small fungal issue on my feet. dry skin. my own hair... My only concern is the bottle expires 15 months from the date of manufacturer date. so this bottle is good for another month.<br />I'm glad it was  a small bottle.

It (coconut oil. in general) doesn't do much in the way of moisture for my hair. but it's a great sealant. It also moisturizes better when combined with other oils. I loved this particular brand over the other one because it smells so delicious. I used it on my hair. skin. and lips when I ran out of chapstick.<br />The only downside to my purchase was that the seam at the bottom of the bottle burst when the coconut oil hardened from the cold. That wasn't a huge issue. though. I just ran the bottle upside down under some warm water and moved the liquid coconut oil to another container.

My family likes it when prepared like this:<br /><br />melt 2-3 Tbs butter in a small saucepan and whisk in 1/4 C mix for about 30 seconds over low to med low heat.<br />add 1 C milk (we use 2%. but any works fine) and whisk constantly - or at least every few minutes- till thickened.<br />I squeeze half a fresh lemon into the sauce just before serving.<br /><br />You can easily adjust the measurements to make the sauce as thick/strong/buttery as you like. just as you would when making home-made hollandaise.<br />This is easier than making easy hollandaise by streaming hot clarified butter into a blender with egg yolks.... because I don't have to clean the blender afterwards- just my little <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CM69>Cuisinart 719-16 Chef's Classic Stainless 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Cover</a><br /><br />Super easy 5 min sauce that is easy to keep in the pantry.<br /><br />No need for 2 huge containers? share it :)
54819,B001HTRDVC,A26UT4F4J7DELI,Melinda,7/7,1300838400,Great for kids with dairy/soy sensitivities,My 2.5 year old has been drinking this milk since he turned a year old.  It has been a great alternative to cow's milk and soymilk. It is fortified with vitamins and minerals. and it has a TON of omega 3s. 6s. and 9s!  I like that this milk has a bit of healthy fat in it. since that's good for growing children.  I am aware of the sugar in this product. but per 1 cup it has 9g of sugar whereas regular whole cow's milk has about 13g per cup.  The flavor is a bit earthy and strong for me; it's difficult for me to enjoy even though I do drink other grain milks (rice. soy. oat. etc) without a problem.  However. my son is used to it and drinks it just the same as other toddlers his age drink cow's milk.  I have tried the unsweetened. unflavored. and chocolate versions. but my son didn't like those. Our pediatrician recommended this milk alternative. and she said it was fine to give him the flavored/sweetened stuff.  The consistency is thicker than rice milk (the most common alternative for children who can't drink cow's milk or soymilk). so it works well when I'm cooking/baking.  When my infant baby girl turns 1. we will most definitely be giving her this milk product as well.<br /><br />I really can't say enough good stuff about this product.  I highly recommend it.
54825,B001HTRDVC,A2CARJ1YP9I263,autumnrose,0/0,1335484800,My son loves it!,My 1 1/2 year old has a milk allergy and soy sensitivity so this is what he drinks. He loves it. i sweeten it up a little with coconut oil though :]<br />It's expensive. yes...it runs us nearly 5 dollars a day. but it's worth it!
54832,B0012KB4GG,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,c2,0/0,1249516800,Not his favorite.....,I'm not sure why my guy doesn't like these sliced varieties for the most part. he loves them in the Friskies general line. but not these.  This one also has liver in it which may be why - he absolutely hates liver.  I recommend these for their great nutritional value but again. mine didn't care for the taste at all.  I've tried it on him more than once since he loves beef in general (loves it raw too!). so this one is a total mystery to me.  Recommend but with the above experience.
54840,B002UKRORU,AC4R1GZE6JYTN,Coco Chanel dakko,3/3,1293753600,Great Mix!,I initially used the mix from Williams Sonoma which was good but pricey.  Decided to give this one a try and it's great!  Nice and light batter that works great with fillings.  I have given it as Christmas gifts and will definitely be ordering again.  Too bad it's not part of Amazon's free shipping though.

We taught him to sit in one day with these. we broke them in half. and he thinks they are great.  We had success so I passed a box on to two of my friends who just got puppies. they love them too...I told them to go to Amazon for the best deal.  They always have what I want at a great price and delivery is quick.
54870,B00376T0JG,A1YLNNUFUL2SD8,Red,0/0,1345248000,Good brand of cookies.,My senior German Shephard likes the Blue Dog Bakery peanut butter and molasses cookies a lot more than these. It's weird she would only take it if she saw me take a bite. Even then she took it and dropped it on her bed and never ate it. Never had to do that with the peanut butter cookies. They are small cookies. Good for small and big dogs.  Nice deal. won't stop me from buying her other flavors from this company but both my dog and I are very disappointed with these.

At the first bite she said These are the best gluten free cookies EVER!  Of course. I had to try one and they are Wonderful!  She has been gluten-free for almost a year and we have tried many gluten-free cookies.  Most are chalky and taste pretty bad.  This one was soft. flavorful and wonderful.  It rivaled any home-made non-gluten-free snickerdoodle I have ever had.  Thanks WOW!

54966,B000IHJEDE,A2AS281JRDBLTQ,Daniel,1/2,1343952000,Pretty good,I've tried the Grilled Cheese flavor so far. and am quite happy with it. A great Keto or Low-Carb snack. I don't feel that these are very salty. but it may just be the particular flavor. For those people who are deathly afraid of salt. please do a bit of research and realize that sodium intake does not meaningfully affect blood pressure.

I like to have it with a glass of wine at the end of the day.<br /><br />Will be trying the butter flavor popped cheese next time I place an order.
54992,B000IHJEDE,A3E7NP2H0RMUVR,Diane Perrault Musician for the times,4/4,1259884800,Cheese - with c crunch!,This was a surprising product.  It has the look of little 'chips' of some type. But pop one in you mouth and start chewing. and a rich. wonderful cheese flavor fills you mouth.  If you love cheese. this convenient little package of goodness is for you!  The package is quite small and there is not a lot of product inside but it is just the right amount to satisfy a craving for a real cheese snack.
55036,B000IHJEDE,A3M9JURZRU17KD,JudyC,1/1,1259884800,just ok,I had high hopes for these. I mean. crunchy cheese. what's not to love?  But they have more of a processed taste than I would have liked.  I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag.  I gave them a fair chance. kept an open mind. but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to.  The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese.  Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase. I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors.  Oh well. it was worth a try.
55041,B000IHJEDE,A3U5EMSDYKI06T,Carl Cravens,1/1,1178496000,Salty and a tad boring,I like the single-serving bags. and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought. but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.<br /><br />They are crunchy. and have a decent texture. but they're saltier than I'd prefer.  They're what I reach for when I want something salty. or when I'm just bored with the rest of the snacks on hand.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can tell a difference between the Nacho flavor rounds and the plain ones.
55055,B000IHJEDE,A2VTN9NDZUASCI,xyppy,0/0,1347926400,Extremely salty,Definitely won't buy these again.  Very. very salty.  Too bad because the idea is great.  I was eager for a low carb snack but this isn't it.

Our porridge is so flavorful and hearty that I feel like it's the good mood breakfast.  Of course my favorite way is with butter and brown sugar. but a spoon full of blackberry preserves or a handful of Craisins and we're into a whole new experience.  Enjoy.
55096,B0039QW2EE,A273Q1O73NER22,T. Trude tltrude,3/3,1327276800,Nasty after taste!,It would probable be good in chili. but it sucks mixed with instant rice.  There was a bitter after taste that lasted long after the meal. as well.  I'll try pre-washing the dust off. and rehydrating in a seperate pot. next time.  Part of the problem might be that the pepers were not cooked before dehydration.
55117,B001GVIUXQ,A360EFJOE4L7IZ,Persistent Patricia,70/70,1211414400,Good for cats - Loved by cats,Approximately 20 years ago. I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet.  Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives. Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet. because the other brands caused FUS. caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year. one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward. the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company. including premium foods like IAMS and Science. were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands. as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source. I finally found a few. including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS. as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall. the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food.
55121,B001GVIUXQ,A15ASTBZBU7AXD,KD Allen me,6/6,1280016000,Great for cats with corn allergies--meat 1 ingredient,I have 2 cats.  One is fluffy and finicky and won't eat anything but wet food and human meat.  The other one is athletic. lively and will eat only dried crap food.<br /><br />Well. the athletic one started having terrible eye problems (red and weepy) and she constantly scratched at them.  We tried oral Lysine. Terramycin antibiotics. and swapping out the plastic dish for ceramic.  Still she had eye problems.  So. guessing it might be a food allergy. I bought her Newman's because it doesn't have corn gluten. the primary ingredient of almost all dry cat foods. Newman's 1 and 2 ingredients are MEAT.<br /><br />She ate it immediately. Within 2 days her eye problems disappeared. so I am assuming she had developed allergies to the corn product in the dry food (and by the way. what felines eat corn in the wild?).<br /><br />But what really amazed me is that fluffy and finicky passed over her usual wet food and went right for the dry Newman's.  I just about wet my knickers!<br /><br />There you have it. 5 stars.
55130,B001GVIUXQ,A35DF1BK7YU58C,consumer X,4/4,1213228800,Fine food...,Newmans cat foods are among the finest and tastiest (according to my four furry friends) canned food available.  Haven't found any of the varieties which they didn't thoroughly enjoy and finish every morsel.  Thanks Paul !!!
55142,B001GVIUXQ,AW68CSRWAL4FJ,Helena-Sophia Exel The Better It Gets - The ...,1/1,1319414400,The Best Cat Food Ever,Before I started using 'Newman's Own Organics Adult Cat Formula' my Cats were already on a considerably supreme diet - 'Blue Buffalo Grain Free Wilderness Cat Formula'.<br />The sad story behind this change from expensive to luxury cat food is the wet dermatitis my youngest boy had for a while now. Even with Blue Buffalo food. As soon as I had switched to 'Newman's Organic' the fur licking receded and has basically stopped after feeding it for four weeks.<br />Every Cat Owner knows about how delicate and picky Cats can be when it comes to food. My Kitties love Newman's Own and they are all very beautiful and/or handsome.
55146,B001GVIUXQ,A2NH4AW5JQHORN,Jennifer Beall,1/1,1295827200,Saved a lot of $$$ at the vet--be patient. though. it might take some time!,I bought this food based upon other reviews from people who said that it helped their cats who had been licking off their fur. For a long time our cat had been licking the fur off of her back legs. The vet said it was possibly an allergy and that we could spend all the money for allergy testing but might not find anything. She also said that we could consider giving the cat Benadryl to see if that helped (but didn't necessarily see the need to do either at that point).<br /><br />Eventually. though. the cat got to the point where she was pretty much licking off all of the fur she could reach--we literally had a half naked cat! She also had lots of small scabs (which she'd gotten before. but not to this extent). which was probably at least partly why she was licking the fur off. We figured the vet. if she saw the cat at that point. would recommend allergy testing. I decided to give this food a try first.<br /><br />I'm very happy to report that it worked! Some other reviewers said that it worked for their cats in a couple of weeks. With our cat it took at least 4-6 weeks. At this point she's grown all of her fur back and the scabs are gone. too.<br /><br />And she has loved the food from the very beginning--no problems eating it (as at least one reviewer mentioned). even though it is in very small pieces.<br /><br />So if your cat is licking off his or her fur. consider trying this before spending all of the money for allergy testing (unless. of course. your cat is having other medical issues. too. that you're worried about). Great stuff!

55156,B001GVIUXQ,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,Peggy pab920,1/1,1246060800,3 out of 5 liked it,The 2 cats that didn't like it are older and I think it is because the smaller round shape is harder to hold in their mouths to chew as a piece would drop out of their mouth and they wouldn't try to retrieve it. The other 3 eat it fine without hesitation. When it goes on sale again I will purchase it again. One improvement to the bag would be for it to self seal like so many other products are now doing.

He is not a picky eater either (he was adopted at 5 and his previous family fed him some grocery store brands).  He eats around it and would rather sit at the pantry door meowing for new food then to go eat a full bowl of this.  The feral cats outside won't eat it either!  The only ones who seem to like it are the raccoons and possums and I try to not feed them.  We give this a two. two thumbs down.

55261,B004650TGU,A1PJX7Y2V3SICE,AndreaF,0/0,1343001600,Good Kona coffee blend,We really like Tully's Kona Blend in the K-Cups!  It's hard to find inexpensive 100% Kona coffee anywhere. so I usually order the K-Cup blends that are available either on Amazon. or at our local commissary. because I really love the unique flavor and aroma of Kona.<br /><br />I think that Tully's is a quality brand of coffee in general. but the Kona is my favorite.  It's delicious: rich. smooth. nutty. the flavor and aroma make a great start to my day.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
55284,B008Z4VAPM,A2A46BUQRGSAB0,Sliver,17/18,1134518400,Once acquired...This (satisfying!) miso soup might be your new addiction.,I first picked this off the shelf at a military commissary in Kansas one summer... and I never stopped. The first time you try this stuff. it's like wine or avocados; it's a taste that is certainly acquired. and like nothing else. I have fed it to a friend and to my significant other; few like it the first time. but you find yourself strangely coming back for more until it's a staple in your house. like it is in mine. Kind of reminds me of sushi; first time I tried it. I was like. this is odd. why do people eat this?. then. I found myself craving it a week later. Haha. Now I love sushi and miso! (By the way. it comes in an envelope with 3 individual packets). Mix it in hot water. to taste. You might like it with more or less water. depending on how salty you like your food. -Experiment with it to your satisfaction. and I guarantee. there is much of that to be had.<br /><br />I usually add all 3 little individual packets (it's low-fat) to a decent-sized cup of hot water. add my favorite vinegar. and let it sit and cure for a minute or so. since the little green sea-vegetable flakes (and green onions + tofu squares) need time to rehydrate and turn a little chewy and palatable. I then sip it and fish the sea vegetables out to my heart's content.<br /><br />(I also hear that miso can be generally healthy for you!)<br /><br />If you let it sit. the miso will start to separate from the rest of the soup and you have delightful little clouds of miso particles floating in your bowl. which is sort of entertaining and visually delightful. too. I think of it as cheap. delicious entertainment. But then again. I am easily amused. ;)
55286,B008Z4VAPM,A15GX698WYMWP0,Carolyn Goldfarb,7/8,1128297600,A good soup with a unique taste,Personally. I'd love a bowl of miso soup any day. I first tried it in a very nice sushi restaurant. and then again in a less-fancy one. A few months later. I discovered that Price Chopper sells these exact packets (they're a bit more expensive there than here on Amazon).<br /><br />Miso soup is hard to describe. I think of it as having a taste that you kind of have to acquire...It took me a few bowls to really get used to it. But once you do. it's great! I suggest this for anyone who's interested in Japanese culture and food.
55303,B008Z4VAPM,A2TFM1EZG16PRI,Woodie,0/7,1276560000,Don't waste your money.,I trusted the other good reviews. but this tastes awful and has a bad aftertaste.  Yuk.

We fell in love with the kuerig in our sunday school class simply for its convenience unfortunately though I honestly am a major coffee lover and somewhat of a coffee snob so when we traded our aeropress (which I recommend 100%. I just want something faster these days)I had a hard time finding a k-cup that was bold enough for me-if you like dark french roasts. you know what Im talking about. well to this day. Ive tried many different k-cups. I even have the eco cup where you can put your own coffee in and nothing matches tulleys french roast...the only one that I would drink besides it is jet fuel but its def still not numero uno like tulleys!
55339,B006VRTR0K,A2QKQ34YSBEQFO,Allen,0/0,1350086400,Good French Roast,Tully's French Roast is a solid choice and one of my staples.  This is my favorite French Roast currently available in a K-cup.  Maybe someday Peets will come in a K-cup. sigh.  One trick if you find it isn't as rich as you normally get in your favorite bistro. is to make a smaller size portion.
55343,B006VRTR0K,APVTYBBSEZMH9,Marcia L. Royce MLR,0/0,1349654400,awesome tasting!,Best tasting coffee. Love dark roast with a bit of a bite. Can't go wrong with Tullys. Well worth the money.
55347,B006VRTR0K,A3EKFXA6827YAM,Dallas,0/0,1347926400,k-cups,Great coffee. I love this k-cup flavor. Delicious full bodied coffee for bold coffee lovers. doesn't disappoint. I always buy in bulk. because the price per cup decreases. but also because I KNOW I'm going to drink a lot. Love this coffee!

Tully's French Roast is at the top of the list with my K-cup brewer.  The coffee is delicious. great dark roast taste. and I do look forward to each morning great cup of coffee....Each night before I go to bed I am excited to get up the next morning to my great cup of coffee.....

55367,B004QXH5AA,A31LEVBRCI0BQX,gamerette86,0/0,1343347200,Tasty!!,Realllllly good!. I saw this reviewed on Seattle Coffee Gear's site and being me I thought oo I wonder if its on amazon! sure enough.. They had the whole bean version which I wanted more but but no grinder yet so I bought drip and since I hadn't tried it before I was wondering if it was really good or if it was just meh. This is awesome coffee. the drip grind is really great too and strong! I learned quick that you do not want to use too much now if your big on strong coffee go nuts. I used a cone type filter and used 2 1/2 tablespoons and I didn't really level off much and it was sooo strong but not bitter it was super smooth and it was chocolaty really good. love this coffee plan on buying more :0) if you can't find it on here just go to their website.

55402,B002ZF06JI,A21U85NRKKYD1R,Jennifer Nardin,0/0,1349913600,great value & dogs love them!,we have 3 dogs of various size (15 lbs. 50lbs. 80lbs) and they all liked different kinds of rawhide-chews until we got this bag... all 3 dogs love these!! It seems that they satisfy the desire to chew on something substantial. but are still soft enough that they are enjoyable the entire time (pressed rawhides can be too hard. rope/fabric toys are WAY to soft.)  great product when balanced with this price! In fact. I'm here writing a review because I'm ordering another bag... :)
55405,B002ZF06JI,A38JPH88CLJ66Q,Momofda4leggedkind,0/0,1344902400,BIG BAG BONUS,I love this product b/c you really get more than what you pay for.  The chewies are different sizes in the bag so my babies can pick what they want.  With 3 big dogs. I went through them alot.  It seems that this bag is so big that they last a little longer.  The best part is they are always available and super fast delivery!  Wal@$t were always out and it would take up to 3 months before they may get 5 bags.  Dogs with chewie withdraws IS NOT fun.
55415,B002ZF06JI,A3IL83SP27PMIN,4RK9Z,0/0,1331942400,DOG CHEWS GREAT,MY TWO LARGE DOGS JUST LOVE THESE CHEWS.  THEY ARE LONG SO THEY CAN HOLD THEM WITH THERE FRONT PAWS AND CHEW AWAY.  THEY ARE A GREAT VALUE AT ABOUT $5 PER POUND IN A FIVE POUND SACK WITH FREE SHIPPING.  I WILL ORDER THESE AGAIN.  SOME DOG CHEWS CAN UPSET MY DOG'S STOMACH...AS THE ONE HAS IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME.  BUT THESE ARE OKAY.
55417,B002ZF06JI,A2JS17O8XB2AWT,Rosebud Livin' La Vida Loca,0/0,1330300800,Nice size,After reading other reviews. I decided to try these. Many of the chews are too big for my 40lb Schnauzers. but a jigsaw took care of that; we cut most of the chews in half.<br /><br />We had been using another brand but over time. the chews were getting smaller and smaller so we had to throw out about 20% of the package.<br /><br />All in all. these work well and the dogs like them. We can also report no stomach problems whatsoever.
55435,B002ZF06JI,A1T95OUOX0T7V4,garp,2/4,1315180800,How disappointing...,I've bought this item several times before. but now...<br />Less than 1 year ago. this was $6 bucks cheaper. got delivered quickly. and my dogs loved 'em.<br />Now. these are more expensive than steak. take 10 days to get here. and the new strips look more like bleached cardboard than rawhide. and my dogs suggest I not waste my $$ on these again.<br />Oh well. that's progress.
55436,B002ZF06JI,A1HVC9EJ9KSU51,Fred Schillinger,0/1,1345939200,ROTTEN CHEWS.,I would give this negative stars.  Used to get these on auto delivery and dog loved them.  Haven't bought in a while so when they arrived I was surprized to discover a WARM bag with discolored chews (light brown).  Opened the bag and was almost knocked down by a STRONG methane/urine smell. DISGUSTING! Didn't even bother returning.  Threw them out immediately.  Good-bye $26 bucks.
55440,B000LRH61I,A3C35U3ZE70XPA,Dawson Nash,12/12,1182902400,Schweppes Original Bitter Lemon,This product is very difficult to find. and it is a far superior bitter lemon than Canada Dry's. It has bits of lemon in the drink and is the perfect summertime mixer with gin. vodka. and especially rum.
55454,B004V8OYAO,A2FDCD6PGCHZQ5,bookwoman,1/1,1327104000,Delicious and Not Pricey.,I had never tried them before. but they are sure delicious. I couldn't resist trying another pop-tart for such a low price. None of mine broke from the packaging but then again it wasn't shipped overseas. Definitely a good buy.
55456,B004V8OYAO,A2UT7Y18H32YWO,Mr. Frugal,0/0,1346112000,Grape Pop Tarts,This product is good. It's not my favorite flavor but for those of you who love grape will enjoy this. I can't take away any stars for the product because it was fine. fresh. and good. Just not my favorite. I'll stick with the Wild Delicious Strawberry which is awesome.<br /><br />P.S. I usually eat my tarts cold but this one worked better for me after 10 seconds (for two) in a microwave. Enjoy!
55458,B004V8OYAO,A1DYK5WFBB4CFG,R. Lee,0/0,1344902400,weird flavor,I personally didn't like the flavor. It tasted okay when you actually toast them. but raw it was an odd experience.
55460,B000EGUYOM,A1E7BYP6JGDUHD,Anonymous,10/11,1155513600,not as good as the almond crunch,For me. at least. the almond crunch by Mrs. Mays is perfection in a snack. so it is hard to beat.  The pumpkin crunch seemed to have a little bit of a smokey flavor when you first bite in. which was surprising to me (though I have not really had many pumpkin seeds as a snack before). and I was expecting a bit more sweetness to it. similar to the almond crunch.  Overall. this is a great snack. and very addictive once you start munching!  You can tell that Mrs. Mays uses high quality ingredients in their snack foods. making for a great. healthy. tasty snack!
55461,B000EGUYOM,A2POU2NI9UJJPW,NM in SoCal,12/16,1226361600,Delicious. healthy...Product of China?!,This product is portrayed as healthy and natural. but I was shocked and dismayed to see that it's shipped from halfway across the world. I understand buying electronics. shoes. etc. from China. but my FOOD? I doubt the safety of this food product. and don't see how they can guarantee that  it's vegan. non-GMO. dairy free. wheat-free. gluten-free. etc. Plus I don't see the point in purchasing something that has obviously left such a hefty carbon footprint. But beyond that. how hard is it to make a delicious snack like this in the USA. from USA-grown ingredients? Seriously?
55464,B000EGUYOM,AWVFB7M6ICGZI,S. Omeone newsiereader,0/0,1241049600,Our favorite flavor!,We like pretty much all of the Mrs. May's snacks. esp. being a gluten-free family. but this is definitely the favorite of all four in our family (the children being ages almost 3 and 6). The cranberry blueberry and almond are close. but this is the best!
55475,B004F9QADS,AOWRNKHG5PPMP,M. Mandry MC,0/0,1326240000,Poorly shipped,The adapter was missing and one of the holders to the pot was missing and the package was ripped and poorly packaged and shipped. I returned it and was refunded.
55477,B000CQP836,A2RTM7869LI3EE,Julie,9/10,1181001600,Not in any way gourmet or worth the price,The chocolates were melting when they arrived. but that was the least of the problems.  There was nothing gourmet about the small box of chocolates we received.  I'd suggest finding a better chocolate of the month club because there must be reasonable alternatives.
55480,B0012JS7H6,A2D2FF9R76P647,Joan Zabelka bookz,0/0,1261958400,My favorite,Excellent cinnamon flavor. It keeps me going all year long especially when Starbucks runs out of my pumpkin spice. It is my favorite flavor and brand. I did have to order it<br />on-line because I only found it once at a store. It's a seasonal type of an item so on-line works best.
55484,B0002M7WG6,A30VK45ATDZB38,Lulabelle,1/1,1273190400,Loved for 5 Years,Only one of our three dogs learned to use the machine. which is fine. because she's the one we bought it for!  It took her no time to learn to use it.  She looks like a little factory worker pushing the lever up and down.  We've had it for five years. but my son accidentally stepped on it  tonight  and broke the plastic  dome.  This is an excellent product that has withstood a lot of rough use (up until now).  We have to order another one immediately so Katie will still have her own private cache of food!
55489,B0002M7WG6,A3047J5G2P2VSW,tent pole,0/0,1333497600,key parts are cheap plastic,Yes. the dog loves it...loves it to death! When the gumball machine is broken and you're back to using the tippy Kong. you discover that you can buy another plastic part for the gumball machine. but do you? Only if you want to reward cheap shortcuts by the supplier.

55505,B004CYLW7A,A18LBGL7L9FEZV,Larry,0/0,1297036800,I love the new Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cereal,This new cereal from Kellogg's is another winner. in my opinion.<br />Kellogg's cereals has been a staple in our household for generations. This new cereal is a worthy addition to their lineup.<br />It's made from corn and oats in the familiar O shape. The O's are topped with roasted peanuts an lightly sweetened with honey.<br />In milk the cereal stays crunchy and is quite tasty. The sweet taste is just enough for me. not overly sweet.<br />It is good for you with 2 grams of fiber and protein and vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I've tried the flakes<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IOVWN8>Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut 14.1 oz</a> and those are good too.
55519,B004CYLW7A,A1SCANWWQTEG9I,TheLastCoyote,0/0,1296777600,Pretty good,This is not the kind of cereal that would ever be a staple in our house but the kids liked it well enough. The texture is good and doesn't get slimy like Cheerios does after sitting in the milk for a bit. Kind of an airy. crunchy puff. It was sweet enough that the kids enjoyed it without pouring on extra sugar but not so sweet that I couldn't sit down and eat a bowl myself. I would definitely consider buying it on occasion in the future.
55526,B004CYLW7A,A1LAGS8H4A2DR7,Bill Nicholas,0/0,1296691200,Grows on you,My 8 and 9 year old kids uprated this cereal from a 3 to a 4 after the second day of eating it. Originally. my son said it tasted good but didn't have that pop of excitement he got from some other cereals (I don't know where he got that phrase). My daughter pointed out that it tasted somewhat like Captain Crunch. due to the fact the Crunchy Nut Os are coated with the same kind of crunchy coating. The second day of eating them. my son couldn't get enough. saying he was addicted to them. The fact the kids like them is great. Myself. I wasn't so excited. They seem like the kind of cereal I have seen before. They aren't bad; I can taste the nuts and honey. but I don't think I'd eat them on my own. One thing to note is that the crunch is not produced by the nuts but by the coated Os.
55539,B004CYLW7A,A29TDHNT47LR05,L. King lucyferking,0/0,1296259200,Tastes great. average nutrition. very expensive,Don't get me wrong. this cereal tastes delicious.  It has a nice crunchy texture. good nutty flavor. and a sweet glaze.  If you buy cereal just for the taste. this is like gourmet Honey Nut Cheerios.  Very delicious.<br /><br />That said. it is not as vitamin enriched as some other cereals that have similar amounts of sugar. so the trade-off for the sugar is not as good.  Crunchy Nut has 10 grams of sugar per 3/4 cup serving.  Malt O Meal Honey Nut Scooters has 10 grams per 1 cup serving--totally comparable.  But Scooters has more calcium. and zinc. and twice the iron and folic acid.<br /><br />Also. Crunchy Nut costs about 3 times as much as Scooters.<br /><br />My advice:  If taste is king over any other consideration. buy this cereal.  If not. there are other more nutritious. economical options.
55542,B004CYLW7A,A2MG95DI29NJTJ,Seth Eliot,0/0,1296172800,Solidly mediocre,This product was not bad. but was disappointing.  The box promises roasted nut and honey.  While I could detect the honey flavor. rendered as a glaze more reminiscent of sugar than honey. there is little to no nut flavor.  In deed the product image shows each O covered in nuts and promises. nuts in every bite. the actual appearance is much different with no visible nuts on the cereal.<br /><br />The texture is fine.  The crunch holds up in milk.  It is more of an airy texture than say a dense Cheerio.  More the texture of Honeycomb brand cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally this product is mediocre.  Again not bad. but could be better.  Sugars rack in at 10g. less than many sugar sweetened cereal but still high.  Fiber is 2g which is something. but a bit low.  1g of fat is gaood and none of it saturated or trans fat.<br /><br />I will finish the box. but will not by more of these again.
55556,B004CYLW7A,A2DG63DN704LOI,Eric Slay,0/0,1296086400,Delicious!,I thought Crunchy Nut would be similar to Honey Nut Cheerios but I was mistaken. While Honey Nut Cheerios is dense and almost powdery when chewed. crunch nut is more crunchy and crispy. I am a fan of both. but I believe that the flavor of Crunchy Nut is better. The O's have tiny peanut pieces on them and then are covered with honey to give them a great taste and a better texture than Honey Nut Cheerios.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
55564,B004CYLW7A,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,R. OSullivan,0/0,1296000000,These Are Crunchy. Nutty and Very Sweet,These O's are just as the name describes. They are crunchy with peanut pieces in the actual O's and they are very sweet.  But the calorie count is reasonable (100 calories for 3/4 cup). and I like eating a handful or two as a midday snack or instead of a dessert. Given the peanuts. I'm surprised how little protein the cereal contains and wouldn't really make this my regular morning cereal.
55574,B004CYLW7A,A3MLKJ1HHA2SX0,Robert L. Stinnett,0/0,1295913600,Honey Nut Cheerios Want-to-Be,I had high hopes for this cereal. as I am a big peanut fan.  However. while the cereal itself is not bad it's lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First and foremost it's not made with whole grains like Honey Nut Cheerios is.  Another reviewer put it nicely when they said this is equivalent to eating candy for breakfast.  The amount of sugar and refined carbohydrates is way too much for any type of health benefit whatsoever.  The peanuts are so small and in such small pieces (more like granules) that I don't consider them anywhere near enough to consider any health benefits from the nuts.<br /><br />The taste itself is good. and it's a bit softer of a crunch than most cereals. but outside of that it's just too many carbohydrates to be on the breakfast table.  Kellog's could really improve this cereal by getting rid of some of the added sweetners and switch to a whole grain recipe.  Until then. if you like sweet cereals with little health benefits then this is for you -- but otherwise. stick with Honey Nut Cheerios.
55580,B004CYLW7A,AM2IR1V5EU55U,Brian J. Greene djbrian,1/2,1302480000,No Good,If you're going to get a sugar cereal it ought to at least taste great. so you're getting some pleasure in exchange for the unhealthiness. But this cereal doesn't taste very good. Can't see any reason to recommend it.
55588,B004CYLW7A,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b DR SHOCK,2/2,1297900800,TASTY. BUT NOTHING NEW!,I enjoy cereal and this cereal is like most sugar coated grains of goodness. It's not going to win any points for originality. but it is a tasty little treat. It's like Cheerios with some added sugar and nut fragments sprinkled on top. I've seen this cereal much cheaper at Wal-Mart than the prices on line. so if you're looking to give it a try. buy it there.
55592,B004CYLW7A,A26R7LLAFTPC3U,William Hardin,1/1,1303344000,Much better than expected!,Kellogg's Crunchy Nut: Roasted Nut & Honey<br /><br />Much better than expected!  I generally don't gravitate towards the 'O' shaped cereals. my favorite cereal is Honey Bunches of Oats.  That being said. when I saw this Nut & Honey cereal. I figured I'd give it a try.  It's tastier than I imagined. it has a stronger honey flavor than most honey-flavored cereals do.  The 'enlarged' picture of the cereal on the box makes it look like there's more nut 'shavings' than there really are. but that being said. there's enough nut there to make a difference and have the cereal taste slightly nutty. which is a good thing in my opinion.  ...I'm not one to eat (or snack on) dry cereal. but this one makes the cut. it's currently sitting next to me on the desk.
55597,B004CYLW7A,AGHIUO1B3IF8H,Amy Phipps,0/1,1306108800,I couldn't even finish the box...,I love cereal and eat it for breakfast almost every day. I've tried just about everything in the breakfast aisle. but I've never found anything to rival my two stand-by favorites. plain yellow-box Cheerios and Honey Bunches of Oats. I figured these Kellogg's Crunchy Nut O's were worth a shot. however. as they had both honey and peanuts going for them.<br /><br />Boy. was I disappointed. I thought this cereal was much. much too sweet. and felt that it left a bad corn aftertaste in my mouth. My husband. a huge fan of Honey Nut Cheerios. didn't like this either. After a few bowls. the box sat untouched in my cupboard for months until I finally threw it out. Definitely not for us!
55600,B004CYLW7A,AGXV8E7XK9J6H,Brian Koch Aspiring Photographer,0/1,1298764800,OK. but kinda bland,I like the texture of this cereal. and I'm a big fan of peanuts. but this just seems a little bland to me.  It's not a bad taste. just not really very strong to me. so it's kinda like eating semi-sweet slightly flavored little crunchy pieces of cardboard or something.  If it had a stronger flavor or maybe another flavor in addition to what it has I think I would enjoy it more.
55602,B004CYLW7A,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,Adam,0/1,1297900800,Basically a honey nut cheerios rip-off. but good,This cereal is good. if unoriginal.  My four factor review is below:<br /><br />Crunch: 4/5<br />Flavour: 4/5<br />Nutrition: 4/5<br />Value: 4/5
55612,B004CYLW7A,AQ3IN3MRXQ5KH,IlPrimitivo,0/1,1296259200,Light and Tasty,Not a regular cereal eater but I found this to be a tasty treat.  Sweet. nutty. and a little bit salty which is a great combination.<br /><br />The 11 oz box of cereal did not last long at all.
55657,B004CYLW7A,AE61FFT0GUD2G,Frederick S. Goethel wildcatcreekbooks,0/0,1299456000,Not Something I Would Spend Money On,I like the version of this cereal that is made by the competitor of this cereal and eat it periodically. I tried this hoping to find a very similar product that I could buy on sale if the other wasn't. The other option was a cereal that was so different that it would  become a new option for me.<br /><br />The taste was adequate. The nuts were almost nonexistent....at least to the naked eye. They may have been rolled in dust. but there were definitely no pieces on the side of the cereal.<br /><br />The color of the cereal was awful. reminding me of the color of what babies leave in a used diaper. It was not at all appealing. In addition. there is a lot of sugar in this cereal.<br /><br />For the above reasons. I wouldn't bother to buy this in the future.
55658,B004CYLW7A,A3U0S17XYK8XMJ,Alexander Lucard,0/0,1299283200,My Rabbits Loved It. Me...Not So Much,First of all. i was really happy to see that this new Kellog's cereal was all natural. I try to stay away from cereals that are more chemical compounds than foodstuffs I can actually recognize. So i was happy to give this cereal a try.<br /><br />I didn't hate it. but I didn't like it either. It had a burned popcorn aftertaste that I really didn't care for. but the actual cereal itself wasn't too bad. It was something to take a bite of here or there as a dry snack. It didn't seem to work too well with milk.<br /><br />That being said. my rabbits were willing to kill for a bite of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey as if they were crack addicts looking for a fix. At one point. one of them snuck into the kitchen. jumped up on the counter. pushed the box off. jumped down onto the box and then began dragging it to her cage. Something about the smell of the cereal just drove them into voracious eating. Maybe Kellog would do better selling this as a pet food treat rather than a human one.
55666,B004CYLW7A,A2F1P10GGZ7K2T,Erik1988,0/0,1298505600,another sweet. non-nutrious cereal to add to the list,First off I think the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28>Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut. 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> taste better than this version. but I had to try it.<br /><br />Also. the cereal stays crunch for a bit in milk. but that is because it seems like a big bit of honey coated batter. Not much nutty crunch. more like a cracker crunch to it.<br /><br />Ingredients: Yellow corn meal. sugar. corn bran. peanuts. honey. molasses. salt. whole oat flour. caramel color. baking soda. annatto extract color. ascorbic acid (vitamin C).niacinamide. reduced iron. zinc oxide. pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6). riboflavin (Vitamin B2). Thiamin Hydrochloride (Vitamine B1). vitamine A. Palmitate. BHT (preservative). Folic acid. Vitamin D. Wheat starch. Vitamin B12.<br /><br />Well? Ehh. Some of the cheapest ingredients (i.e. corn) so don't expect much here. Just surprised that with the heal conscious movement that a more healthy option isn't being made here.<br /><br />It's a nice crunchy snack you could eat straight form the box without milk. like fiddle-faddle or something.<br /><br />I ate a two servings an hour before a bike ride. Went out for a ride and 30minutes into ride I had no energy left. I wasn't surprised as this is just an empty sugary cereal.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy it again. but it isn't a bad cereal don't get me wrong. Just wasn't spectacular and doesn't give me a reason to leave my honey-nut cherrios (seeing a pattern here in the ingredients?)<br /><br />For those that need a little something to snack on vs. making this a meal it could be a good option.
55670,B004CYLW7A,A22VNXHU6IZ5MT,Jason P. Pumphrey the movie & music man,0/0,1298505600,Move over Honey Nut Cheerios!,This is tasty cereal.  It's kind of like Honey Nut Cheerios but a heck of a lot better! I'm a bit stanege since I don't really eat cereal the traditional way. I eat it dry. sometimes strait from the box! I like this so much I went and bought three more boxes to put in my pantry!. I usually have some as a snack. as it's much better than chips and candy. The other day I ate some while watching a movie. instead of popcorn. This is very tasy stuff indeed and I hope Kelloggs keeps producing it. Hopefully enough people will like and buy it so it won't get discontunued.
55694,B004CYLW7A,A235NA61RC6YC1,George Dionne,0/0,1297814400,Sweet. nutty. and delicious,How much can be said about a cereal?  Crunchy Nut lives up to it's name.  The O's are crunchy and covered with nuts.  Together they create a sweet taste with a little bit of saltiness.  It's a little on the sugary side. but still tasty for adults.  I swear this combination and taste had been done before in a long lost cereal of whose name I can't remember.

55703,B00141QYMC,A37HCYJX1CTSF3,Poodlelover,15/19,1306022400,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!,BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency. to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1.200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to amazon. but they don't accept edibles..<br /><br />I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch. but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough. like an old piece of leather. very coarse. not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first. because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful. not harmful! But. I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion. severe bloody vomit and explosive. watery diarrhea with blood followed. almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation!<br /><br />I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is. if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged amazon to pull these off the website. before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs. maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way. you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order. you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I just found out Mellow Mut and Vitality dog chews are made in China and manufactured by the same company Dogswell! I will never EVER purchase their products again! I'm reporting them to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration!
55704,B00141QYMC,A1NYJZEHRCK7CF,J. Croff,4/4,1264204800,Dogswell Vitality chicken treats,I have a Basset Hound and a medium mixed breed. They love these little chicken treats. I say chicken and they run to where the bag is kept. It's the one treat I can always get them to do their tricks for! I used to get them at a dog shop in a town over an hour away. Now. I get them on Amazon for a fraction of the price and they're delivered to my door every month (free shipping).
55723,B00141QYMC,AZPCY12SD35SD,Barbara Hall poodle lover,4/5,1310515200,My dogs love these!,These treats are an absolute MUST for my dogs. They would probably stop eating dog food if I gave them more of these. but one nice aspect of these treats is it tells you on the back how many they can have (by dog's weight) daily. My two toy poodles will do just about anything. including chewing the bag open for me. to get these. Except. maybe. eating their dog food dinner first. Dogswell has these treats for vitality. but it  also has these treats for arthritis and other problems too. And besides chicken. they also have duck breast. which my dogs are crazy about. It's so convenient to get them thru Amazon. too.
55737,B00141QYMC,A11WIDIL1DBLYN,Joanna L. Nason Joanna Nason,1/1,1250467200,Great product,AMAZON PLEASE BRING BACK THE 15-16 OUNCE BAGS IN BEEF LIVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Shipping is crazy at some of your stores selling the bigger bags..I have been using this for over 3 years and my German Shep loves them as a treat at night but the little bags are way to small..Thanks Joanna
55738,B00141QYMC,A2QL2IQX7F9FQJ,Victoria Bryan,1/1,1242345600,Dog loves em,My dog loves these. as do the 3 dogs that I walk - and they're all quite fussy. Great for training and easy to stuff in pockets.
55747,B00141QYMC,A2LA5TKLYVTOF0,C. Westover Dachsie Mom,1/1,1231804800,My dog loves these !,My dog (miniature dachshund) is not a treat-eater and turns her nose up at most treats. organic or not.  However. she'll literally bounce her way to me and run like crazy to get one of these.  They're of a softer consistency than the chicken breasts and don't stick in her throad like some of the other dried treats.
55748,B00141QYMC,A1NAF17VJCIL71,Honeybunch,2/3,1307577600,Excellent product,I adopted a 6 year old female Yorkie a year ago. She had been rescued from a puppy mill in Missouri where she had multiple litters of puppies and was caged in a small kennel. She looked pitiful when I got her. She had never had a treat of any kind. but soon understood what it was. These Dogswell Vitality treats with Flaxseed and Vitamins have contributed to transforming her (Brees) coat and skin. She looks beautiful now. I like that this treat has no added hormones. no fillers and no byproducts.  The only downside is that it is made in China.
55763,B00141QYMC,A12KAOSEI6P53R,Christina Edson,1/3,1332806400,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY.... These are made in China!  I do not know if you have seen or read the recent information about dog treats (Chicken Jerky) that are made in China. but they are killing dogs.  I advise you to contact your vet if you do not believe me.  This company states right on their website that they get their treats from china. because they do not want to cause more waste.  I am sorry your company is called DOGSWELL!!!! If you cared about dogs well being then STOP getting your chicken from China and get it from somewhere safe in the US.<br /><br />They are only getting one star because it is needed to post a review.
55768,B005GYS0PW,A1PW7I7DRW3HQD,E. Fisher,1/1,1347494400,Eric's are AWESOME!!!!,I am a mother of three (ages 18. 13 and 5) and I am in my early 40's.  Just thinking about heading to the gym is exhausting  sometimes.  When I started using Eric's Sport Shots I saw drastic improvements in my works outs and my energy levels in general. When I am feeling really groggy in the morning they help clear my head. They also provide great energy without feeling the jitters and I never feel like I crash from them. I also love that these are all natural. I can't get enough!
55777,B000WA49I2,A1DSJAQOVU8Z77,Liz,0/0,1310342400,With Shrimp....WOW,We first bought this olive oil at Sweet Dairy Farms store in southern GA.  It is wonderful with salads but we particularly love it with with shrimp. Put frozen raw shrimp in a ziploc bag -- squirt a healthy amount on the shrimp. seal the bag and shake occasionally to cover.  When thawed cook however you like to.  The hint of lemon and the wonderful olive oil is to die for!!!!
55788,B000HD7N7I,A8QU04SOB2YKM,B.J. Hurt BURT,1/1,1297814400,Love Popcorn,Since we have an abundance of popcorn now. I eat more than I ever did before. It all pops evenly. with little waste. We will be getting more when our supply is exhausted.
55795,B000HD7N7I,A2V0I904FH7ABY,Ram,1/4,1327190400,Contains cancer causing artificial butter flavor,I love this popcorn. until I researched on artificial butter flavor which is based on diacetyl which can cause lung cancer.<br /><br />I would not give this to my family or to anyone else with such harmful chemicals.  You could google for this chemical and find additional information on this.<br /><br />Shame on companies like Conagra which makes products like this.  I have fed this popcorn to my daughter several times and feel guilty that I should have checked on the ingredients before.<br /><br />The 'diacetyl' is neatly concealed. look out for a label which says 'Naturally and Artificially flavored'  - if it contains artificially flavored - just throw the box away.
55803,B004EHXLK6,AW68KVDV7BBRS,Joseph A. Nowak Prophotoman,0/0,1340323200,Not a lot of taste. but great for your health!  and less expensive!,Please note that each box has 5 bars in it. not six or 7.  And each bar is 1.6 ounces. I am VERT happy with these.  There is only one criticism... The taste is dry and bland.  However I eat many things not because they taste good. but because they are healthy.  The nutrition listing does not break down the fiber content by soluble and insoluble fiber. however I see that they do contain psyllium which includesa lot of soluable fiber. which is good.  You need both soluble and insoluble fiber in your diet.  There is only one other fiber bar or cereal bar that I know of that has 12 grams of fiber... Gnu food bars.  Gnu bars are tastier. but are also much more expensive... over $1.45 each bar.  THESE are a little over half that price.  I will try these for awhile to see how they work out compared to Gnu Foods bars.  Should be the same.  I know I like Gnu Foods.  Please note. ONLY 5 BARS IN EACH BOX. not 6 or seven unless Amazon made a special arrangement with the manufacture.. Even the picture above of the box says 5 bars.
55806,B000RUF8GY,A29R4FOZBQC5Z2,TR,9/10,1271116800,Does not work,Pretty simple product to use. unfortunately does not work.  Did not kill ONE weed in my yard.  In some sense all it seemed to do was fertilize.  Weeds are greener 3 days later with no sign of harm.  Product claims 24 hour results....not even close.  What a total waste of money and time.
55818,B000RUF8GY,AG4HQJOARNOQY,James D. DeLude,0/0,1310774400,Use this every year with great results,I was a bit surprised to see the negative reviews on this product.<br /><br />I use this product annually on my New York lawn and it completely destroys all my weeds.  The dandelions will show signs of the use withing 24 hours.  Established thick broad leaf weeds are a bit tougher and will require a bit more attention.  Same with some creeping type clovers which may need multiple applications.<br /><br />I've always been happy with the results and it seems to work better than all the fertilizer/weed killer granules I've tried.
55820,B000RUF8GY,A1KRSEDOGYE207,E. Martinez,0/2,1314316800,KILLED MY LAWN!,I applied it per the directions. 3 days later I have great swaths of dead grass. I just sodded my front yard in March with Floratam. which cost me $1500. Now I'm on the phone with them trying to file a claim. If you value your lawn. don't use this stuff.
55826,B000EZSFVW,A2UW73HU9UMOTY,RB123,0/0,1343865600,Healthy great tasting jerky,I just finished an 8 pack I ordered and just wanted to say this is the best jerky on the market. It has great flavor and it's very healthy. I definitely recommend!!
55831,B000N648Z4,A1ZCYR1VVNURVW,HIlls,1/1,1332892800,moo tubes,moo tubes arrived and are very different in size and much smaller than i assumed.  the ones at my local pet store are more than double the size for not much more money. so i assumed these were the size of the ones at my expensive local pet store.  i was disappointed at their small size and. very unhappy with their varied sizes.  some were half the diameter of the one in the picture and with two dogs. if you dont give them equal sized products. one finishes first and then fights with the other for theirs.  Consistent size does matter with doggies.  these are about three bucks each.  Petsmart has ones that are more than double the size right now for 2.50 each on sale and they are only 3.50 each regular price.  i wont be buying these again.
55839,B000GZY8FC,A2CDFOO1GZ0VTO,Rita Rita,4/4,1268006400,Wonderful Poppyseed Cakes,This filling is wonderful and a good value over buying it in the grocery store.<br />Take a white cake mix and mix it to direction and beat in a can of poppy seed filling and you have a wonderful. moist cake.  You won't reget it!
55848,B000GZY8FC,AYS9AV8EVGOSX,Hella Slomnicki baker,0/0,1234396800,Solo Poppyseed Filling,I have been using the poppyseed filling for years and I am pleased that I can get it now delivered to my house from Amazon.com
55851,B000GZY8FC,A1IX5D2OQU62UK,Olya OK.,2/4,1241136000,Poppy Seed Pie Filling,Too sweet for my taste... I had to add egg yolks to it. or dry poppy seeds and milk. to make it less sweet. I will not buy it again.
55894,B002Y2QTNO,AO5G2L4IS9GRQ,Preemie Mommy,0/0,1326240000,Not good for strong coffee lovers,I like my coffee strong. but if you use a heaping scoop per two cups of water. it is bitter.  So bitter. in fact. that you can smell the bitterness.  I tried using less. but then it doesn't taste like a dark roast.
55912,B003EX2ECM,A1A0Y9E3GK5O3Z,dustin michael remsing,2/3,1327104000,people need to learn,This is a fantastic product. It seems those of us who are professionals in the business of fine food understand this product more. It is a enzyme that naturally occurs in animals. many people probably have eaten it in the past without even knowing it. (I.E pressed ham. in your ham sandwich) One crazy review actually claimed that real meat isn't red. and gave the product 1 star.....as someone who used to be a butcher who has broken down whole animals i find this amusing how misinformed some people are. So to quote a previous review People who don't understand this product are ignorant.
